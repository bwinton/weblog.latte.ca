Quick introduction.  Blog-o! is a weblog shared by Blake and Amy.  It's
split up into categories, which are listed in a sidebar over on the
right there.  If you click on one of the categories, you'll only see
posts in that category, so if you only ever want to see what Amy has
to say about Delphine, you could click on the "delphine" link under
"amy", then bookmark that page and never have to read anything else.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Blog-o! is run using PyBlosxom, a Python blogging doo-dad.  For more
information about that you'll have to talk to Blake (it's Amy writing
here) or click on the graphic over on the right.  I don't know how
it's supposed to be pronounced, but I advocate "pie-blossom".
