Jeez, I just typed out the names of the books I read since my 
last post, and it's clear I read too damn much.  Honestly, I don't
know where I find the time, so don't ask me.
</p>
<p>
(I remember when I was a kid I would say -- well, brag about, really --
how many books I read, and the mothers would look at each other and
roll their eyes and say "Well, I guess you have a lot of time!"  Hah!
Take this, snarky mothers!)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I have time to read them but not blog about them, so this
is going to be short.  Ish.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Akimbo and the Elephants</em> by Alexander McCall Smith</strong>
is also short, a little wee thing which I think took the author as long
to write as it took me to read.  It had a hurried feel, the characters
were thin, it was all a little obvious.  As if some elephant charity had
called the author and said "Write a nice little book about elephants!"
and he knocked it off in an afternoon.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>I Gave My Mom A Castle</em> by Jean Little</strong> is a 
wonderful collection of poems about families and gifts.  Little has
a knack for capturing children's thoughts and voices.  I remember 
enjoying her stuff when I was younger; perhaps now is a good time
to revisit it.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Père Goriot</em> by Honoré de Balzac</strong>
is one of my New Year's Resolution books, because it has a character
named Delphine in it.  It might even be the character that my Aunt
Delphine is named after, although naming your kid after this
Delphine seems like asking for trouble.  Anyway, Balzac is one
pessimistic bastard and almost everyone in this book is scheming
and dishonest, and those that aren't mostly get screwed in the end.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Breastfeeding Made Simple: Seven Natural Laws for
Nursing Mothers</em> by Nancy Mohnbacher and Kathleen 
Kendall-Tackett</strong> is an excellent book on nursing.  I got
it out so I could look it over and decide whether to recommend
it to a friend, but I ended up learning a bunch of stuff myself.  It
approaches nursing from the perspective of what's going on and
how you can make the natural process work for you, like growing
a seed, rather than giving a series of steps on How To Nurse, like
building an Ikea bookshelf.
</p>
<p>
I think this book should be recommended reading for every expectant
or nursing mother.
</p>
<p>
It also has a <a href="http://www.breastfeedingmadesimple.com/">fairly
tacky website</a> which might have some useful stuff in it.  Check
out that title!  Now that's professional!  (Ah yes: 
"&lt;meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 4.0"&gt;"
Always a good way to make a crappy impression.)
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Culture of Fear: Why Americans Are Afraid Of
The Wrong Things</em> by Barry Glassner</strong> is a nice,
reassuring book, in the sense that you don't really have to
be afraid of all the things the media would like you to be 
afraid of, but very unreassuring in that it give you 
the sense that people are very
stupid and can't seem to think for themselves.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Sir Charles: Wit and Wisdom of Charles Barkley</em> 
by Charles Barkley and Rick Reilly</strong>; Charles Barkley is
a pretty funny guy, in that he says stuff that everyone else is
scared to and he's usually right.  What I would give for this kind
of self-assurance.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Don't Get Too Comfortable</em> by David Rakoff</strong>.
Apparently if you are a good enough writer you can get someone
to pay you to do crazy stuff like visit a cryogenics lab, or fly 
the Concorde, or interview some dude at the Log Cabin Republicans,
just so you can write about it.  That's what this book is, and 
it's pretty funny and well-written and occasionally thought-provoking.
(I liked the part about the faux-poverty.)
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Understand Your Child's Growing Mind</em> by Christine 
Healy</strong> is another interesting, science-based book about
a parenting topic.  It's pretty dense, covering lots of ground
with respect to mental development, but readable.
I would recommend this to
anyone concerned with their child's intellect.  
</p>
<p>
The book has lots of 
neatly sidebarred tips on how to help prepare your child's mind
for reading, mathematics, etc.  Unfortunately if you added up
all the sidebars you would end up with about eight hundred
bulleted items, and if you tried to follow them you would never 
have time to brush your own teeth, you would be so busy massaging 
your kid's brain.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Dress Your Best</em> by Clinton Kelly and Stacy London</strong>
is basically <em>What Not To Wear</em> in book form.  It's divided
up by body type with tips for each type, but there are general tips
for everyone scattered throughout the book, so you have to read the
whole thing to get maximum utility out of it.  I managed to glean a
full page of tips from it, but sadly there was no five thousand dollar
credit card in the book, nor anyone to babysit for a week while I 
shop.  I guess looking fabulous is going to have to wait.
