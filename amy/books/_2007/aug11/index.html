<strong><em>Dangerous Planet: Natural Disasters That Changed History</em>
by Bryn Barnard.</strong>  This is another book by the <em>Outbreak</em>
dude, and I didn't like it as much but probably just because I
have more of an affinity for disgusting pustulent diseases than I
do for scary natural (and other) disasters.  This book has the
same basic format; each chapter is dedicated to a different
disaster, describing how the disaster happened and how it
changed the course of history.  Among other things, Barnard
discusses the Great Fire of London and its effect on how buildings
and cities are constructed; the two (not one but two!) typhoons
which devastated the army of Kublai Khan and protected Japan
from invasion in the 1200s, leading to a certain sense of 
invincibility in the Japanese; and of course the classic
asteroid which wiped out the dinosaurs.
</p>
<p>
This book is beautifully designed and well-illustrated, clearly
written and informative.
</p>

<strong><em>Your Four-Year-Old: Wild and Wonderful</em> by
Louise Bates Ames</strong>.  I had to read this to see what it
had to say about four-year-olds, which my mom friends and I have
already observed are bossy and braggy as hell.  Ames agrees,
although she gives it a more positive spin; she says if you
can view your four-year-old's noisy, pushy arrogance with
as much amused detachment as you can muster the year will go
much more smoothly.
</p>
<p>
As usual the observations in this book are spot on, and very
helpful in distinguishing your child's personality from the
phases she's going through.  It gets a little dated sometimes
but that's part of the fun of it.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, the next book in the series is subtitled "Sunny
and Serene".  Hooray!
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Mac is Not A Typewriter</em> by Robin Williams</strong>.
I only read this because Blake had it out, and a lot of it was
stuff my brother taught me back in Grade 11 ("The Amiga is not
a typewriter!"); don't use underlines, don't use spaces when
you should use tab stops.  Williams also gets into fancy stuff
like Kerning, and she is very keen — perhaps
obsessively so — on curly quotes and em-dashes.  She uses 
some very strong words to describe straight quotes, words which
make me think I am dealing with an ill person and should perhaps
disregard her advice.  Really, they're quotation marks.
</p>
<p>
I am also leery— born perhaps of having been
introduced to computers through Unix in the early nineties — of
using non-ASCII characters, really ever, but especially in
email and on the web.  Williams even suggests using curly quotes
in filenames!  I'm sorry, I don't even use spaces in filenames.
That's craziness.  Excuse me, I am going to go and grow a long
beard now, and perhaps refrain from bathing for a few weeks.  I
must dust my green-screen ASCII terminal.
</p>
<p>
At the cottage last week I read <strong><em>Home Leave</em>
by Libby Purves</strong> which was fantastic and I loved it; it's
about four siblings, the children of a diplomat, who were hauled
all around the world when they were young.  It's about what home
means, and of course I related to the situation of having your
sibling as your only constant for your whole childhood.  There 
is a lot of talk of children and babies in the book and Purves 
writes so realistically and richly about children; they don't 
disappear or only feature as plot or characterization devices,
or worse just as noisy perplexing ciphers, as they so often do
in novels.  Purves knows how to write about how children
change you and affect you for better and for worse.  I loved the
characters and the stories and the ideas.  And
the ending; the ending was immensely satisfying.
</p>
<p>
I also read <strong><em>Pug Hill</em> by Alison Pace</strong>
which was pretty disappointing after the Purves.  This is a 
book about a thirty-one year old in Manhatten looking for 
love and sorting herself out.  The protagonist annoyed the
crap out of me with her whining and self-absorption and
judgementalness and immaturity, and she didn't get all that 
much better through
the book, although I think she was supposed to.  It was like
Bridget Jones in Manhattan, except blessedly free of talk about
dieting.
