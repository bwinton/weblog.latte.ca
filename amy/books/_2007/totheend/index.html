Wow, I didn't realize I hadn't updated my book log since 
August.  That's insane!  Book log updates take a long
time, so I guess I put off doing them, but eight months?
Here are the books I read from August to the end
of last year, and I'll post this year's books in another
post.  One day.  Maybe in August.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Three Junes</em> by Julia Glass</strong> was a
vacation read I borrowed from Baba, and it was a great book.
I am looking at all the notes I made on it after I read it,
and sadly despite having written the notes and now reading
them, I don't remember much of the story, which doesn't reflect 
well on my attempts to read more attentively and remember
what I read.  Anyway, it's one of those novels with dozens
of different characters whose lives intersect in interesting
ways.  The characters are beautifully drawn and the intersections
of their lives are plausible and enjoyable to read about.
</p>
<p>
I sound like an idiot when I try and write about fiction!  Maybe
non-fiction too.  Oh, I wish I were smarter.  You would think
all this reading would help.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Get Smart: Nine Sure Ways to Help Your Child Succeed 
in School</em> by Ronald Dietel</strong>.  I think I picked this
up because it was on display at the library.  That is to say, I
didn't order it especially, and I'm not worried about Delphine's
academic development or anything.  I'm not even particularly 
worried about whether she "succeeds" in school; the question of
whether getting good grades can be considered succeeding is very
much up in the air for me at the moment.  Anyway, that's now,
but back in September when I read this book I thought it would be
cool to know how to help my kid succeed in school.
</p>
<p>
Dietel starts by commenting on the fact that apparently there is
no time to be a kid any more, and there's big pressure on even the
smallest of children to succeed in school.  "The words 'let them be
kids' are becoming a faint echo of the past."  And that's all he
says.  He doesn't say that sucks, he doesn't say you should be a
counterpoint to the pressure in your kid's life, he doesn't say 
maybe achieving in school isn't the be all and end all.  And I guess
he wouldn't!  If he felt that way I bet he would have written a 
different book.
</p>
<p>
He goes on the talk about the different factors which affect your
kid's success at school (specifically: ability, effort, attitute, 
school quality,
teacher quality, school learning habits, home learning habits, evaluations,
communication).  And then for each factor he talks about how you can 
affect and improve it, varying from study techniques to working with
your kid's teacher to homework routines.  It was a pretty useful book,
for what it was.  I am older and wiser* now than I was when I read the 
book, and have some different
perspectives on school and learning and how much involvement I
should have in my kid's life, so even though I only read this book
a few months ago I think I would approach it a lot differently 
if I read it today.
</p>
<p>
* I am older and wiser now mainly because of a book I just read
called <em>Punished by Rewards</em> by Alfie Kohn which has blown
my mind and made me rethink everything about interacting with my
children, but in the best possible way.  I will post about it 
sometime.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Not-So-Star-Spangled Life of Sunita Sen</em> by Mitali 
Perkins</strong>; another just-picked-it-up choice.  This is a 
young adult novel about an Indian-American teenager who is 
torn between her traditional grandparents and her desire to
be an ordinary American girl.  I generally liked the story
and the message of the book, but I am spoiled by all the
Canadian books I usually read and was really put off by all
the American references.  I don't see why an American book 
shouldn't have American references, but there's something nice
about books set in Canada.  They're easier to read.  I expect
the same is true about books set in Sweden if you're Swedish.
I also though that Sunita's boyfriend's exoticization of Indian
culture was kind of creepy, but it was presented positively in the book. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance</em> by 
Atul Gawande</strong> is a book about how to succeed in medicine,
or any endeavour which involves risk and responsibility.  Gawande's
three core requirements for success are Diligence, Doing Right
and Ingenuity.  He illustrates them with fascinating examples
from the field, from the difficulty in getting people (doctors!)
to wash their hands to the subtleties of conduct in the examining
room, to the near-magical improvements in neonatal survival
after the introduction of the Apgar score.  This is a wonderfully
written, interesting and thought-provoking book, whether you
are a doctor or just want to be smarter and better at what you
do every day.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, here are Gawande's five "Suggestions for Becoming
A Positive Deviant":
</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask an unscripted question; be interested in someone else,
surprise them, learn something about the people you see every day,
find their humanity.</li>
<li>Don't complain; it drags you and everyone else down, it is
unhelpful and boring.</li>
<li>Count something, track something; be a scientist in the world.
If you count something you find interesting, you will learn something
interesting.</li>
<li>Write something; add some small observations about your world;
step back and think about a problem; make yourself a part of the
larger conversation.</li>
<li>Change; respond to new ideas; recognize the inadequacies in what
you do and seek out solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Find something new to try, count how often you succeed, write about
it, ask people what they think.  See if you can keep the conversation
going.  These are words I try to live by, even in my relatively small
world.  I strive for constant improvement.  That sounds really dorky,
but it's true.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>How Doctors Think</em> by Jerome Groopman</strong>.  Another
fantastic book!  It's great when I get two good books in a row.  This
is a fascinating book about, as it says, how doctors think, and mainly
how they diagnose.  Groopman talks about the inadequacies in medical
training, how doctors feel about you as a patient, how they come to
their conclusions and how they can get stuck in stereotyped views of
you and your condition.  Most importantly he writes about how you can
ask questions to understand your doctor's thinking and perhaps gently
steer them in a different direction if you feel like they are not giving
enough thought to your condition, or if you just want to understand
their diagnosis better.
</p>
<p>
Everyone who is a patient should read this book, and doctors should
too.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Simple Home: The Luxury of Enough</em> by Sarah 
Nettleton</strong>.  This is mainly house porn; lots of pretty pictures
of "simple" houses; houses that are exactly as big and complex as they 
need to 
be, and no more.  Pretty and inspirational.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Supernanny: How To Get The Best From Your Children</em> by 
Jo Frost</strong>  and <strong><em>Nanny Wisdom: Our Secrets for Raising 
Healthy, Happy 
Children — From Newborns to Preschoolers</em> by Justine Walsh 
and Kim Nicholson</strong>.  I read these books because I was looking
for inspiration on how to discipline Cordelia, who was just getting
into a bit of a hellish phase.  Both books favoured timeouts, which I
tried and which failed miserably because Cordelia would either be
completely happy on the "naughty step", or Delphine would go over and
comfort her.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, otherwise these are pretty good books which emphasise what I
consider to be the cornerstone of good parenting, a structured routine.
They also both give a shoutout to an early bedtime, another parenting
tool which I think is sadly underused these days.
</p>
<p>
However, I wish the <em>Nanny Wisdom</em> nannies would stick 
to general parenting advice 
and stay away from advice on nursing, which is... well, it's none of
their business and they don't know what they're talking about.  They
say you should stop nursing at a year and they say that at some point
your milk dries up and your kid is just nursing for pleasure.  Which
is not true at all!  They clearly overstepped the bounds of their
own expertise there.  If you want good nursing advice, the book for
you is <em>Breastfeeding Made Simple</em> by Nancy Mohrbacher and Kathleen 
Kendall-Tackett.  Not some nanny book.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Finding Flow: The Psychology of Engagement with Everyday 
Life</em> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</strong>.  Flow is what you
experience when you are completely involved in what you are doing, 
when you feel simultaneously focused and transcendent.  It doesn't
happen very often, and Csikszentmihalyi has studied when it happens
and how.  This is a book about how to fully engage in life, how
to live without waste of time or potential.  If you don't believe
in an afterlife then you know we've only got maybe eighty years
of consciousness, and you'd better believe I don't want to waste
any of mine.  This is a wonderful book about finding happiness
and fulfillment, sometimes where you least expect it (like at work!).
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Factory Girl</em> by Barbara Greenwood</strong>.  
Barbara Greenwood is a lady in my choir who writes really neat
history books for children, which combine historical facts with
a narrative.  She tells the story for a few pages and then breaks
off and talks about the facts behind the story.  This was an
interesting read for me because it made me realize how much I
bluff when I'm reading historical fiction. For example, the character
in the book works in a sweatshop that makes shirtwaists.  Sure,
shirtwaists, I thought!  Cool!  It was only three pages later when
Greenwood breaks out and says, in effect, "Here is what a shirtwaist
is" along with a few illustrations out of the Eaton's catalogue, that
I realize I had no idea what it was, really.  Similarly she tells
what, specifically, you could buy with the girl's meagre pay.  I
found this to be a very effective teaching technique; I
think you're more likely to ask questions about what you're reading
if you know that the answers are coming up, and I think these
books encourage curiosity.  I look
forward to reading more of Greenwood's books with the girls.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Bones to Ashes</em> by Kathy Reichs</strong>.  This was
better than the last Kathy Reichs.  I think I need another go-to 
mystery writer, though, because Reichs continues to annoy with her
sentence fragments and her "it's on the tip of my tongue" intuitive
mystery-solving.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Send: The Essential Guide to Email for Office and Home</em> by 
David Shipley and Will Schwalbe</strong>.  This was useful but I can't
remember exactly what I learned that I didn't already know.  Oh, I guess
I learned that it is considered okay to put the entire message in 
your subject header (if your message is short).  That always annoys me,
but I guess if no-one else minds I'll have to put up with it.  Also 
apparently you are only supposed to have one topic per email; if you
want to talk to someone about two things you should send two emails.
That sounds really maddening to me, but I have learned from experience
that some people just don't read (or comprehend) more than one
item or paragraph in an email message.  Also I suppose having one topic
per message might make it easier to file, if you're a dinosaur and you
still use folders instead of tags.
</p>
<p>
And that's the end of my 2007 reading!  I can't believe Cordelia is still
asleep!  I might even be able to post about what I've read in the last
three months sometime before the end of April.
