<p>I joined a book club in 2008, in part to force me to read
more fiction, and to think about what I read more.  In
spite of how much I read — well, maybe because I read
so much — I don't think about what I read as much as
I would like to.  Knowing I'm going to have to talk intelligently
about the books forces me to read more mindfully, which
improves all my reading.</p>
<p><strong><em>My Sister's Keeper</em></strong> <strong>by Jodi Picoult</strong> is a book
about a girl, Anna, who is born to provide her sister 
Kate with bone marrow.  Kate gets better but then
gets sick again, over and over, and Anna keeps getting
tapped for more and more biological matter.  I quite
enjoyed the book, I think (it was a while ago, but I
know I didn't hate it, except the ending which was
egregiously heart-rending), and there was plenty to talk about: the
ethics of designer babies, issues of identity and
responsibility to family, and a bizarre subplot about
a lawyer with an anachronistically shameful disorder
of his own.  Pretty good but don't run out and read
it or anything.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Girls</em></strong> <strong>by Lori Larsen</strong> is a book about 
conjoined twins living in a small town near London,
Ontario.  This is a beautifully crafted book, not
just about the sisters but about life in small-town
Canada.  I found the characters so compelling and real that 
I kept feeling I could Google them to find out their
ultimate fate.  The one weird thing is that although
the girls in the book are almost my exact contemporaries
I kept feeling the book was set in the fifties or
sixties.  I don't know if that was intentional on 
the part of the author, to evoke the nostalgia of
small-town life or of the cloistered nature of the
girls' lives, or not, but it quite jarring when one
of the sisters started looking things up on the
Internet herself.  Other than that I really enjoyed 
this book.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Friday Night Knitting Club</em></strong> <strong>by Kate Jacobs</strong>
is about a New York woman who owns a knitting store
and has a teenage daughter and meets up with an old
friend and, I dunno, hilarity ensues.  As you might
guess I wasn't overwhelmed with love for this book.
It was fluffy like a ball of mohair and seemed
contrived.</p>
<p><strong><em>Last Days of Dogtown</em></strong> <strong>by Anita Diamant</strong> is a
book about the various inhabitants of a dying town
on the Massachusetts coast.  It's gloomy reading
but compelling.  The characters are well-drawn and
the stories are interesting and credible.  A worthwhile
read.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Memory-Keeper's Daughter</em></strong> <strong>by Kim Edwards</strong>
is about a woman who, upon being asked to take a 
doctor's baby daughter, born with Down syndrome, to
an institution, instead kidnaps the daughter and
takes her to live in Pittsburgh.  Meanwhile the 
doctor tells his wife that the baby died and they
go on to have a messed-up marriage and never quite
find happiness.  A bunch of things happen and 
everyone lives happily ever after, more or less.</p>
<p>This was another good book which didn't blow
me away.  It seemed quite contrived and book clubbish,
with lots of Talking Points and Dramatic Turns.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ender's Game</em></strong> <strong>by Orson Scott Card</strong>.  Yes, we
read <strong>Ender's Game</strong> in book club.  Weird!  About
half of the book club members don't read science
fiction, so it was an interesting meeting.  Anyway,
so this is another book about a kid who is born
for a special purpose, this time to be the child
genius who saves mankind by having the a unique
combination of video gaming skillz and innocence
required to defeat an alien species which threatens
mankind.  You have to suspend your disbelief pretty
high over a couple of things in this book, but if
you give yourself over to Card you're rewarded with
a good yarn and some interesting things to think
over, like the ethics of using children to fight
wars, and the similarity between modern warfare
and video games.  Also the techniques of military
training, the value of adding in bits to a book which
don't really make sense in that book but pave the way
for a sequal, preemptive war, genocide, whether we 
could recognize the "humanity" in alien species, and
what form those species might take, collective 
intelligence versus individual minds and the inability
to truly know another person. Lots to talk about.</p>
<p>I actually read <strong>Only You Can Save Mankind</strong> by Terry
Pratchett as a companion piece to this (according
to Blake there is a whole subgenre of "video games
that turn out to be real" SF out there).  They're
quite different books but they're neck and
neck in terms of quality of characterization and
depth of insight, with Pratchett coming out ahead
with Humour over Earnestness.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Thousand Splendid Suns</em></strong> <strong>by Khaled Hosseini</strong>
is my big winner this year, in terms of fiction.  This
book ripped me up.  The writing is gorgeous and the
characters are instantly compelling, but the plot
is gruelling and horrifying.  I wept for the women 
in this book, and at the same time I learned so much
about Kabul and the recent history of Afghanistan.
I sent my mother a copy of this book and she read it
in two days.  Fantastic book.</p>
