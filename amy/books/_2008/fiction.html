<h4>Kids' Fiction</h4>
<p><strong><em>The Treasure at Greene Knowe</em></strong>, and
<strong><em>The Stones at Greene Knowe</em></strong> <strong>by Lucy Boston</strong> are books
in a series I started reading last year, about an old
house with lots of secrets and ghosts and things. 
I have always loved books about houses with lots of
secrets and ghosts, hidden passageways and so on,
and this series is no exception.  It's very well
written and I'm looking forward to sharing it with
Delphine.</p>
<p>I had to pick up <strong><em>A Coyote's In The House</em></strong> <strong>by 
Elmore Leonard</strong> because I wanted to know how he would
handle young adult fiction.  Well, first of all he
managed to contrive a situation in which he could
legitimately use the word "bitch" a lot.  Kudos!  This
is a book written from the point of view of a coyote
contemplating the life of a domesticated dog.  The
characters are well-drawn and the story is good.
I liked this book.</p>
<h4>Adult Fiction</h4>
<p>I read <strong><em>Life on the Refrigerator Door</em></strong> <strong>by Alice 
Kuipers</strong> because it was recommended in the <em>Globe
and Mail</em> Books section, and because I was intrigued 
by the premise: the book is written almost entirely in 
notes between a woman and her teenage daughter, left,
as you might guess, on the refrigerator door.  Surprisingly
enough, the conceit works and the story is well-told.
It's a tear-jerker but ends on a hopeful note.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bad Monkeys</em></strong> <strong>by Matt Ruff</strong> is a book which
Blake got me to read because he really enjoyed it.
It's a SF mystery thriller about a vigilante assassin, full of
plot twists and lies within lies which keep you guessing
and manage to hang together right to the final page.
It's one of those books which, upon finishing it,
you immediately want to start it again so you can see
if it all fits together properly.
A great book if you like that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I put <strong><em>I Am Legend</em></strong> <strong> (and other stories) by Richard 
Matheson</strong> on hold
at the library back when the movie came out — I do that
a lot, read books which have been made into movies 
without bothering to see the movie.  I am often intrigued
by the premise of a movie but know that the book will be
better (not to mention cheaper).  Anyway, everyone else
in Toronto did the same thing before me so it took ages
for my turn to come, and the memory of the unseen movie
had long faded by the time I got the book.  I like horror,
though, so I gave it a read and quite enjoyed the title
story.  It's the story of a guy who remains uninfected
when a disease very  much like vampirism spreads over the
world.  Kind of a cool post-apocalyptic story with a 
grim but satisfying ending.</p>
<p>I started reading the other stories in the book, but
they were all kind of samish and didn't do much for me.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Bone Garden</em></strong> <strong>by Tess Gerritsen</strong> is a book
my mother sent me, a mystery about a lady who finds some
bones in her garden and goes off to Maine to investigate
them.  It was pretty good.  I've seen some people say
that Tess Gerritsen is really great and she's won a 
couple of awards and been nominated for an Edgar, but
this book didn't blow me away.  Maybe I should read
<strong>Vanish</strong>, the book which got all the awards.  (Except
apparently the Toronto Public Library doesn't have a
copy.  Go TPL!)</p>
<p>I picked up <strong><em>Alice in Jeopardy </em></strong> <strong>by Ed McBain</strong> and 
<strong><em>Watchman</em></strong> <strong>by Ian Rankin</strong> in summer as my
fluffy, mindless reading.  I chose them because
I like the authors and that's what the library had on
the shelves, and I managed to get a McBain book that
isn't an 87th Precinct book and a Rankin that isn't
a Rebus book.  However, they were both pretty good reads, 
definitely fulfilling what I required of them.</p>
