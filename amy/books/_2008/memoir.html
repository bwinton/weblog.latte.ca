<p>I read <strong><em>The Greek for Love: A Memoir of Sorrow
and Joy</em></strong> <strong>by James Chatto</strong>  because
it was favourably reviewed in the <em>Globe</em>, and because
it's set (is it called "set" when it's non-fiction?)
in Corfu, a part of Greece I have some memoirish
familiarity with due to my obsessive childhood love of
Gerald Durrell.  I thought it would be interesting to
read a different, more modern perspective on the island.
Also this book is about someone losing a child.  Like
most parents I am consumed with fear that I will lose
(nice euphemism, as if I'm going to put them
down in a restaurant and forget to take them with me,
like a pair of gloves or an umbrella) one of my
children and my life will be destroyed.  I know 
I can't reasonably be assured that both my children
will survive me, but the matter of whether or not I can
go on with my life in the event of a tragedy is much
more in my control.  So I rather like to read about 
people surviving and carrying on after the death of
a child.</p>
<p>This book provided admirably on both counts; it's
an evocative sketch of Corfu in the seventies (? I think
it was the seventies): the weather, the landscape, the
crazy locals and the lovely ones.  It was also a 
beautifully written story of loss and how the author and his wife
dealt with it and moved through it.</p>
<p>So funny
story.  It was coming up to Blake's birthday and as 
usual I had no idea what to get him.  Mostly Blake
wants arcane pieces of electronic equipment that
usually cost a few hundred dollars.  So I buy him
socks and underwear, and chocolate-covered marzipan.
Well, he's a reader too so this year I went to the
local second-hand bookstore and stood gormlessly in
front of the SF/Fantasy section, apparently mistaking
him for my first boyfriend who would read pretty much
any SF or fantasy.  After a few moments I came to my
senses and remembered that if 80% of everything is
crap, 99% of genre fiction is crap and likely Blake
had already read the 1% of SF that isn't.  So I 
shuffled disconsolately around the store until I got
to the non-fiction section, which as you might guess
is my favourite place.  </p>
<p>Now the problem with buying
books for another reader, especially when your
interests overlap somewhat, is that it's hard to 
tell whether you have picked up a particular book
because you think the other person would enjoy it,
or because you want to get your own hands on it.  (We
actually have a convention in our family that it's
fine to read a book, carefully, before you give it 
to someone as a gift.)  So there I was standing in
front of the non-fiction books trying to figure out
what I could give to Blake that wouldn't be too transparently
something I wanted to read myself, when a peculiar
thought came to me:</p>
<p>"I wish Dave were here, he would know what to get."</p>
<p>Now why my brother, who lives on the other side of
the planet and who hasn't seen Blake for years, would
know better than I who spend every day with the man
what Blake would like to read I don't know, but just
then my eyes lit upon the Bill Bryson books and I
remembered that Dave had said something favourable
about Bryson recently in his blog.  I also remembered
that Blake had enjoyed another of his books, and so
for Blake's birthday I got him <strong><em>The Lost 
Continent: Travels in Small-Town America</em></strong> <strong>by Bill 
Bryson</strong>.    And then read 
it. Well, I let Blake read it first.  And it was
very good, and I enjoyed it.  Bill Bryson rocks, I 
should read more of his stuff.</p>
<p>Incidentally Blake really liked it too — I had
forgotten that Bryson also wrote <em>The Mother
Tongue</em>, a book Blake really enjoys.  So apparently
Dave actually <em>is</em> the go-to guy when I need a gift
idea for my own husband.  This is what happens
when you marry your brother.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dreams from my Father: A Story of Race and 
Inheritance</em></strong> <strong>by Barack Obama</strong> came
to me in a package from my mother, who had received it
in turn from my brother.  I believe Dave either got it
from a friend or lent it to a friend before sending it
to Mum, so our copy has been read by four people
on two continents.  Right now it's stuck on our bookshelf
because Blake wants to read it but hasn't gotten to
it.  If anyone reading this would like it let me know
and I will send it on, because it's a fantastic book.
(Blake can get it from the library if he really wants
to read it.)</p>
<p>A while ago I posted about why I was happy that Obama
won the election, and a large part of that post was
informed by what I know about the man from this book.
It's wonderfully well-written and Obama is clearly a
very intelligent person who isn't satisfied with 
just seeing the surfaces of things or with simple
explanations.  This book is about identity and
personal history and I found it particularly interesting
because I related to issues of constructing identity
from family, of being an immigrant, and of having a
mobile, unsettled childhood.  It was a wonderful
read and I am looking forward to reading 
<em>The Audacity of Hope</em>, and anything else
Obama has the time to write.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Long Way Down: An Epic Journey by Motorcycle from 
Scotland to South Africa</em></strong> <strong>by Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman</strong>
is the companion book to the reality series of the
same name, about McGregor and Boorman's motorcycle
ride from John O'Groats to Cape Town.  Good book, pretty
much like <em>Long Way Round</em> which I read in 2006.
I liked reading a new perspective on Africa.</p>
<p>Morgan secured her nomination for Sister-in-law Of
The Year when she gave me <strong><em>Slash</em></strong> <strong>by Slash and
Anthony Bozza</strong> for my birthday.  (And now that I
think of it, she borrowed it as soon as I finished it.
I guess my new family is more like my old family than
I sometimes realize.)  I loved this book.  This is
going to sound odd, but it gave me new insight into
the roots of the Guns N' Roses sound.  When I started
listening to them in 1988 or 89 I was basically coming
to rock music cold, with a listening history of almost
exclusively pop music.  I've gained a clue or two since
then but never re-examined GN'R, just maintained my
uncomplicated love for their music.  So it was very 
interesting to put that music into the context of the
glam and punk scenes it was born from, scenes I
didn't have Clue One about back when I was a pimply
Good Girl teenager in northern Saskatchewan.  </p>
<p>This book also gave me a more subtle appreciation for
the contributions of the non Slash/Axl members of
the band, who I had previously largely disregarded.  Especially
Steve Adler; I used to think he was pretty much an
interchangable Lego-piece drummer, but Slash convinced
me that his casually hyper rock style contributed significantly
to the sound of <em>Appetite for Destruction</em>.</p>
<p>This book also made me appreciate just how much crap
you can throw at a human body and have it 
survive.  Well, more or less survive, if you have a pacemaker
anyway.  Slash had a weird, undisciplined childhood and a
crazy life but he is grounded and disciplined and
seems like a decent (in the "honest" sense if not
the "proper" sense) guy. Fun book.</p>
<p>I took out <strong><em>The Vanished Landscape</em></strong> <strong>by Paul Johnson</strong>
because I was looking for books about Staffordshire, where
my mother is from.  The subtitle of the book is 
"A 1930s Childhood in the Potteries", which is exactly
what my mother had.  Funnily enough, my mother's childhood
and Johnson's couldn't have been more different.  Johnson
is the child of middle-class parents, his father an art teacher 
and his mother
one of those women who does nice things for poor people.
They moved from Manchester to Stoke when Johnson spent
his early childhood.  </p>
<p>My mother, on the other hand, is
the child of working class parents and she grew up in
a small town near Stoke, one of those pastoral Shire-like
English towns, with hedgerows and sheep and little walls made of
stones.  The little towns that 
no longer exist because they've turned
into exurbs of nearby cities.  Anyway, Johnson is
a beautiful writer and describes Stoke wonderfully,
especially the "vanished landscape" of the title, the
old potbanks and wastelands born of the pottery
industry.  His father taught him to see the
Burtynsky-esque beauty in that kind of landscape.
I also loved Johnson's descriptions of his family and
other people, and his stories of a much more
unfettered childhood than today's children are allowed.</p>
<p>My mother read this book, too, and it got her blood boiling
because Johnson is an old-school English snob, going on
about how the poor people (that's my Mum) are all dirty
and ignorant and need charity.  As it turns out Johnson
(who I had never heard of before) came to America and 
was an advisor for the Republican party.  No surprise
there.  </p>
<p>I will probably read more Johnson because I love how he
writes, but I wish there were more memoirs of Staffordshire
out there.  Like Barack Obama, I am continually 
searching for my identity through my family history.</p>
