<p><strong><em>Unconditional Parenting</em></strong> <strong>by Alfie Kohn</strong>. If you have been
paying attention here, you  know how much I love Alfie Kohn. But
I've been reluctant to read this, his parenting book, because I
knew it would force me to raise the bar on my parenting, to really 
think about what's behind how I treat my kids.  And I was right, this
was a good read but a tough one.  This isn't a book with a bunch
of techniques or tricks for managing your kids (Alyson Schafer is
your girl for that), but rather a discussion of how traditional
parenting techniques put your kids in the position of having to
earn your love in the form of rewards, praise and attention 
(or avoid your approbation in the form of punishment, time outs
or "consequences").  </p>
<p>Kohn's radical thesis is that children
are human beings and deserving of love and respect no matter
how much they fuck up, and equal love and respect (not more)
when they get it right. He writes about "working with" children
rather than "doing to" them.</p>
<p>Unconditional parenting is hard; it goes so contrary to 
popular wisdom which is all about praise and consequences. It's
also, to be honest, sometimes hard to treat your kids like 
human beings when they act like maniacs, or idiots, or animals.
You have to really try hard to see the human being inside that
crispy exterior and try and respond to her. Which can be
hard when you're tired or in a hurry or otherwise 
resource-challenged.  (One of Kohn's list of recommendations
is "Don't be in a hurry", which is great advice if you can
take it.)</p>
<p>Kohn's arguments are, as always, compelling, well-researched 
and well-supported;
the notes and references seemed to start about two-thirds of
the way through the book. (That's one thing I missed from 
Alyson Schafer's latest book: it just ended. No index, no
references, no further reading, nothing. Girl needs a new
publisher.)  </p>
<p>This is a must-read for me.  I would buy this book if I
weren't such a cheap bastard.</p>
<p><strong><em>Notes from a Small Island</em></strong> <strong>by Bill Bryson</strong>. Bill Bryson
lived in England for a long time (Wikipedia says over twenty
years), and he wrote this book after
he decided to move back to America. For his last hurrah he did
a whirlwind train tour around Britain and wrote all about it.
I love Bill Bryson and I love England, and I love train travel,
so I thought I would love this book, but I found it kind of
sameish after a while. I can't put my finger on why, exactly.
Although I can tell you that despite the fact I went to lots of
different places when I was in England, my trip and Bill's
hardly overlapped at all, so I missed that thrill of reading
about a place I'm familiar with.</p>
<p>My favourite thing about this book is how Bryson gets all sappy
and sentimental about England, because I love it too (although
in a nice-place-to-visit way; I couldn't live there). I was
a bit perplexed, though, by his insistence that Brits are so thoughtful
and polite. In my experience Brits tend to be a bit mean and
rude, if anything (sorry to generalize; usual disclaimers
apply, some of my best friends, etc). They're hot on "manners"
and behaving "properly", but not so much on actually considering
others. Maybe I'm wrong - I was there in middle school
which isn't exactly a hotbed of consideration on any continent.</p>
<p><strong><em>Design Ideas for Home Storage</em></strong> <strong>by Elaine Martin Petrowski</strong>.
Take a guess what this one's about. Yes! A useful book with
lots of good ideas, and plenty of photos (some apparently ripped
straight from the Ikea catalogue). What makes this one a keeper,
though, is that it includes the dimensions you'll need to
make storage design decisions: how high is a kitchen counter,
how much room do you need to hang a pair of pants, etc.  And
last but not least there are instructions for a few simple
storage projects you can build yourself, like a window seat
built from store-bought over-refrigerator cabinets. Brilliant!</p>
<p><strong><em>Ishmael</em></strong> <strong>by Daniel Quinn</strong>.  Okay, my "friend" Ellen picked
this book as our book club read this month. Our relationship might
never be the same. When I found out the premise of this novel
(a philosophy of sustainability explained through a telepathic 
Socratic conversation between a person and a gorilla) I knew I
would hate it. I know, you're not supposed to prejudge things, 
but when you reach a certain age and you've read a few things, 
you know what you're going to like. And what you're going to
hate.</p>
<p>I hated this.  Generally I hate books that are discourses
on philosophy disguised as a novel. I hated <em>Jonathan Livingston
Seagull</em>, I hated <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>.
Okay, that's not true, I guess I liked and found value in both
those books when I read them (when I was much younger), but 
both of them left a bad
taste in my mouth, like I'd been spoken down to. And maybe 
because I'm older and have a stronger sense of my own morality
and philosophy, <em>Ishmael</em> was a thousand times worse.  I felt 
like I was being spoon-fed something really quite
simple: the whole message of the book could be delivered in
a few pages. And on top of that the thesis of the book is
ridiculously flawed: the author manages to lump all the subtlety
and complexity of every non-Western culture into one group,
the "leavers", and says that they're lovely and good people
because they don't take more than they need, not like us
selfish bastards. It's just all so stupid and patronising 
(to the other cultures this time, not to me).</p>
<p>Should make for a good book club discussion, anyway.  (I'm
pretty sure Ellen hates it too - I wonder how everyone
else feels.)</p>
<hr>
<p>Wow, every paragraph in this post has a parenthetical insertion.  (Except 
this one. (Whoops!))  I think I have a problem.</p>
