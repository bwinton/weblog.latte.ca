<p>Hey, check it out, I'm being a team player and doing one of the
activities on the <a href="http://24hourreadathon.com/">Read-a-thon
website</a>. (Mostly I'm having too much fun reading to want to
do anything else!)</p>
<p>It's a survey:</p>
<p><strong>1. What are you reading right now?</strong> I'm in the middle of 
<em>Raincloud</em> by Richard S. Todd.</p>
<p><strong>2. How many books have you read so far?</strong> One whole book, and two half-books.
Well, two whole books if you count <em>Oh, The Places You'll Go</em> which
I read out loud to my five-year-old.</p>
<p><strong>3. What book are you most looking forward to for the second 
half of the Read-a-thon?</strong> I'm looking forward to <em>Wanting Mor</em> by 
Rukhsana Khan, mainly because it's a YA so I hope it will go down
nice and smooth. I hope it's not too harrowing. I was going to
read <em>Heat</em> by George Monbiot but I fear I have squandered my
most wide-awake hours on easier books.  I don't think I have the
brain power to get through it.</p>
<p><strong>4. Did you have to make any special arrangements to free up your whole 
day?</strong> All I had to do was plan ahead for lunch (which we usually improvise
on Saturdays) and get my husband to order in dinner. He's been great
at keeping everything running smoothly in my (functional) absence.</p>
<p><strong>5. Have you had many interruptions? How did you deal with those?</strong>
Not particularly, apart from that I live with a seven-year-old and
a five-year-old. Seven was away at a friend's most of the day, and
Five has been very agreeable. I did take a break this afternoon to
set up a science-y activity for her to do, but then she was quietly
engaged for about an hour. </p>
<p>I did have short conversations with a couple of people this morning.</p>
<p><strong>6. What surprises you most about the Read-a-thon, so far?</strong> How not
at all tired I am of reading. I'm tired, but not of reading, just of,
you know, being awake.</p>
<p><strong>7. Do you have any suggestions for how to improve the Read-a-thon 
next year?</strong> For me, or in general? For me, I might put together a pile
of less-challenging or more exciting books. I didn't plan ahead enough to collect
a set of books I was really excited to read. As it is I'm 
cleaning up a few books from my TBR pile which have been hanging 
around for a while, so that's valuable, but it would be easier
(especially tonight as I get tireder) to have books I was really
thrilled about reading.</p>
<p>In general, I'm pretty happy with how it's being run. It's a nice
low-key event.</p>
<p><strong>8. What would you do differently, as a Reader or a Cheerleader, 
if you were to do this again next year?</strong> Oh hey, I already answered
that because I didn't look at all the questions on the test before
starting. :)</p>
<p><strong>9. Are you getting tired yet?</strong> A little bit. I'm actually less tired
than I usually am at this time of day, probably because I usually do
more strenuous things than sit around reading all day. I expect I will
run into trouble in an hour or so. I might even have coffee. (I never
have coffee!)</p>
<p><strong>10. Do you have any tips for other Readers or Cheerleaders, 
something you think is working well for you that others may not 
have discovered?</strong> Nope, unless having an awesome supportive family
counts as a tip! </p>
<p>Actually I've really liked the fact that I'm raising money
for charity at the same time (here's 
<a href="http://www.firstgiving.com/amyrhoda">my page</a> – it 
was very easy to set up). I love reading but I would feel so guilty
slacking off on all my usual responsibilities if I hadn't found a
way to help benefit others with the read-a-thon.</p>
