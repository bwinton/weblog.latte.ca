<p>The other day I was talking to the head librarian at the 
library, about the options for someone who wanted to be 
a librarian when she grew up.  I've been toying with 
taking a one-year library technician course at a local
college, but the website says something like, "With
this diploma you can find work at public libraries 
outside Toronto."  But not inside Toronto.  If I want
to work at the TPL I have to either get a Masters or
work my way up the ladder for decades.  Well heck.  If I go into library work,
do I want to work at a public library or do I want to
work for a law firm or a corporation?  I'd like to at
least keep the option of public library work open.  We 
talked about the Masters of Information Studies at U of T, which
would be great if I can get in, apart from being pretty
expensive.</p>
<p>So I went to the U of T website where I found this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Applicants who graduated five or more years ago but 
without achieving sufficiently high standing for admission 
to the School may be considered for admission if, since 
graduation, they have done significant, intellectual 
work and/or made a significant professional 
contribution which can be considered equivalent to a 
higher academic standing. This contribution and its 
impact on the profession must be detailed and 
documented (e.g., publications, research, professional 
advancement, development of new skills, responsibility, 
etc.) and presented as part of the application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven't actually checked to see whether my BMath 
marks are sufficiently high, but since they are best described 
as dismal I can only assume they won't be. I spent 
ten years in a field which I hated and so
I wasn't exactly a stellar employee, and then I stayed 
home to take care of my children, and last I checked 
they don't actually give out awards for that.  So 
maybe, just maybe they will let me into this program
with a lot of sweet talking, more likely I will have to
take a few undergrad courses (which would be fine) or
worst case, I would have to take a whole new undergrad
degree.  Which will take years and cost a billion dollars
which I don't really have because we're in debt and we
haven't saved a penny for the girls' educations.</p>
<p>If I could give a high school graduate one piece of advice,
it would be to take an undergrad program that is easy enough
for you to graduate with good marks in, because not having a four-year
degree with good marks closes off so many career options.
I wish I had known, I would have switched into English like 
I thought about doing in 1A.  That is my one Erica Strange-style
regret.  I should have listened to my gut and not
stayed in math to try and impress the boys.  You
have one opportunity to be shiny and if you blow it, it's over.</p>
<p>That's not true.  I could start afresh and get a whole
new undergrad degree, and I guarantee I would kick ass
because I would choose something I'm passionate about 
(not math).  But man... the years, the money.  Am I just
making excuses?  Should I bite the bullet?  You hear all
the time about people who go back to school when their
kids are little, and work jobs at the same time!  Why can't
I be awesome like that?  I'm always looking for the easy
way.  Maybe if I want to do this properly, to live this
life as fully as I should, I shouldn't look for the easy
way.  Maybe the easy way will lead to regrets.  Maybe the
easy way will lead to a life of mediocrity distinguished
only by the nagging sense that I could have done better.</p>
<p>Or maybe I will make myself and my family miserable by spending 
too much time and money on a degree that won't actually fix
my life.  Maybe I should just get some tech job that I hate
and spend the money renovating the house.  Or try and get
a good job without getting a bunch more education.</p>
<p>So whatever.  Do I even want to be a librarian?  I have no 
idea.  I really want to do something useful and meaningful,
which sounds so idiotically idealistic and adolescent, but
I'm not speaking as an adolescent, I'm speaking as a mature
adult who sees what is going on in the world and who can't
tolerate the idea of being away from hearth and family simply
to earn money and further the ends of some CEO.  If I'm
going to work, I want the work to be worth doing.</p>
<p>Anyway, the time has come when I have to make a decision. 
Cordelia is going to start kindergarten this year, and 
in 2011 she'll be in grade one.  I need to start thinking
about what I'm going to do so I can take some
evening courses, or think about how to make money in the
meantime.  Can I even justify any further education when
we're so in debt?  Or does it make more sense to get me
all educated up so I can earn more sooner?</p>
<p>I just don't know.  I'm a muddled, confused mess and all
these questions are ricocheting around my head all the time
making me frustrated and exhausted.  I hate not having 
a direction, and I
have never been as directionless as I am now.  The only
thing I'm sure of is that I need to think about what I
like to do and what I'm good at, and make an appointment
with a career counsellor to figure out what the hell I
am going to do when I grow up.  Because I'm really ready
to grow up now.</p>
