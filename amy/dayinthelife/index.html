(Delphine is almost five and Cordelia is two and a half and a month.)
</p>
<p>
It's 8:03 in the morning, and the girls are out on the deck.
It's about 10 degrees outside so they both have on sweaters,
and Cordelia has on mismatched wellies.  They are lounging
on the lounge chairs (the "relaxing" chairs) and playing
"Ah ah ah!" with a crow.  The crow says "Ah ah ah!" and
they say "Ah ah ah!" back.  Blake stood at Delphine's
window (which overlooks the deck) and said "Ah ah ah!"
and Cordelia started giggling.
</p>
<p>
Delphine loves to go outside every morning right after
breakfast, now that it has warmed up (the weather, not
breakfast).  She has explored
every one of the thousand square feet back there, and
she keeps track of what is growing for me.  Right now
the fiddleheads are coming up, and it's all I can do
to stop her from picking them all to eat.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia is at that stage where she 
overgeneralizes grammatical rules, so she "holded"
my hand or she "moveded" back.  (I'm not sure what
that double-suffix thing is about, but it's pretty
cute, in a Gollum-esque way.)  Anyway, that's
cute enough but Delphine has started doing it too,
which is awesome.  I like that she's learning things
from her sister, even if those things are wrong.
I'm sure they'll get sorted out sooner or later.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
8:17 am: Cordelia is sitting at the dining table
drawing with crayons.  She says "I'm drawin' a
hyclops!  The hyclops goin' to have hair..."
And she talks herself through the whole picture.
She likes drawing cyclopses because she's 
still at the stage where her drawings are mostly
circles and lines.  Circle, circle inside, 
two lines sticking out; ta-da!  Hyclops! 
</p>
<p>
Delphine is making pictures of all different houses.
She drew a condo, and a boathouse, and the roof of
a house, and a round house, and just a regular house.
</p>
<p>
This morning Delphine told me she had a bad
dream, but she changed it to be a good dream.  There
were monsters, and she had writing on her skin 
which told the monsters there was something inside
her, but she told the monsters that the stuff 
inside was stuff they didn't like, muscles and
bones, not something good like money and treasure.
Then she flew away, and the monsters couldn't fly.
She triumphs in her dreams!
</p>
<p>
It must have been a good night for bad dreams, because
Cordelia woke up twice with bad dreams, too.  Maybe
Delphine can teach her how to make her bad dreams
go better.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
It's 2:42 pm which means I should go and wake up 
Cordelia so we can go pick up Delphine.  Cordelia
has only been asleep for about an hour; I put her
down a little later than usual because there was
a guy here aerating our lawn and I had to pay him.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, this morning we went to the library to pick
up the thousands of books Blake and I had on hold,
and to get some books for the girls.  The girls got
another Alfie book by Shirley Hughes, and a few more
picture books.  I got a couple for Delphine from the
"Advanced Picture Books" shelf.  I must also remember
to order a new chapter book for her; we just finished
"'B' is for Betsy" by Carolyn Haywood.  We read
a couple of books while we were there; Delphine picked
out a book about a farmer, but she was very disappointed
when it turned out to be just a counting book.  She
is getting too old for probably about half of
the books in the picture book section of the library.
I think we might have to switch to a bigger library,
but I don't want to; I love this library and it's so
handy.
</p>
<p>
After the library we went to the toy store to get 
something for Ursa, who is turning 5 this weekend.
The girls were supposed to help me pick something
out, but they got distracted by the train set.
There was a little boy playing with the trains too,
and they did 'dinosaurs knock over the trains'
and 'look out, sheep, don't get hit by a train!'
and all kinds of other train/plastic animal hybrid
games.  I finally got them to help my pick some 
little things out, and we headed home.
</p>
<p>
Lunch was peanut butter and Marmite on leftover 
buns (I forgot to make bread <em>again</em>).  I
made Delphine a snack of oatmeal cookies and prunes
(no, she's not constipated, she just really likes
prunes) and we were off to school.  After I dropped
her off, Cordelia and I headed home, the lawn aerator
guy was here, and that's the end of that story, mostly.
After he was done I overseeded the lawn and seeded the
border we are converting to lawn.  I know, it's madness.
I need to come up with something better to do with my 
backyard, but
in the meantime grass seed is cheap.
</p>
<p>
Now I'm going to wake up Cordelia and get her something
to nibble on while we go back to the school to pick up
her big sister.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
Cordelia had a couple of oatmeal cookies to nibble on,
and I put her in the big double stroller to go pick up
Delphine. Usually we take a smaller stroller, but 
Delphine stubbed her toe really badly in the morning
so I thought she might need a ride home.
</p>
<p>
After school, Delphine stopped and played with her
friends for ages, as usual.  School is out at 3:15
but we're lucky if we get home before 4:15.  As usual, they
started off playing in the school play structure, 
sliding, jumping on the wobbly bridge, and, 
increasingly, climbing the various climby bits –
ladders, ropes, tires, and so on.  Then they moved on
to playing right at the far end of the playing field,
apparently in the dirt.  I think they like it over
there because they're so far away from their Mums
and grandmothers and so on.  Finally we Mums got 
them moving by promising a few minutes of play
on "Big Hill", the sloped lawn at the front of
the school.  (Obviously Delphine's 
toe was no longer bothering her.)  We finally
managed to leave with only some of the usual
hysterics, and came home to a dinner of pancakes
and bacon and mango and fried tomato.  Sometimes
I like to have breakfast for supper, just for 
fun.
</p>
<p>
We skipped bathtime in favour of
reading some books, and then it was into pajamas
and into bed by 7:15.  I make that sound easy,
but often there is some debate as to whether
and when it is necessary to put on pajamas,
brush teeth, tidy bedrooms or go to bed.  Usually
we all agree on reading a book or two, though.
</p>
<p>
Blake got home, as usual, sometime in the middle
of bedtime and joined in the mess of brushing
and reading and fighting.  After the Smalls were in
bed we Bigs took the laundry off the line and folded
it, cleaned the kitchen, Blake had his supper, 
we watched a couple of <em>Daily Shows</em> and
went to bed.
</p>
<p>
And that's a day in the life.
