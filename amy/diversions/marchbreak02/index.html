<p>March break has been great so far but I keep thinking we've done
more than just two days of it.  We've crammed in a lot of excitement
already, so hopefully we didn't peak too soon.</p>
<p>Monday morning we got up nice and slow, and then Delphine and
I did some jobs around the house; we sorted and put away all
the girls' laundry, we baked cookies from a mix she got in a
party loot bag, and Cordelia joined us in cleaning the kitchen
floor, which we did with two buckets of soapy water and a lot
of cloths.  Cordelia mostly splashed around but Delphine really
helped.  She was very agreeable company all morning.</p>
<p>After lunch Delphine went on a bike ride with Blake, and I put
Cordelia down for a nap and then lay down on the couch myself.
I read some of the Globe, then fell asleep and woke up in time for 
Cordelia to wake up and Blake and Delphine to get home.  I
really should have cleaned the kitchen at some point, but
instead Blake suggested we watch <em>The Sound of Music</em>.  So I
popped some popcorn and the girls and I snuggled on the couch
for their second movie ever.</p>
<p>Delphine loved it.   She loved the songs, most of which she
already knew, she loved the children, she loved the story.  She
even got into the romance, which surprised me.</p>
<p>She was really scared by the Captain at
the beginning; she was petrified that the children were going
to get into trouble all the time.  She really doesn't like
stern people, and she's petrified of authority figures, of
getting in trouble, of doing the wrong thing, and of displeasing
authorities.  She gets it from me, and I'm not sure what to
do about it.  Anything? But we talked to her and got her thinking about
whether all rules are worth following, and about whether getting
into trouble is really the worst thing that can happen.  We're
so subversive.</p>
<p>Oh, and she was scared of the Nazis at the end.  (Or the Nasties,
as she called them at first.)  I figure the sooner you learn that
Nazis are scary the better.</p>
<p>Cordelia was a little bit scared of the things Delphine was scared
of, and towards the end of the show she just got bored and started
kicking people.</p>
<p>After the movie, which as it turns out is really really long, I was
all logey and out-of-sorts, which was bad because it was 6:30.
Dinner is supposedly at 6:00, and choir is actually at 7:30, so 
I had -30 minutes to get some food on the table and 30 minutes
to eat and leave to get to choir on time.  I nuked 
a bunch of leftovers (which was, as it turns out, actually the 
plan for dinner), ate, got out the door (with some uncharacteristic
leg-hanging and bawling from Cordelia) and was only about five minutes
late to choir, although out of breath.</p>
<p>Choir was only half-full and I got all cocky and sat off by myself.
I was soon humbled by the realization that I don't know the piece
half as well as I thought I did; without all those voices around me
I missed a few entries and ballsed up a few intervals that I would
have sworn I knew.  Choral singing can make a person really lazy.</p>
<p>The piece we're doing has some really (really really) high notes
and I was feeling very unsure as to how well I was singing them.  Sometimes 
something sounds great in your head but awful outside,
and they're such high, loud, conspicuous notes (the ones in the
sixth movement, for those playing along at home (Dave)) that I
really didn't want to be fucking them up inadvertently.  So I
sucked up my courage to ask the conductor how I was doing. I hoped
he would say I was doing okay but I steeled myself to be cool if
he had a problem, like if I was too loud or flat or something.  I 
know logically that you can only improve by accepting negative
feedback and working on it, but like Delphine I like to be perfect
at things right away because I hate criticism.  </p>
<p>The good news is that my high notes are fine, so now all
I have to work on is the whole rest of the piece.  Sigh.  But I
was pleased with myself for having the nerve to ask about it
rather than make myself miserable second-guessing my high notes for 
the rest of the season. Now I can belt them out with great
confidence!</p>
<p>I came home all fidgety and still out-of-sorts, happy because of
the good feedback but unhappy about the number of mistakes I made,
tired but too wired to go to bed.  I read too many chapters of
<em>Notes from a Small Island</em> by Bill Bryson, and finally fell asleep.</p>
<p>This morning Delphine had a playdate at a friend's house - a really
sweet, vivacious Grade One girl who was in Delphine's kindergarten
class last year.  They don't get together very often now, but they
seem to maintain an affection for one another. So Delphine stayed
there for lunch while Cordelia and I entertained a friend of mine
and her baby. This is a new friend, one of the many lovely and 
clever and interesting people I've met in the last year or two.
She admired my kitchen.  I always appreciate people who admire my
kitchen.</p>
<p>After our company left I managed to stuff some food into Cordelia
and put her down for a nap before Delphine was returned home
after her playdate. Delphine watched some TV while I cleaned
the kitchen and did laundry. (Cleaning the kitchen and doing
laundry seems to be more-or-less my default state.)</p>
<p>At 1:30 I roused Cordelia and we all headed over to the park
to meet Auntie Morgan.  The girls are thrilled to rediscover the
park and explore all their new abilities, developed unwittingly
over the winter.  Cordelia loves to go down the big slides which
scared her last fall, and Delphine can now successfully pump on 
the swings (although she prefers not to).</p>
<p>After an hour or so at the park Cordelia declared she had to go
pee, so we walked over to my friend Tanya's house to use their 
facilities.  (It's important to cultivate friends who live near 
the park.) When they heard we were at the park they thought it 
was such a sovereign idea that they decided to join us, and 
then we bumped into still more friends, and then the ice cream 
truck hove into view!  The park is truly a wonderland of friends 
and unexpected frozen dairy treats.</p>
<p>I was the only person there with money, so I bought four little
ice cream cones for various little people.  I think I got shortchanged 
but getting that much
happiness for under a ten-spot is still a pretty good deal.  Plus
I got to finish Delphine's ice cream.  ("Mama, can you eat this
ice cream for me?  But don't eat the cone.")  </p>
<p>When it was time to leave the park there was some confusion: Delphine
wanted to go pee but didn't want to go home, so we all walked over
to Tanya's place to use her bathroom again. I knew, of course, that
there was no chance that Delphine would just pee and leave - she
and Ursa got to playing and Tanya and I were similarly reluctant
to part company.  I tried to coax Tanya to come to my place for burgers
and hot dogs, but she has been sick and was tired, and she had 
plans to meet her husband, but then it would be easier to come to 
my place than go out, and burgers are yummy, and the girls are having 
such a nice time... we dithered, we weighed options, we wasted a great 
deal of time.  I think Tanya was just too tired to make a decision.</p>
<p>Then I suggested a sleepover and Tanya visibly brightened.  She
asked Ursa if she would like to go for a sleepover at Delphine's
place, and the girls acted as if I had just offered them pink
flying ponies with sparkly tails. So that was a go.  The whole lot
of us walked back to our place (desperately slowly, with several
wipeouts) where I ended up making KD (it was
too late to do burgers and anyway Tanya wasn't staying for dinner).
Everyone ate a bunch of KD and edamame, and Tanya and I had tea.  </p>
<p>And Tanya gave me a wonderful gift!  She's a painter and she painted
me a picture of the red Marmoleum floor that I originally wanted
(with some broken eggs on it). It's fantastic and I need to figure out
where to put it. And which way is up.  (Since it's a picture of the
floor, any way could be up. I get to decide!)</p>
<p>The girls finally got to bed after far too much foolishness, although
they were still awake at 8:40.  Hopefully this means that they will
sleep in.  (Hah.)</p>
