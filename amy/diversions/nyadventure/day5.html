<p>Friday was our last day in New York.  (I cleverly planned our trip to provide
a weekend at home before the trip and one after. Unfortunately as it turns out,
weekends in New York are on the same days as weekends in Toronto, and so
Sascha and Leontine and Nina could not hang out with us during the 
day. Instead, they were kind enough to spend two evenings with us and completely
annihilate Nina's bedtime two school nights in a row. If that isn't love
I don't know what is.)</p>
<p>Anyway, Friday was our last day. We were flying out from Newark at
two, so we had enough time to do a thing before leaving. The thing we
did was brunch at M. Wells (<em>Magasin Wells</em>), a little hipster
diner a couple of subway stops away from the hotel. The place didn't open
until 10, so we had a donughnut for first breakfast while we packed, and
then walked over. </p>
<p>It wasn't a nice walk — we walked under an elevated train for
some of the way, and it was through a kind of industrial-ish area. Still,
the sun was bright and warm, and it was interesting. Delphine picked up
a lot of beer bottle caps for her collection.</p>
<p>M. Wells is a super-cool place with a somewhat convoluted menu.
Brunch-y things were mixed up with lunch-y things, there were dishes
with brains in them, there was clear evidence that they could make
bacon and eggs and pancakes, but no bacon and eggs and pancakes on the
menu, because bacon and eggs and pancakes are not hip. (I had expected
something more diner-ish so I was a little taken aback by the menu.)</p>
<p>Anyway, Blake had tortilla Española, Delphine had a scone with apple
butter, and Cordelia and I had buckwheat crêpes with maple syrup, which
was billed as "maple syrup <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploye">ploye</a>". It was delicious —
thin, heavy pancakes drenched in maple syrup. Everything else was good,
too.</p>
<p>We went back to the hotel to pick up our bags, then began the long trek to
Newark: N to Times Square, change to the 1 to 34th station, then a NJ Transit train to Newark Airport.  We were not particularly early, so I was all fretty,
but I liked the cute little shuttle train from the NJ Transit stop to the 
terminal at the airport. </p>
<p>We were flying Porter, and they were a helpful and friendly as their 
reputation suggests. The plane was small but comfortable, and the staff
were patient with the girls. It was a bit of a rocky ascent, probably because
it was a prop plane, but once we reached altitude it was a smooth ride.
We were back in Toronto in about an hour. Porter provides a shuttle bus
right to the Royal York, so the rest of our trip home was effortless.</p>
<p>We had been reluctant to come home: we felt like we could have stayed
for a few more days. I think that's the perfect way to end a trip. I might
even have suggested that we would go back some day.</p>
