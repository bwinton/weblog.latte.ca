<p>In order to go to the Write the Docs conference that I wrote about
in my last post, you might suppose, correctly, that I had to go to 
Portland, Oregon.
My last adventure was my trip to <a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/2011/0701/">Japan</a> in 2011, so I was ready to
get away.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to get from Toronto to Portland; I chose to 
go via Vancouver on Air Canada because I heard from Twitter that, while
Air Canada is bad, the American airlines are worse. 
As usual, I didn't have any trouble with Air Canada and arrived in Vancouver
only slightly cramped and squashed.</p>
<p>We flew into a storm on the way from Vancouver to Portland, and when we were
almost there the plane got hit by lightning. I wasn't terribly happy about that;
I couldn't think of a time I had heard about planes being hit by lightning and
it ending well. The pilot didn't seem bothered, though, and apart from some
turbulence and the people behind me panicking, we landed without a problem.</p>
<p>Portland was warm and moist and smelled wonderful. I got a ride to the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_deLuxe">Hotel
deLuxe</a> from an Internet friend, and we had a chance to gossip and talk to
her
little guy about Superman and the fact that he couldn't reach his bits of paper
with "S" on them.</p>
<p>The Hotel deLuxe was built in 1912 and recently restored with a 
vintage movie theme. It's a luxurious old-timey hotel like a smaller King Eddy.
My room had floor-to-ceiling velvet drapes, crystal deco-style light fixtures,
and white subway tile in the bathroom. The bed was furnished with thick, heavy
sheets and more pillows than I knew what to do with. (So, more than two.) 
There was
also a pillow menu, so you could order an even better pillow than
the umpteen already there, and a holy book menu so you could request any one of
about twelve holy books. I approve of the breaking of the Gideon hegemony.</p>
<p>After I got settled in I decided to go for a walk to wind down after travelling
all day. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powell%27s_Books">Powell's Book
Store</a> was nearby, labelled as an attraction on the hotel map, and open late,
so that was my destination. </p>
<p>The area around
the hotel was dead at that time of night; there are some offices, a church, a
theatre with nothing going on.
Obviously I wasn't familiar with the neighbourhood so I didn't know
how nervous to be, but there were a few women walking around and biking alone,
so I decided not to be nervous. After a couple of blocks I came to Burnside
Street, which was a little livelier.</p>
<p>Powells is astonishing. It's a multi-storey used book store which covers an
entire block; it's a shrine to books. I could have spent the whole weekend
there, but I managed to escape after about an hour and a half with only a few
books and a couple of gifts for the girls.</p>
<p>The next day was the conference, which I already talked about <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/work/writeTheDocs.html">over here</a>. I woke
up early (still being on EST, three hours earlier than local time), worked
out in the hotel's small-but-effective gym, then had a proper cooked breakfast
in the hotel restaurant. (I don't know why, but hotel breakfasts are the height
of luxury and self-indulgence to me.) </p>
<p>I walked to the conference site in plenty of time, so when I got there the
doors weren't open yet. There was a short line of grumpy-looking people waiting
to get in (and <a href="http://howtowriteeverything.com/marcia-riefer-johnston-bio/">one
person</a> who looked pleased to be there). I was happy and well-rested so I
didn't want to stand in a grumpy line, but I wasn't feeling outgoing enough to
talk to the one happy person, so I went for a walk around the block instead.</p>
<p>By the time I got back the doors to the Mission Theater were open. It's
another old building (Portland doesn't seem to have Toronto's love
of knocking old buildings down): a <a href="http://www.mcmenamins.com/210-mission-theater-home">theatre</a> with a balcony and a bar. </p>
<p>As I said in the other post, the conference was great. We were served lunch and
there was an open bar (!). The line for lunch was really long, so to pass the
time I had a beer; the first day I asked for something "not too bitter"
(because I know Americans love really bitter ales); the drink the bartender
served me was delicious and indeed not too bitter, so I asked what it was: a
Nebraska Bitter. Good thing I let him choose.</p>
<p>I took a break from the conference and walked down a few blocks to get
a coffee from Barista â€” some of the people at the conference
suggested it as the best local coffee place. (It was delicious and, after
three days I'm officially spoiled for non-awesome coffee.) I also 
stumbled on <a href="http://www.oblationpapers.com/">Oblation Papers</a>,
a paper and print shop with beautiful, quirky handmade cards. Like so
many places in Portland, the store is just the front desk for a tiny
factory â€” they actually make the paper right on site. There's also
a budgie.</p>
<p>I really like Portland. I don't really understand how the economy of Portland
works because there seem to be lots of businesses which employ people
to make things by hand, and sell the things for reasonable price. You can
get vegan food everywhere, and wherever you can buy coffee, you can also
buy beer. </p>
<p>Monday night the conference organizers had some events planned; a night at a <a href="http://groundkontrol.com/">video game arcade</a> (with infinite
quarters), and a couple of informal gatherings nearby, at a beer place and a
coffee place. The video game arcade had dozens, if not hundreds, of video games
and pinball games, but nothing that appealed to me (unsurprisingly â€” I
have never liked video games).  They had DDR but no-one was playing. I ended up
going around the corner to the coffee place â€” not only coffee, but beer
and computers you could rent time on â€” but there was no-one from the
conference there. I was tired and hungry anyway, so I had a plate of nachos,
read Twitter and went back to the hotel.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I tried World Cup Coffee, which was better than Starbucks but not as
good as good Portland coffee (told you I'm spoiled). They were experiencing a
small fire in one of their coffee roaster, but they managed to make me a coffee
anyway.</p>
<p>Wednesday morning I woke up even earlier, packed, and had
another fancy hotel breakfast.
Then I caught the Max train (just around the corner from the hotel) and rode
all the way to the airport without a single transfer. <em>So awesome!</em> I
wish I lived in a non-world-class city that had decent transit to the
airport.</p>
<p>I entirely failed to get any good gifts for my cat-sitters, so I hoped I would
be able to get something at the airport.  I was lucky; turns out the Portland
airport has <em>awesome</em> retail, including a store called <a href="http://www.madeinoregon.com/">Made in Oregon</a> which has a great
selection of interesting, actually-local food and gifts. I got hazelnuts, tea,
chocolate and saltwater taffy for the folks back home.</p>
