<li>
<p><strong>I was baptized into the Anglican church when I was ten.</strong>
Yeah.  Old enough to know better.  I'm still not really sure
why I did it; I don't think I really believed in God even
back then.  I was not the most thoughtful kid, and I think
I figured that it was some kind of protracted metaphor or
something.  Or maybe I did believe in God back then.  I
remember praying when I was little, six or seven.  I used
to pray to Jesus that I would have a new toy when I got home
from school.  Yeah, I was a horrible little materialist too.
I know I was thoroughly atheist by high school, I'm just
not sure when and why I changed my mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I once perpetrated a horribly executed breakup.</strong> I was nineteen
and I broke up with the one boyfriend I had before I 
met Blake.  I didn't know why I wanted to break up with him -
still not very thoughtful by then - 
I just knew it wasn't going to work and I wanted out. So I 
broke up with him, but of course since <em>I</em> didn't know why I
wanted out, I couldn't tell <em>him</em> why, which must have been very 
unsatisfying. On top of that, I felt so guilty about making
the guy miserable that I kind of told him we might get
back together.  We weren't going to get back together, and I
must have realised that, but I was too much of a coward
to make a clean break so I strung the poor kid along for a
couple of months.  Oh, did I mention we were still having
sex? Yeah, that was all part of the "let him down easy"
initiative.  I don't think the guy knew it was really over until
he realized I was going out with Blake.  And by "going out
with", I mean... well, you know what I mean.</p>
<p>But the ex consoled himself with a fresh new 
seventeen-year-old, so I don't feel too bad.  I think they're
still together!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I have 
<a href="http://www.badgut.com/index.php?contentFile=ibs&amp;title=Irritable%20Bowel%20Syndrome">IBS</a>.</strong>  (I love that domain name.)
I don't really talk about it because
it's not very interesting and it seems like TMI.  Although
apparently it affects between 15% and 30% of the population,
and yet I don't know anyone else who admits to having it.
So maybe it's time to start talking about it, because I 
know I feel like I'm the only person in the world with this
stupid, embarrassing problem.</p>
<p>Hm, I just realized I'm exaggerating.  I know two other people
with various awkward bowel problems, and a third person has told
me she has IBS.  So maybe I'm not so alone.  Still.  Feels that
way sometimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I have a thing for (tall) men with beards.</strong> Big, full beards, not
long, Gandalf beards.  Yeah, I know it's
weird and runs contrary to the current (like, the last century)
fashion but there it is.  It might have started with an
early love for 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Durrell">Gerald Durrell</a>
Or maybe it's just a Santa Claus thing.  The irony is
Blake's never going to be able to grow a decent beard. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When I was eleven I started to learn flute, and then
clarinet, and quit them both.</strong> I quit because I was not
instantly successful and I didn't yet realize that most 
things worth doing are difficult and annoying at 
first.  I was the classic over-praised child; I was so
keen to maintain my reputation as "smart" and "capable" that
the moment I wasn't good at something I quit. I also doubted
my ability to succeed - I honestly thought that if something
was hard at first I would never get better at it.  I don't
know how I so colossally failed to get the concept
of a "learning curve" for so many years.  Trying not to
let that happen to my kids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I have a million cousins.</strong>  Well, not a million, but
plenty, especially considering I only have one aunt and one
uncle.  My aunt Delphine, my mother's sister, had one daughter who
had two kids, so that's one cousin and two cousins once 
removed.</p>
<p>My uncle Michael, on my father's side, was a little more fecund.
He has four children (so five cousins total).  Cousin Martin has
four children, Bernard has three children, Amanda and Bridget
have two each for a total of thirteen cousins once removed.
Bernard's daughter Giorgina has a baby now, so I have a 
cousin twice removed as well.  That makes nineteen cousins
altogether.</p>
<p>I guess that isn't that many cousins - people from larger
families have dozens of cousins.  But to someone who
grew up without any significant contact with extended
family, it seems like a lot.  It seems weird to have this
connection with such a big group of people.</p>
<p>I don't hear much from my extended family, at 
least on my dad's side, 
probably because they already have eleven cousins and 
four aunts and uncles to deal with.  I'm sure they're not 
in the market for yet another family member.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I lived in at least ten different houses before I went to
university at seventeen.</strong>  Why?  No good reason.  My parents
(my dad, really) just felt the need to move a lot.  I think
my childhood would have been better if we hadn't have moved
so much, but there were benefits, too: I have lived in three
different countries, I have experienced what it is to be
an outsider (again, and again, and again). I am extremely
adept at finding people I like and making friends.   I'm good
at finding my way around new places and I can feel comfortable
just about anywhere.</p>
<p>The moving madness didn't stop when I went to university, of course.
I was in co-op, which meant another move every four months.
Waterloo, Ottawa, Waterloo, Mississauga, Toronto, Waterloo.
But since then (apart from a four month trip to Europe) I have
lived within two kilometers of Yonge and Davisville, and here
I intend to stay until the girls go off to <em>their</em> universities.
It's nice to finally put down some roots.</p>
