<p>I used to have a blog here, but lately I've been busy with
this paying job thing and haven't been blogging much. I have
about eighteen million books to blog about, and everything
else. This is going to be the everything else post.</p>
<h5>Delphine</h5>
<p>Delphine is nearly seven and she's become all happy and patient and
agreeable. Well, not <em>all</em>, but more than before. She sometimes
doesn't respond when Cordelia tries to fight with her; she sometimes goes
along with me when I ask her to do stuff she doesn't want to;
she is usually happy after school and she seldom complains about
her day. She's no Pollyanna, but she's not quite as emo and 
gloomy as she has been through most of the last year.</p>
<p>Delphine had her first piano lesson last Saturday. Piano lessons
now are so much cooler than when I started playing: instead of
starting with "this is a staff and this is a quarter note" it
starts with "these are your fingers and this is the keyboard"
and you plunk away, and notation is introduced as needed and no
sooner. </p>
<p>So Delphine loves piano. She couldn't wait to get home to practice,
and she has practiced every day this week.</p>
<h5>Cordelia</h5>
<p>Cordelia is still happy, sweet Cordelia. She tells me she loves me 
eighteen million times a day and she does little dances. She loves her
friends, too—she and Anna won't go into the kindergarten 
playground without the other.</p>
<p>I wonder, sometimes, if Cordelia's always going to be the sweet, frivolous
contrast to Delphine's darker personality. No, that's not quite right.
What I wonder is how Cordelia's bubbliness will make the transition
to adulthood. Where is she going to get that gravity that surely
adulthood demands?</p>
<p>For now it seems like along with gloominess, Delphine
also has a lock on scepticism, bookishness, and intellectualism 
(inasmuch as a six-year-old can be intellectual). Cordelia's only
"things" are that she runs really fast (and a lot) and sings
well. I guess I worry that Delphine's going to be "the clever
one", leaving some other identity for Cordelia. I suppose even if
she isn't "the clever one" she'll still be clever and she can
always leverage that in whatever she ends up doing with herself.</p>
<p>Anyway, there's nothing so sure as that they'll be what they'll
be and I have much less control over what they'll be than I'd
like to think.</p>
<h5>Me</h5>
<p>As for me, I have got myself a paying job. I'm copyediting and
laying out a non-fiction book for self-publishing. A while
ago I said that I didn't think copyediting would be a great
job for me because it's so picky-picky; as it turns out it's
a lot more fun than I thought it would be. I do love to proofread
things, and even the totally anal stuff is kind of cool. I like
knowing what kind of dash to use (even if I don't always bother
to use the right one) and whether "BCE" has periods or not. And
the meticulousness you need to employ to keep track of the 
style decisions you've made is right up my list-making alley.</p>
<p>I do need to reread Strunk and White, and some other writing books,
just to clarify what makes good writing good, and I feel like
I should put my hands on some style guides. (I wonder if people buy
those on paper or just, I dunno, subscribe to them online or something.)</p>
<p>This working gig is going to have to get a lot more real in
September. I signed Cordelia up for daycare when she was just over a
year old, and as it turns out she got in. She starts in September
at the daycare at the school. I won't have Delphine in daycare
("It's not FAIR!") but I will send her to school with a lunch, so
my work day will be from 9:00 until 3:00. My plan, such that it is,
is to work a twenty-hour week, leaving me ten hours a week for such
frivolity as housework, exercise, reading and getting my nails done.
Maybe I'll skip the nails and read more.</p>
<p>I'm reading a rather intense (but very useful) book about 
starting a home-based
writing business. The author is quite intent on my making a business
plan, planning further education, budgeting, marketing, and all
that sensible, grown-up stuff. I almost feel like I can't waste
my time doing that stuff when I could be doing billable work—kind
of like the kid who runs his bike all the way to school because he
doesn't have time to get on. I'm also resisting doing all that
business stuff because somehow I can't take myself that seriously
as a professional freelance writer and copyeditor. Clearly I'm 
going to have to get over that, but fortunately I have a few months
to do it.</p>
