I am having some kind of stupid birthday crisis.  As I was
loading the dishwasher this evening I was ruminating on how
aggravating it sometimes is to have to share every single
little bit of your life with someone else.  I had just answered
the door to a charming young lady wanting me to sponsor a 
child, and I said no because I know Blake doesn't want to 
donate money to charities until we're out of debt.  If it
was just up to me I would probably give a little bit every
month regardless of debt; it's not like malaria is going
to take a break while we pay off our reno.  After bidding 
the charity girl good luck I went back to loading the 
dishwasher, which I have to do Blake's way because Blake
unloads.  Fair enough, and all this is perfectly reasonable
—I am by no means faulting Blake here, I couldn't ask
for a better husband.  It just gets a little tired 
constantly having to consider someone else, or in my
case three someone-elses.
</p>
<p>
After I finished the dishwasher I followed a link from my
<a href="http://dagbrown.livejournal.com/">brother's blog</a>
to <a href="http://mccorpsecorpse.livejournal.com/">this dude's
blog</a> to <a href="http://tvtropes.org/">TV Tropes</a> where
I spent an enjoyable hour or more reading about <em>Buffy</em>
and <em>Firefly</em> and <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> (though
perhaps I should not have read those spoilers), and
I really miss good TV.  I miss watching thoughtful, 
well-written shows, and
I miss going to work the next day and discussing them with
smart people, either live or online (yes, I spent far too
much time discussing TV at work, and I guess I will have
to remove <em>that</em> admission from this space before
I look for another job).    I miss having the time and the
spare 
emotional and intellectual resources to dedicate to TV shows.
</p>
<p>
And somehow (there may be some hormones involved)
that particular nostalgia has snowballed
irrationally into missing the days when I had lots of time
to play on the Internet, when my life was spent in a shiny
air-conditioned condo on a busy street and I took a train
to work and played on computers all day.  Now suddenly
my life seems to be spent playing in the dirt with two
messy, demanding, noisy, emotional (why, oh why must they be
two and four at the same time!) little people who seem
to have no interest in discussing Marti Noxon's Season
Six intellectual breakdown, or whether there is any 
point in improving Internet security technology as long
as it is still possible to adhere a Post-It note with
your password written on it to the side of your monitor.
</p>
<p>
Oh, I miss grown-ups.  I miss them so much.  I miss
air conditioning.  I miss meetings.  I miss lists of 
things to do that don't involve zucchini.  I miss 
computers and filesystems and data and logical problems
and whiteboards and deadlines and lunch rooms and 
that idiotic conversation about where we should go
for lunch this week.  I miss being something other than
Mom ("mudder", she calls me) and homemaker.
</p>
<p>
Being Mom is something that will never change, but one
day it will involve less dirt and hopefully more conversations
about Marti Noxon.  (Or actually hopefully not, now that
I think about it.)  And one day I will go back to work
and they will probably have outlawed air conditioning by
then, but there will be computers and meetings and 
deadlines and I will soon refresh my hatred for all three
things.  Life is all about balance — you have to hate
lots of different things to be truly happy.
