<p><a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/everythingelse/thoseWomen.html">Back in
November</a> I talked about those women who do a million and one 
things—have a career, have a nice house, do charity work, volunteer
 at school—and how I'm going to be more like them. So far
it's going pretty well—I helped with a fundraiser at school,
I'm chair of a somewhat underachieving Eco-committee (part of the problem
being that whenever we think of something eco to do it turns out the
school is already doing it), and so far my children haven't starved
to death or sickened due to the filthy state of the house. One thing
did falter: I missed a few notes in
the Christmas concert because I wasn't at the dress rehearsal.
Lesson learned.</p>
<p>But I digress. The reason I bring this up is that I realized that
this ambition, to Do Lots of Things, is a subset of a bigger ambition
which I have just put into words: Be More Awesome.</p>
<p>As I have discussed before, I see myself as a veritable well of
unfulfilled potential. Sure, I have a rather lame math degree 
and two lovely children, but other people my age are running
for city councillor and writing books and,well, being awesome. I want
at least a little piece of that.</p>
<p>Let me digress again for a moment. The school is getting a second 
kindergarten playground, and the eco-committee wants it to be
a natural playground, one of those jobbies with logs and rocks
to play on instead of metal and plastic playstructures. Great idea, 
very eco. We (mostly I) came up with this idea ages ago, but I
wasn't sure where to start, who to talk to, how to broach the 
subject. So I didn't do anything.</p>
<p>And then last week I busted up my back (You know why? Because in
my last post I was all "I haven't hurt my back for over a year!"
Stupid.) and I was stuck on the couch all week. Rather than
be completely useless I did some research on natural playgrounds
and then I emailed the principal. I was all, "The eco-committee
is exploring the idea of a natural playground for the new 
kindergarten playground", and I went on to briefly describe a
natural playground, and explain why we (I) thought it would be
a good idea. I cc'd the vice-principal, our trustee, and the rest
of the committee, and hit send. </p>
<p>Three minutes later the 
trustee replied saying he would be happy to attend a meeting
about this proposal. Proposal! It was just an idea, a whim!
But by writing it down and sending it to some people,
it became a proposal. Thirty minutes later the 
principal responded with a five-paragraph email, cc'd
to about a billion more people, saying
that they had considered a natural playground, we should meet
soon and what was my thinking? We're meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>That's it. That's all it took: an idea, some Googling and a
judiciously cc'd email, and now we have a proposal and a meeting.
Obviously I'm going to have to prepare for the meeting, and there
will be other jobs coming down the pipeline, but all it took
to get the ball rolling was one email message.</p>
<p>What I have learned from this is that the path to awesomeness is
paved with tiny baby steps. This a truth neither profound 
nor abstruse, but it has been a long time coming to me.  I 
don't like to act on things unless I <em>know</em> how they're going to
turn out. And not just the first step, I like to know what's
going to happen four or five steps down the line. I like to think things
through and anticipate problems, and prepare for them.  This is a
wonderful trait if you're going camping, or taking two small people
downtown, or going on vacation, but it has its limits.
When I'm contemplating something complicated or new, or that
involves other people, I can can always think of nine or ten 
ways stuff could go horribly wrong. Thus, paralysis. Inaction. Failure
to be awesome.</p>
<p>A while ago I read a book called <em>Feel the Fear... And Do It 
Anyway</em> by Susan Jeffers and as you can see from 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/books/_2008/non-fiction.html#fear">my
discussion of it</a>, a) this blog post is well overdue and b) I am
a broken record. The good news is that I've taken the lessons I learned
from the book on board—the ideas that were new to me back in
2008 are a comfortable part of my daily coping repertoire now. So,
odd as it seems, these realizations, that I am scared to act if I don't
know I will succeed, and that it only takes a small step to start getting
things done, actually represent progress in my quest to be more awesome.</p>
