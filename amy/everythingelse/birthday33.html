<p>Yesterday was my thirty-third birthday.  Thirty-three
isn't a very interesting number, but it's one of the 
ones you have to get through on the way to ooooold.  </p>
<p>Blake's first present to me was to tell the girls
not to fight on my birthday.  If you know any 
two- and five-year-old sisters you will know how
long that lasted, but they did try.  For at least
an hour.  The next nice thing was that Blake let
me languish in bed while he went downstairs with
the girls and made tea and toast for me.  </p>
<p>After
breakfast we opened presents: Delphine got me a
strand of blue silk flowers and beads on a wire,
to decorate things with.  Cordelia got me a wire
and bead ladybug (and then broke it, but not 
fatally), and Blake got me a Moleskine notebook
for Writing Things Down In.  I loved everything.
Blake thought I might not like the girls' things
because of their tchotchke-like nature, but it's
surprising how much I completely adore them just
because my girlies picked them out.  I put the
blue flower garland on the banister and I put the
ladybug... well, I put it up high.  Hopefully I 
can put it somewhere else soon.</p>
<p>Despite it being my birthday we still had a million
errands to run (partly because we're going to 
Sask next week) but I had a nice time.  I spent
far too much money on clothes for Delphine (but
they were on sale!  And so cute!) and far too much
money on a present for my cousin.  We met up with
our friends Tanya and Ursa and continued
the tradition started last year of 
decorating cupcakes (which is to say,
burying them in as many sprinkles as they will hold).
Tanya and I got some very rare talking-together-like-grownups
time while the little ones slept and the five-year-olds
played with Playmobil.</p>
<p>After Tanya and Ursa left, Blake came home with 
KFC (my annual treat) and more presents!  A
beautiful <a href="http://www.basil.nl/assortiment_detail.asp?titel_var=2&amp;lang=3&amp;id=1864">Basil pannier</a> and the Torchwood
season one DVD!  He tried to get the latter 
signed, but I'm glad he didn't manage it
 because I would have
died of jealousy if he had met John Barrowman 
without me.  Well, maybe not died, quite.</p>
<p>Then more company; Kat came over and watched
our TV while the children were in bed, and we
went for a walk and had coffee.  We came home,
watched the first episode of Torchwood (I think
we may have converted Kat) and went to bed.  </p>
<p>All
in all, a super birthday, but my first full day
of being thirty-three was fabulous too.  Kat 
stayed over and we went to yoga together in the
morning.  Yoga was fun, as usual, but my hamstrings
are astonishingly tight and there were some postures
I couldn't even consider.  As usual, though, yoga
threw me some ego-boosting soft pitches:  I can balance!
I can ... well, mainly  I can balance! But there's a
lot of that in yoga!  The thing I like about yoga is 
that you might try a posture one minute that seems
completely impossible — you look at the person next to you
and wonder if perhaps there is some optical illusion
involved — but the very next posture is something you can
not only do, but do the "if you want a little more challenge"
variation!  Yoga wants you to feel good.</p>
<p>But the best thing of all was that today Delphine
learned how to ride a bike!  She went off with Blake
to practice riding in the school ground, and when they
got back she was riding all by herself.  I could
hardly believe my eyes!  This summer has been
great for her; she learned to climb a tree, she is
reading (not entire books but words and phrases), and
now riding a bike.  Wow!</p>
