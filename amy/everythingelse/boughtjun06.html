<strong>Neutrogena Fresh Cooling Body Mist Sunblock, SPF 30</strong>:
This is the stuff that is advertised that you don't have to rub it in, 
you just spray it on.  I hate using sunblock because of the sticky
goo factor, so I thought I would try this.  It's an old-school metal
aerosol can, which I don't usually buy because they're so hideous
for the environment.  It does indeed spray in a very fine mist;
so fine that about sixty percent of it flies into the air and 
never actually makes it to your skin.  Instead it goes all over
your bathroom, or worse, into your lungs.  Well, into your
nose; hopefully it doesn't actually make it to your lungs.  
It's so bad that I banish the children from the bathroom
and put on the extractor fan before I use it.
It also gets caught in all the little 
hairs, so I wonder how much of it is really reaching my 
skin.  And to add injury to insult, it gave me a painful,
itchy, flaking rash on my neck and shoulders.  Boo.  I am
using it up on my feet and the tattoo on my ankle, and I will
never buy it or any other aerosol sunblock again.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, I do like gel-based sunblocks for me and Blake
and sunblock in stick form for the girls.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 55</strong>,
for daily use as a facial moisturizer/sunblock.  I
bought this because of a recommendation years ago from Katie
on The Suspects.  I had been using the Oil of Olay face
lotion with sunblock, but that left me really greasy and shiny,
so I'd have to use powder on top.  Katie said this stuff left
a really nice finish, so I gave it a try and I love it.  It
goes on quite thick but really does dry to a powdery finish;
it doesn't feel heavy at all.  It's not meant as a moisturizer
so I don't know how it would be for someone who needs a lot of
moisture on their face, but for me it's perfect.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Anita Nursing Bra Model 5058</strong>.  The previous
gold standard for nursing bras was the 
<a href="http://www.anita.com/de/en/148,1,104,1480,39183__products-detail.htm">Anita 
5062</a>; two
separate bra boutiques sold me that bra and it is a 
fantastic bra.  However, last time I went to my bra
shop they showed me the 
<a href="http://www.anita.com/de/en/148,1,104,1480,41666__products-detail.htm">new
5058</a> and it's even better; it has more cotton so it's
less stretchy and provides, as they put it, more "lift".
More lift means my boobs are up where they're supposed 
to be and my midsection appears mysteriously thinner.
It also has pretty pink ribbon, which is good for morale.
Hooray!
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, the bra boutique where I spend all Blake's
hard-earned money always does a proper sizing, of course.
Guess what size I am?  Go on, guess. You'll never guess.
38G.  Seriously.  Who the hell is a 38G?  That's just
silly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Colgate Luminous Toothpaste, Paradise Fresh flavour</strong>.  
I bought this because I had a coupon, and I liked the shiny
box.  At first I loved it; it's purple, it has little sparkles,
it comes out in a star-shape, it tastes faintly fruity.  It's
like toothpaste for a princess, apart from that you have to
squeeze it out yourself.  But
now I am annoyed because it's too foamy — it foams up
to, like, three times the volume of regular toothpaste within
about ten seconds, so you have to spit right away and start
over.  And the "clean cap" technology is a joke, in that way
of something advertised to have a particular characteristic
which then turns out to have quite the opposite characteristic.  
I have never had a toothpaste tube so encrusted with dried
toothpaste goo in my life.  I will not buy this pretty purple toothpaste again.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<a href="http://www.princelionheart.com/site/t_str_6550.html">Prince 
Lionheart Stroller Connectors</a></strong>.  This
is probably one of the worse baby-related purchases I have
made.  The theory is sound, but in reality the width of two
umbrella strollers plus the generous six inches of the
connectors is too wide to go through a standard door, so 
you can only use this on wide sidewalks or maybe in big
suburban malls, provided you're not going to actually go
into a store.  Also (and this is my own stupidity)
you're not suppsed to use the umbrella strollers for children
heavier than 30 lbs, and Delphine is only one pound shy of 
that now, so we won't be able to use this for long anyway.
Fortunately the connectors were only $20, so no great loss.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Chi-chi Foo Foo Manicure</strong>.  I bought my friend
Kathryn a manicure at a fancy upscale nail spa for her birthday,
and a couple of weeks ago we finally got around to going.
As a birthday present it worked out well; the experience
was fun and we got a chance to hang out.  As a manicure,
though, it was dismal.  I am quite capable of 
putting lotion on my own hands and filing my own nails;
the part I have trouble with is getting the nail polish
on really perfectly and having it stay on.  Sadly that
seemed to be the part these manicurists had trouble with
too: the polish job was shoddy and started chipping off
within a couple of days.  Also both Kathryn and I had
dirt under our nails (we both work with children!) and
they didn't clean them.  On the one hand it's kind of
creepy and gross to ask someone to clean your nails for
you, but on the other hand can you really call it a
successful manicure when your client walks away with dirty
nails?
