<p>I got a great email newsletter from David Allen (of 
Getting Things Done fame) about taking stock of the
year's accomplishments and completions. He included a
list of categories to focus on, which I am going to
use to consider how 2009 was for me and what I'm going
to change in 2010.</p>
<h5>Physical</h5>
<p>After a c-section in 2003, another in 2005 and gallbladder
removal in 2007, 2009 was refreshingly free of major or 
minor surgery. I don't think I had a single episode of major
back pain, either, so maybe I have finally figured out how
to deal with that (mainly stretching, and strategic use of
ab muscles). I did some running after school started in September, 
but a bout of H1N1 in November sapped my motivation and I haven't 
run since.</p>
<p>I recently went to the doctor for my irregularly scheduled annual checkup
and everything checked up fine, but I have gained twenty pounds I 
wasn't entirely expecting. (I don't weigh myself at home so the 
pounds have lots of time to creep on between doctor visits.)
I will be addressing that situation in
the new year, along with everyone else in North America. I've 
been very self-indulgent with my eating habits lately—I
need to be more sensible about that, and I'm going to switch
from running to walking in the hopes that I can slip it into my
daily routine easier. I also think that doing yoga regularly
would cure most of my mechanical problems.</p>
<h5>Emotional</h5>
<p>I have to admit this has been a difficult year for me,
emotionally. I have been pretty unhappy about a couple of
things—doing all the housework myself, for 
example—and have felt almost entirely alone with
that unhappiness. Blake and
I are rubbish at confrontation so I tend to never try and
resolve problems with him. And they fester. As if that's not bad enough, I
don't have an extra-marital emotional support system to listen 
and offer support and suggestions. I used to have
my brother, then I had Sascha and my BF-as-it-turns-out-not-F
Janet. My brother and Sascha got lives and Janet dumped me,
and then Delphine was born, and I guess I haven't had any
real emo needs since then, until this year. This year has been
very emo but I've mainly dealt with it on my own, mostly in
the basement while folding laundry. That sucks. Kat is a 
good ear, but I can't drop everything and cry on the phone
to her whenever I'm unhappy. The laundry needs folding and
she has a job.</p>
<p>Obviously in 2010 I have to do that a little better. What
do I do? Make a new friend? One without a job or any children?
Get a therapist? Start a private journal? Go to a marriage
counsellor? I will have to figure something out.</p>
<h5>Mental</h5>
<p>Mentally I think I have held my ground this year. As I mentioned
in my book blog, this year hasn't been terrifically intellectually
rigorous, but I read a few thinky books and I've been keeping up
with my Walruses and New Scientists. I'm happy and excited with
my decision to pursue writing as a career. I love to read and
think and write, and if I can possibly make some kind of money at
it that would be awesome.</p>
<p>Next year, obviously, I have to kick the writing into  a
higher gear. It's very hard to get anything done in the two hours
that Cordelia is at school, so I have to figure out how to focus my efforts
in that time (less twitting and housework, more actual writing).
I have both girls on a list for daycare starting in September, but
of course paying for daycare demands that I earn an income. This
is more terrifying to me than perhaps it should be.</p>
<h5>Spiritual</h5>
<p>I think I'm in the same place spiritually that I was a year ago.
I don't think about it much.  I don't believe in the 
supernatural but I derive a feeling of
wonder from the immensity of the universe, from the magical
unlikeliness of our existence, from my children. I try to be
good. In 2010, more of the same.</p>
<h5>Financial</h5>
<p>We paid off our line of credit! Of course, Blake was on 
contract and he didn't pay taxes all year, so come April we may
be in debt again, but for now we are debt-free. Hopefully a year
from now we will be debt-free for sure.</p>
<h5>Family</h5>
<p>My family is awesome. The girls are going through an utterly
charming patch, and I'm happy with our parenting. I haven't
yelled in ages! Next year, I hope that will continue. Five
and seven are both supposed to be pretty charming ages, so that
looks good.</p>
<p>Further afield, I would like to be closer to my brother. He
just moved in with a girl who I know next to nothing about,
and I have no idea what's going on with him generally. I should
also call my mother more often. So should you, probably.</p>
<h5>Community Service</h5>
<p>Before this year I wouldn't have had a lot to say in this category,
but this year I did a ton of work for my kids' school, and did
it ever open my eyes to the amount of free labour the school boards
of Canada get from parents. I worked in the library, volunteered
in the classroom, helped run a craft room for a fundraiser, went
on a field trip, was class parent for Delphine's class, and signed 
up to head the Eco-committee.</p>
<p>This year I hope to actually <em>do</em> something as head of the Eco-committee,
and I'm going to try and pursuade our School Council to donate some
money to a school without so many deep-pocketed parents. I suppose
I'll be roped into running the craft room again next Christmas, too.</p>
<h5>Fun / creativity / recreation</h5>
<p>You know, I've been thinking about fun lately, specifically in the
context of play. The children play most of the time and work hardly
at all—Delphine works a little bit at school, and she has
a couple of jobs at home, but most of her time is free time.
Cordelia is four—she plays at school and she plays at home,
and her only job is feeding the cat. </p>
<p>But when do I play? On the one hand I'm in the very lucky position
of rarely having to do something which I'm not intrinsically motivated
to do. I look after the children because I love them, I take care
of the house because I want my house to be taken care of. I
read and write because I love to do so, I have fun volunteering
for the school. There is almost nothing I do that's pure drudgery.
And a lot of what I do is pure fun: most of my reading, choir,
my friendships, and watching TV are all things I do for myself.</p>
<p>In 2010 I would like to read more, and keep singing and seeing
my friends. I'm even happy with the amount of TV I watch, or
rather with the quality of TV I watch. I should try and
use my time more mindfully, so I don't fritter it away. I have
too much fun stuff to do to spend time doing things which are merely
diverting.</p>
<p>That's that. It's 12:21 am on January 1. I hope everyone
has a wonderful year in 2010!</p>

Living newsletter <a href="http://www.davidco.com/productive_living.php">here</a>.
I've only received one, so I don't know how good they generally
are, but since I used the latest one to inspire this post
I figure I should at least point you to the source. I
do use the Getting Things Done system and find it very effective
and comprehensive.)</p>
