For those of you who inexplicably check the blog before the baby
gallery, <a href="http://baby.latte.ca/pics/">there are new
pictures up</a>.  <em>Lots</em> of new pictures.
</p>
<p>
She's napping now so I'm typing on borrowed time, so excuse 
sentence fragments.
</p>

Work:  Have some, working for my father-in-law, liking it but then
it's only a couple of hours a week.  It's a nice change of scenery
and it's good to be appreciated.  The nice thing about my father-in-law
is that he appreciates me.  At least to my face; who knows what he
says about me behind my back -- he's kind of notorious for bitching
about his employees.  That's fine with me, as long as he keeps the
compliments and money coming.  It's not like I never talk about folk
behind their backs.
</p>
<p>
I'm hoping the daycare I put Delphine on the waiting list for will
have an opening in January, which seems like forever but will eventually
come.  I signed up for two days a week, which will be just perfect.
I think she will love it, and I think I will love being able to work
again.  It will be nice to be able to spend good chunks of time at the
office and really make a contribution.  Right now I feel like I'm just
filling in holes and "helping out".
</p>
<p>
Delphine is sleeping well, from seven until six-thirty.  If I were
smarter I would be going to bed at a reasonable hour and getting lots
of rest, but instead for the last couple of weeks I've been staying up
late reading and watching <em>The Daily Show</em> and putting pictures
on the web.
</p>
<p>
The US election is freaking me out.  How can half the country want to
vote for Bush?  Honestly, how a country can be simultaneously so great
and so fucked up I just don't know.  Again, glad to be here and not
there.  It's also freaking me out how much of a news story the election
is here; people routinely refer to it as "the election", not "the
US election".  "Did you watch the debate last night?"  There's a local
bar that's having a shindig on the night of the election, showing it on
their TVs and having debates and such, just as they did with <em>our</em>
election.  (We will be watching <em>The Daily Show</em> live coverage,
of course.  I think I kind of have a crush on Jon Stewart.)
It's horrifying how much effect the results of their election
affect us, and yet we have no say. (Of course, and rightly so, but still
horrifying.  Just vote Kerry, okay, for the love of god?  You can vote
for <a href="http://www.digitalism.com/rhudson/">Rob</a> next time.)

I started taking square dancing a while ago, where by started I mean I
went to one class and then bailed.  The second class coincided with a
condo board meeting, and since I'm president of the condo board I thought
I'd better be there.  When the third class rolled around I weighed the
relative benefits of tromping around in circles with lovely old people
to whom I would have to be friendly and polite, or sitting like a tumour
on the couch, and the couch tumour won out.  I would feel worse, but the
idea of signing up was to get exercise, and the old dears move so slowly
that there was really no exercise being got.  I guess I should have seen
that coming.  Next time I'll sign up for step dancing or sword dancing
or something.  In the meantime I'm just trying to go out walking every day.
</p>
<p>
This weekend I'm going to dye my hair back to a decent shade of brownish-black.
I'm still suffering the reddish colour it turned out when I tried to 
dye it light brown, and now it has the brown plus grey roots coming in
as well.  Nice.  
I'm also growing it out, which means it has been and
will continue to be awful.  I got a trim a couple of weeks ago, so it's
less awful than it might be, and I will get another in December.  
My stylist seems to
know what he's doing and to have a plan as to how to grow it out, which is
heartening since in the past all I have done is just stop getting it cut.
Perhaps this will work better.
</p>
<p>
I still need to think of a costume for Delphine for Halloween.  So far I
have come up with "70s Baby", "Ninja", and Morgan and Erik need a fourth
for their Kiss costume, but they're going to a party and when bedtime
is seven o' clock partying is out of the question.  I am hindered by the
fact that I do not want to spend any money, time or effort on the costume.
Wish me luck.
