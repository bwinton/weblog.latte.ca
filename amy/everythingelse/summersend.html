<p>It's only August 30 but it was cold today—it didn't even break
20 degrees. Between that and the impendingness of back-to-school,
I'm feeling that Fall urge to do something new and interesting.
Where is my new backpack, my textbooks and paper, my list of
classes with unfamiliar room numbers, my anticipation of learning
something and meeting new people? Oh, that's right, overwhelmed by
my children's lives. Which is fine, for a while. Cordelia, at least,
has a new backpack. Delphine doesn't have any new school supplies
because the school, curse them, provides everything she needs.
Don't they know how much I love to buy school supplies?
Although I did buy myself two pairs of pants and three pairs of
shoes on sale at Lands' End!</p>
<p>I applied to take a Toronto Civics course offered by the
City of Toronto, but I wasn't accepted. They were trying
to achieve a high level of diversity in the participants, and
I guess someone had already filled the straight white female
spot. Boo. Sometime, not this term, I would like to take a writing
course somewhere (if they turn out to be worthwhile), but 
this fall my only New and Exciting things will be Momming
a Grade One-er and a Kindergartener, and midwifing my writing
career. Which, come to think of it, is fairly huge, although entirely
self-directed and so less fun than taking a class.</p>
<hr>
<p>The girls and I had plenty of fun last week. On Wednesday we went
to Centreville, an amusement park on Toronto's Centre
Island. Delphine was petrified by the Bee Ride, and chose
a stationary horse (not an up-and-down one) on the carousel. Cordelia
loved everything and went on the (baby, but still scary!) roller coaster
with me. Delphine's favourite thing was the pony ride, although she lined
up for it for about twenty-five minutes and I swear the ride was only
a minute and a half long. Lucky for me, I didn't line up with 
her—the heroic Kat did, while fending off a gaggle of badly
raised little hooligans who were trying to cut ahead. Kat also 
took the girls on the Annoying Swan Ride, so I owe her big time.</p>
<p>Thursday we stayed in the neighbourhood;
we went into the school to meet Cordelia's new teacher. I
love her already—I'm so pleased she opened her classroom to
us a few days before the start of school, because Cordelia has gone
from being scared of going to school to being thrilled by the idea.
It took Cordelia about thirty seconds to feel at home in her new
classroom, and to make friends with her new teacher.</p>
<p>On Friday I took the girls, plus Ursa, to see the IMAX movie 
<em>Under The Sea</em> at the
Science Centre. We were only going to stay for a while but we 
ended up spending the entire day there (and freaking out Ursa's
parents). We visited a special exhibit on reptiles, and a
special exhibit on spies (Delphine's favourite), and spent some
time in the little kids' area. We capped it all off with the
obligatory visit to the rainforest, and were home by five.</p>
<p>It was a genuine pleasure to spend the day at the
Science Centre with the girls.  Now that they're older, 
for one thing, and I've decided <a href="http://www.freerangekids.com/">not to
worry about them so much</a> for another, I really enjoy being with
them, and watching them enjoy themselves. Delphine and Ursa
seemed to get a lot more value out of the Science
Centre together than they do when they're alone—being
able to talk over the exhibits and play off each other while they
experimented really added meaning and depth to their experience. It was
a real-life demonstration of the power of collaborative learning.</p>
<p>Next week we have more fun in store: tomorrow a friend is coming over
with her brood to enjoy a belated birthday KFC feast; Tuesday I am
looking after Ursa and her little brother Otis all day while their
folks move—we will probably go to the library; Wednesday we
have a playdate with Delphine's BFF. Delphine's BFF has a little
sister for Cordelia to play with, and a mother for me to chat with,
so it's a whole family playdate. Those are the best. Thursday 
Blake is taking the afternoon off and we are going to take
High Tea at the Royal York, just because. And Friday the girls
have their back-to-school haircuts at the Fiorio Academy.</p>
<p>Oh, and we're having a no-TV week. The girls have been watching
way too much TV, so we cut them off for the week. Out of
some misguided notion of fairness, Blake and I aren't watching
TV all week either. I expect to do plenty of blogging, reading, 
and sleeping. Hm, that doesn't sound so bad.</p>
