<p>Christmas this year started a little earlier than usual with the
screening of <a href="http://www.tafelmusik.com/">Tafelmusik</a>'s 
Sing-Along Messiah documentary in mid-November. They screened it 
at a theatre nearby, and I was invited because I'm friends with
one of their marketing people. I invited Kat and Tanya as my
plus-one, and we had a lovely evening out.</p>
<p>More Messiah ensued a couple of weeks later with my choir's performance
thereof, which went fantastically well. We've done Messiah so many times
I think people are actually starting to relax and enjoy singing it.</p>
<p>Our first Christmas party was at a friend of the family's. I'm sure he'd
like to stop inviting us because we never talk to anyone we're not 
related to, and we eat like crazy, but we always enjoy ourselves.</p>
<p>Around mid-December I went to a free choir and organ concert at 
Roy Thomson Hall, with the Elmer Iseler Singers. Another good concert,
and they had a couple of sing-along numbers. One of the sing-alongs
was the Hallelujah chorus, but I was the only person in my area who
sang along with any enthusiasm — it's a bit of a funny choice
for a sing-along, really. I belted it out anyway.</p>
<p>That week was the last week of school, so we were invited to Cordelia's
class party, and I went to the school Holiday Sing-Along assembly. Then
on that weekend I went to a free concert at Yorkminster in aid of 
CHUM Christmas Wish — admission was free but they asked for a
donation of a toy. It was a fantastic lineup: True North Brass,
High Park Children's Choirs, Richard Margison and Isabel Bayrakdarian.
For free! I went for Isabel Bayrakdarian (and the sing-along Christmas
carols), but she gave a rather
predictable performance of <em>Oh Holy Night</em>. Richard Margison sang
some vaguely familiar Disney-esque duet with his pop-singing daughter
Lauren, but then she left the stage and he treated us to a toe-curling
rendition of <em>Nessun Dorma</em>. I admit I've never really been into opera,
but this particular performance reached all the way up to the balcony
and grabbed me. I couldn't stay for the whole concert, but I believe
I was there for the best bit.</p>
<p>I had to leave early because we were on our way to a party at our
old/new friends the Theysmeyers'. It was terrific to meet their neighbours but
best was reconnecting with old friends from university, some who I
hadn't seen since well before Delphine was born. Delphine and Cordelia
had a great time as the senior kids at the party — the host's kid
is four and everyone else was that age or younger, so my girls took charge.</p>
<p>Thursday night we had some people over to eat cookies and sing some more
carols, and then Friday (Christmas Eve) we had nothing to do — the
house was clean, the fridge was full of party food. (I actually
got some work done.) Later in the day David Wolever came over for a quick
visit and dropped off an Arduino for Blake and a clickety IBM Model M
keyboard (with USB converter cable!) for me. So awesome! So we fed him
cookies.</p>
<p>And today was Christmas. Delphine was sick last night and stumbled out
of her room at 10 pm all miserable and damp and sore. I fed her some
ibuprofen and tucked her back in, but not before she noticed her stocking
was full. I feigned ignorance. Maybe Santa came in through the bathroom
exhaust vent?</p>
<p>Delphine being sick meant that she didn't wake up at the crack of dawn
to open her stocking, so at around 7:00 I and the girls went downstairs and
the girls investigated their stockings while I experimented with
making cinnamon buns with biscuit dough. (Hypothesis: yum! Result: 
hypothesis confirmed!) We ate, then everyone got dressed before we dug
into the presents.</p>
<p>Blake was very happy with <em>The Calculus Diaries</em> by Jennifer Ouellette,
a iPhone holder for working out with, and a Cybertool Swiss Army knife
with about a billion tools which will be very useful when he's messing
with his new Arduino. </p>
<p>I got a ceramic figurine of a little girl standing by a bucket — the
bucket doubles as a candle holder — from Delphine, and an
<a href="http://www.ihomeaudio.com/iP90BZ/">iHome alarm clock</a> from
Blake, as well as some chocolate, earrings and stationery (-ary?) from my cousin,
who always buys me unambitious but excellent gifts.</p>
<p>The girls loved their Playmobil, Quadrilla marble run, books, playdough
(for Cordelia) and 
<a href="http://www.mastermindtoys.com/Alex-Colour-a-Purse.aspx">colour-in-able 
purse</a> (for Delphine). Delphine was pretty happy to spend the day 
convalescing on the couch and reading her new Magic Tree House books from
Cordelia.</p>
<p>We had all the usual suspects for Christmas Dinner, as well as Auntie 
J'Anne and a co-worker of Morgan's who needed a loaner family for
Christmas. She fit right in. Our very special guest this year was baby
Charlie, who was celebrating (but not really enjoying) his first Christmas.</p>
<p>Dinner was pretty good. I did two roasts (I have to ask them to leave the
prime rib in one piece the next time we order cow), roasted potatoes,
and Yorkshire puddings, and Morgan brought salad. (Baba brought wine
and appetizers.) The beef was fine, the potatoes were okay but not crispy,
and the Yorkshires were fine. Part of the problem was that there were
no drippings from the beef, so we had to do the potatoes and Yorkies
with canola oil, which I think we didn't heat up enough. Still, it was
well-received. The Christmas pudding with brandy butter and whipped
cream seemed to go down pretty smooth too, but just in case, we served
a giant Toblerone and a gingerbread house as well.</p>
<p>For after dinner entertainment we tried to teach Morgan's friend how
to do cryptic crosswords, and I made everyone play "Twinkle Twinkle" 
on the pitched whistles from our Christmas crackers. (Everyone got a
numbered note, and I yelled out each person's number: "1 1! 5 5! 6 6!
5! 4 4! 3 3! 2 2! 1! 5 5! 4 4! 3 3! 2 2! 5 5!..." and so on.) $25 well
spent, I believe.</p>
<p>Then we all sat around and digested and played with the children's
toys until it was (their) bedtime. Now that everyone else has either gone
home or is tucked in, Blake is watching a video 
about dragons and I'm drinking sherry and listening to Christmas 
music. A fantastic day all 'round (unless you're Delphine).</p>
