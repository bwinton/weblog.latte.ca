A while ago I said I was going to cut down to 2000 calories a
day, but I've been having a hard time doing so.  It seems so lame, 
when you consider that there are so many people on 1200 and 1600 cpd
diets, that I can't even cut down to a still-excessive 2000 cpd.  The
difference for me is that when you're on a diet, you know it's a 
temporary thing, that even if you can't have the cookie or the chocolate
today, one day when you're not on the diet anymore you'll be able to.
Since my diet isn't a temporary change, I am reluctant to give things up
because I know it's forever.
</p>
<p>
My ultimate goal is to eat an average of 1800 calories per day.  You
need to take in about 1600 calories per day to get all the nutrients
you need; that's 1600 calories of real food, leafy vegetables and
whole grains and lean meat and fruit.  At 1800 calories a day that
only leaves 200 calories free for "fun" food.  That's less than a 
chocolate bar.  That's just two cookies.  I'm sure there are plenty
of people in this world who live without having fun food every day, but
I'm not sure I want to be one of them.
</p>
<p>
This resistance to giving up treats is what has made it so hard to
break the 2000 calorie barrier.  I've been hovering around 2050 for
the last few days, but yesterday I decided if I can be under 2000 every
day this week, I will reward myself with some tacky makeup or something
on the weekend.
</p>
<p>
I have a couple of strategies I'm working on.  One is to have a big
breakfast with lots of protein and fruit, to keep me going without hunger
until lunchtime.  Then theoretically I'll be able to have a smallish lunch.
</p>
<p>
Another strategy is to keep digestive 
cookies in the house.  It sounds counter-intuitive to diet by keeping 
cookies in the house, but digestives are pretty low calorie*, and a couple of 
them plus a cup of tea are enough to satisfy my desire for
a treat in the afternoon.  If I don't have them around, I'm likely to
go to Starbucks and get a 200 calorie mocha and a 500 calorie scone.
I think of them as a pressure valve.
</p>
<p>
[*Actually digestives are still pretty high calorie -- around 75 calories
each.  I think next time I will buy social tea biscuits or something,
which are only around 22 calories each.  That way I can have six of them!]
</p>
<p>
Anyway, having said that, I weighed myself at the doctor's office 
this morning and
I have lost another 5 lbs to bring me down to 190, with a BMI of 30.7.  That's
only 0.7... um....  BMI units? away from being merely "overweight", not "obese".
How exciting!
</p>
<p>
I'm curious to see if I plateau at 185, since I have never been able to
diet down past 185.  I think that might be my adult low, actually.  (I 
don't know what I weighed in high school, although I do know I was wearing
size 36 Levi 501s.  I should go try on a pair and see if I fit into them.)
</p>
<p>
I've lost a total of 42 lbs from my pre-pregnancy weight, but I don't 
feel 42 lbs smaller, and I don't think I look it.  I get the odd comment,
but not the barrage of compliments that you'd hope for when you've lost almost
20% of yourself. 
Part of the problem is
that I haven't bought many new clothes, so I'm still wearing my 230 lb
wardrobe; my look now is "baggy".  And of course there's the fact that
for so long I've been so militantly happy to be fat that most of my
friends know better than to say "You've lost weight!" as a compliment.  
Still, it would be nice to know that my shrinkage is perceptible to
others.
</p>
<p>
I read an article by a woman,
my height, who described herself as plump and unattractive.  Then she said
she needed to lose 20 lbs to feel desirable -- she was 155 lbs and wanted
to be 135.  Twenty pounds is the difference between unattractive and desirable,
and I've lost twice that!  Before, I felt like me, and now, I feel like
me.  I guess it's good that I don't invest my weight with so much meaning,
but the flip side of that coin is that when I lose weight I don't get
the big irrational ego boost.  Humph.
