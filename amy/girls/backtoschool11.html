<p>I haven't posted about the girls for ages because Delphine's not totally
comfortable with being the subject of a blog any more. I guess if you want to
get to know Delphine better you'll have to either meet her or wait until she
starts her own blog. But I might sneak in the odd post, like this one.</p>
<p>This week Delphine started Grade Three and Cordelia started Grade One.
Cordelia wasn't excited about starting Grade One until a few days before, when
her sister convinced her it would be fun. Delphine has had Cordelia firmly
under her wing since school started: they entered the first day fray together
(with strict instructions to us to stay out of the way) and they have been
meeting up at recess and sharing snacks. </p>
<p>Both girls love their respective teachers. Delphine is in a 2/3 split which
seems like it's going to be an awesome class. Cordelia is in a 1/2 split – I'm
not sure who is in that class but I really like the teacher so I think it will
be a good year for her, too.</p>
<p>More generally, Cordelia is still clinging to her baby status. She doesn't like
to read, although I think she reads better than she likes to let on.  She also
flat-out refused to learn to ride a bike this summer, although she's learning
to go like stink on the scooter to keep up with Big Sister. I'm curious to see
what being in Grade One will do for her carefully maintained aura of
incompetence. I'm pretty sure she steps up and shows her abilities when she's
at school, and I think soon she's going to have to accept that we know that she
can do stuff.</p>
<p>Cordelia has always had an affinity for numbers (as I expect I've mentioned)
and her report card last year said "Cordelia shows an avid interest in math".
I'm curious to see how that interest develops in Grade One's more advanced
math.</p>
<p>Cordelia's my little maker. Her catchphrase is "I could use that for
something!", whenever I try to throw away some interesting box or widget. And
indeed, if I let her have the thing she will cut it up and glue some other bits
to it and transform it into a building or a slide or a cat or some other
creation. I so want to take her to a Maker Faire.</p>
<p>Around about when she turned eight Delphine transformed from a little kid into
a pre-adolescent. I used to think "tween" was a nonsense marketing category,
but there's a marked difference between seven and eight. She's got a new
spirit, a little bit of sassiness and attitude, but not in a bad way; she's
still polite and civil (mostly) but she's got opinions.  A few of her rants:
"Why do they change everything when they make movies out of books?!" (with a
subrant: "'How to Train Your Dragon' was nothing like the book!"); "Everyone
thinks Canadians live in igloos!"; "Why does everyone drive everywhere?!"; and
one of my favourites, "Everyone else has a nice basement, why is ours is all
gross?!" She's going through a bit of a noisy, self-righteous phase which, if
she doesn't grow out of it, will serve her well on the Internet (or in the
Computer Science Club) some day. But it all comes from noticing the greater
world and realizing that there are different ways to be in it, and trying to
work out what your choices say about you.</p>
<p>This year she's starting ballet, which will hopefully teach her 
self-discipline and maybe some humility (unless she turns out to be really
good at it). She's still enjoying piano, and she's taking an art class
with Cordelia. Perhaps a little overscheduled; we'll see how it goes.</p>
