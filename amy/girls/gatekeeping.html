<p>My kids are great. They really are, despite occasional outbursts
to the contrary. Okay - here's what they do that's annoying: Cordelia
dawdles in the morning when it's time to get dressed; Delphine
whines when I ask her to clean up (or leave the playground, or 
stop doing whatever she is enjoying); while they do play nicely
together, they are both often impatient with each other and often
fight, usually about really stupid things.  That's all!  That's
not much, really.</p>
<p>Okay, there's one more thing.  The most annoying annoyance is 
the pestering: they pester me
for television, and for candy, and for trips to the park.  They
pester me to let them paint, or go play across the street.  They
ask, I say no, (or later, or tomorrow, or "you already had your
tv/candy for today"), and then they beg. They argue. They bargain.
They whine.  Sometimes they win, sometimes they lose, sometimes
they get distracted by something else, but however it ends it's
tedious and aggravating.</p>
<p>I don't control what they eat at mealtimes, I don't control
what they wear, I don't control what they play with, so they
don't pester me about that stuff.  The things which they pester 
me for are the things which I control; the things for which 
I'm the gatekeeper. </p>
<p>It must be so frustrating for them, to want something and to
have to get past me in order to get it. I really can't blame
them for pestering. I know if I wanted a lollipop or to watch
<em>Chuck</em> or something and someone was (apparently) arbitrarily 
preventing me from doing so, I would be pretty pissed off. 
I would do everything in my power to get what I wanted, even
if the only thing in my power was whining. Indeed, the very
fact that I couldn't have that lollipop would probably make
me much more obsessed with it than I would be if I could just
grab a lollipop whenever I wanted one.</p>
<p>I've tried to create some kind of external structure around
these things, so that it's not up to my whim. For example, 
the girls are allowed two TV shows
a day, and four a day on weekends. These are rules they helped
create and which they agreed to. Even so, they manage to
find all kinds of opportunities for negotiation: TV now or
later? Which shows? How long are they? Does Pingu count
as one show? No? How many Pingus count as a show? Ultimately
all these decisions <em>are</em> up to me, which puts all the power
in my hands and creates a very unpleasant dynamic where they
are constantly supplicating to me and I'm in control of their
happiness. This is not how I want my home to be.</p>
<p>So what to do? I guess we could come up with ever more specific
rules: TV only after school; three Pingus equals one Dora; one
Sesame Street equals two Doras; if Delphine watches something
while Cordelia is napping then Cordelia gets to pick the
next show... Augh. That way lies madness, and eight million
rules.</p>
<p>The assumption underlying all this, of course, is that if I
left these decisions: how much TV? How much candy?; in the 
hands of the kids, they would handle it badly. Is this assumption
valid? If I let them watch as much TV as they wanted, would
they watch it all the time? To the exclusion of doing other
things? What about candy? If there were candy available all
the time would they eat too much of it?</p>
<p>I can start to answer these questions by considering 
adult behaviour. (That's the logical extension of every parenting
dilemma, isn't it? "He's not going to be in diapers when he
goes to university."  "She's not going to keep eating only
white food for the rest of her life.") So, I know I have
gone through periods when I watched too much TV. I know I
have watched TV, even crap TV, to the exclusion of 
other, more valuable activities. There are plenty of people
out there who inarguably watch too much TV, for whom TV has
negatively affected their quality of life and prevented them
from living up to their potential.  It has taken a good deal
of self-restraint (and some technological tricks) to reduce
my TV watching to the level it's at now, and even still I
could probably afford to watch less.  I have to consciously
manage my TV habit; perhaps it is asking too much for a five-year-old
and a three-year-old to do the same, and it <em>is</em> appropriate
for me to manage it for them.  Perhaps I have to just suck
it up and deal with their whining as a part of being a
parent.</p>
<p>(I could write that whole paragraph over again for candy,
as I'm sure you can imagine.)</p>
<p>Incidentally, I'm thinking
of shutting off the TV altogether this summer.  (Well, at least
for the kids. I'm a giant hypocrite. Also there's no way Blake
would agree to not watching TV.) I have a friend whose
dad unplugged the TV every summer and I must say it sounds like
a fine idea. At least it will provide me with a short and easy
answer to any demands: "Sorry kids, no TV until school starts in
September." It might even curb the whining. Maybe.</p>
<p>I don't know the solution to this problem. Maybe I need to keep
explaining the importance of not watching too much
TV. Maybe I need to be more firm when they try and negotiate (I
think I'm pretty good at sticking to our existing rules but perhaps
I could be better.) Maybe I've been blessed with particularly
persistent children and I just need to be more patient. Maybe
I need to try harder to distract them.  Maybe I'll just keep trying
things until something works. Or they move out and buy their own
damn TV.</p>
