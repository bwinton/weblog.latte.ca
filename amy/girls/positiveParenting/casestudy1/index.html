<p>Positive parenting, or democratic parenting, is essentially
parenting as if your children are human beings who deserve
the same amount of respect as the adults in the household.
It is about raising your children to understand that they
are part of a community, with rights <em>and</em> obligations,
and it's about getting them to behave without punishments
or rewards. It's also evidence-based parenting, with
a grounding in scientific research and knowledge
of neurological development and psychology.</p>
<p>I was raised with respect and I want to raise my children with
respect, so I am using the tools of positive parenting to
guide me.</p>
<p>My leaders in this endeavour are <a href="http://www.alfiekohn.org/">Alfie 
Kohn</a> and <a href="http://www.alyson.ca/">Alyson Schäfer</a>.
They have both written excellent books on the subject. Both
Alyson Schäfer's books are about positive parenting (although
I prefer <em>The Good Mom Myth</em>), and Alfie Kohn's parenting book
is called <em>Unconditional Parenting</em>. If you're interested in
positive parenting I recommend you pick up one or both of those
books. (And then everything else Kohn has written, because he's
awesome.)</p>
<p>I'm not an expert on psychology or positive parenting, so I'm 
not going to give out advice here, but what I will do
is write about situations in our house, and how we managed them.
Some of these situations go smoothly, some of them don't, so
I'll talk about what I think worked, and what I wish I had done
differently. I hope this will give other parents some ideas about
how to parent positively, and I'll admit I hope that rehashing
these situations will reinforce my knowledge of positive parenting,
and help me apply positive parenting techniques more often.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Today Delphine (6) was invited to a friend's birthday party. Fifteen
minutes before we were to leave for the party, I told Delphine it
was time to get ready. She was wearing a stained t-shirt and a pair
of leggings with a hole in it, so I told her she would have to
change into something nicer.</p>
<p>She hated that idea. She wanted to wear what she was wearing,
because (she said) she didn't have any other leggings. (It was
a gymnastics party so she wanted to wear leggings rather than
jeans or a skirt.) I stuck to my guns and explained that in our culture
we show respect for people by wearing clean clothes to their
gatherings. Delphine countered with "But Erika won't care!"
Which is probably true, but I pointed out that Erika's mom
<em>will</em> care, and she did most of the work for the party. We finally
got to the point where I said I wouldn't take her to the party
unless she had some clean clothes on. </p>
<p>The situation was resolved by Blake going upstairs with Delphine
to help her pick out something appropriate—she ended
up borrowing a pair of leggings from Cordelia. It took quite a 
lot of gentle persuasion and friendly helpfulness from Blake
to get everything smoothed over.</p>
<p><strong>What I Wish I Had Done:</strong> I wish I had started the whole
conversation by saying "In our culture, we show respect and
affection for
people by wearing clean, tidy clothes to their special
occasions. Are you happy with the clothes you're wearing, or
would you like to find something else?" Alyson Schäfer
(can I just call her Alyson?) calls that TTFT, or Take
Time For Training. Usually she's talking about more mechanical
things, like doing up a zipper or cleaning a bathroom, but
it applies to social conventions, too. Giving Delphine
ownership of the problem would make her feel responsible, and
there's a pretty good chance she would have just changed without
a fuss.</p>
<p>If she still protested I could have gone with the 
"when-then" tactic: "When you're dressed for a birthday
party, then I will take you to the party." That's a little more
coercive because I'm basically saying, "I won't take you
to the party until you're dressed the way I want you to be
dressed", but the wording is impersonal and it does
reflect the needs of the situation (societal norms) rather
than what I want. (Rather conveniently, what I want is for
Delphine to conform to societal norms. When she's older she
can go to parties dressed like a slob, but she's still 
young enough that I don't think she fully understands the messages
that dressing inappropriately sends.)</p>
<p>Finally I wish we had started the whole thing earlier. One of
Alfie Kohn's parenting guidelines is "Don't be in a hurry",
and it's great advice if you can manage it. So much household
tension is caused by running short of time. If I had left more
time, we might still have had the drama but at least it wouldn't
have forced us to rush out the door after Delphine got changed.</p>
<p>In the end, Delphine got to the party on time, in nice clean
clothes, and hopefully we all learned something.</p>
