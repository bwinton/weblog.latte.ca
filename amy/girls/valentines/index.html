<p>We just came off a long weekend - Friday was a PA
Day (which means school is closed for those of you
who aren't from 'round here), and Monday was
"Family Day", a merciful and much-needed mid-winter
Ontario statutory holiday.  The weekend was full;
Friday the girls and I got together with friends.
Saturday we had <a href="http://www.musictogether.com/">music class</a>,
and then Delphine, Blake and I left Cordelia with Auntie
Morgan and Uncle Erik, and headed down to 
The Beaches for a birthday party for one of Delphine's
classmates.  While she was partying, we went to Dufflet
and enjoyed a tasty slice of cake while an orange and
white cat had a large and, I can only assume, satisfying 
poo in the garden outside the window.</p>
<p>It was great to hang out with Delphine by herself
for a while.  Both girls are really charming by 
themselves: Delphine
is thoughtful and interesting, Cordelia is intense
and funny.  Together they are often irritating,
to each other and thus to us.  So to take a nice long
transit ride with Delphine and get to hang out with
her and see the city was a real treat.  (How old do
you have to be before the view from the Bloor Street 
Viaduct stops blowing your mind?  Older than 
thirty-three, anyway.)</p>
<p>After the birthday party we came back uptown and
dropped Delphine off at Baba and Zaida's, with 
Cordelia, for a sleepover.  Then we went out to 
a movie!  We saw <em>Coraline</em>, in 3D.  (The movie was
great but the 3D was gratuitous.)</p>
<p>Sunday we slept in, then went in search of breakfast.
On the way home we picked up some groceries, and 
then relaxed for an hour or so before the girls came
home.  Later that day Kat came over, and the whole
family joined us for Sunday dinner.  After the girls
were in bed, Kat and Blake and I watched every 
<em>Being Erica</em> so far.  (Conclusion: good for now,
but Erica is going to have to stop saying stupid
things if she's going to keep our sympathies.  Moving
the plot along by making your protagonist repeatedly
screw up is lazy writing.)</p>
<p>Kat slept over, and the next morning we went skating
together.  In addition to her already-dizzying array
of talents and accomplishments, Kat is a Can-Skate
instructor and figure skater, so she taught
both Delphine and me some cool tricks.  I now have
muscle aches where I wasn't previously aware I had
muscles.</p>
<p>Kat headed home in the afternoon (after a long
and nearly fruitless search for an open grocery store),
and the weekend wound down quietly.</p>
<hr>
<p>Going out to see a movie was a nice treat, but the 
best part of our date was talking to
Blake before the movie, and on the way home, and 
the next morning when we went out for breakfast.
It was exactly like we were before the girls were
born, a relaxed, easy repartee.  We talked about all
kinds of things, we laughed at each other's jokes,
we worked on the cryptic and teased each other.
I was literally
shocked at how happy I was to be away from the children.
As I alluded to above, the girls have been a little
annoying lately and I guess it's been making me 
tenser than I realized.  </p>
<p>No, it's worse than that.  I felt <em>more like myself</em>
when I was away from the girls.  I felt like I was
the real me, the me who has a tidy
house and isn't mad all the time, the me who
talks to her husband about something other than
tomorrow's agenda and who is going to give up what
in order to take somebody somewhere.</p>
<p>I don't want to be one of
those mothers who is delighted to get away from
their kids!  I love my kids!  They are charming and
clever and fun.  I'm just overwhelmed by
them - five-and-a-half-years of almost non-stop
childcare is a lot. Maybe next year when Delphine 
is in school five hours a day, and Cordelia is in 
school half-days
I will have enough breathing space that I can properly
enjoy their company.  I want to like being with my kids, and
I want to feel normal when I'm with them, not
all stressed and crabby and resentful.  </p>
<p>But in the meantime, thank goodness for sleepovers.  No; 
thank Baba!</p>
