I know, it has been weeks since I posted.  If it makes you feel
any better, I haven't written any email either.  It's not so much
that I've been busy as I've been in a state of frozen panic, 
afraid to do anything that isn't related to real estate lest I
break the fragile thread that is holding together all these transactions
and agreements and unimaginably large sums of money.
</p>
<p>
But our real estate agent just called to say that all the documents
and amendments and waivers have been signed and everything is
going to go ahead, really truly, pinkie-swear.  It's real.
</p>
<p>
I'm not excited about the new house.  Actually, there is almost
nothing I am looking forward to about the new house; I am not
looking forward to climbing up and down stairs, I am not looking
forward to doing laundry in the basement, I am not looking forward
to hand-washing dishes, I am not looking forward to a bathtub with
no shower, I am not looking forward to being miles (okay, blocks)
away from the nearest Starbucks.
</p>
<p>
It is almost comical how this house doesn't add up. We made a 
wish list before we went house hunting:  big kitchen — not
really; two bathrooms — nope; big deck — nope; 
detached — no; shower — shower?!  I didn't <em>put</em>
"shower" on my wish list, because what house doesn't have a
shower?  Well, mine.
</p>
<p>
And yet I still love the house, our little tiny dark house, because
it is ours and we can do whatever we want with it; we can reno the
kitchen, we can add a room at the back (if the neighbours don't
mind — please don't let the neighbours mind), we can dig out
the basement and put in a laundry room and a den and a nice bathroom
with a crazy Japanese tub, we can fix up the bathroom upstairs,
we can add a big deck and a patio and do beautiful landscaping in
the front.
</p>
<p>
We're planning, soon after we move in, to add about fifteen feet
to the back — the kitchen is now at the back of the house,
and we are going to move the kitchen into the additional space
and put a kind of office slash play area where the kitchen is now.
(That's if we can afford it; we haven't had a quote from the
contractor yet.)  
</p>
<p>
We're going to put in new pale wood fifties-style 
fitted cabinets, a modern gas
stove (sorry, but the old stove is going; I will try and find a good
home for it), a new fridge, a dishwasher, a forties-inspired 
white subway tile backspash,
fifties-style blue countertops and blue linoleum on the floors.  We're
keeping the original sink and the white painted cabinet with the
amazing handles and hinges.  The office will house our fifties metal
desk and a set of fitted cabinets, matching the ones in the kitchen,
to house jackets and boots and things, as well as providing more pantry
space.  
</p>
<p>
Stylistically it's going to be, frankly, a retro pastiche combining
Deco elements from the forties with Moderne and Contemporary influences
from the fifties, and of course a few current pieces like the appliances
and lighting.  
Since Moderne and Contemporary are (ironically,
linguistically speaking) pretty much opposite, I have no idea if it
will work.  I am hoping it will kind of blend, organically.  I mean,
if it were 1956 and you had been living someplace for a while, you would
probably have all those elements in your home.  We'll see.  I figure after
it's been there for a few years and gotten bashed around a bit 
it will look fine.  And I will be used to it and won't care.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
What I am looking forward to is the location, which is the one thing
you can't add to a house.  The new house is halfway between the street
with the library, two patisseries, a bulk food store and a really nice
kids' clothing store, and another street which houses bakeries, 
butchers, a cheese store, a second-hand kids' stuff store, a new
kids' stuff store, two ice cream parlours, a drugstore and of course
Starbucks.  And by halfway, I mean less than ten minutes walk to either
street; maybe five minutes.
</p>
<p>
The bus stop is right on the corner, about three houses away, and the
bus comes every ten minutes.  And if you can't wait, it's only about
a ten or fifteen minute walk to the subway.
</p>
<p>
The block is also thick with children; there are about a dozen houses
on the block and all but maybe one or two have children.  The school
is an easy walk away, and it's one of the best in the city.  So, you
know, it could be worse.
