Somehow, inexplicably, I have nothing to do.  There is no
pressing housework, I have no paperwork to do, I can't knit
because it takes too much concentration and unbroken blocks
of time, I've read and read and read until my eyes are bleeding.
</p>
<p>
I guess it's not inexplicable.  Christmas is over and there
isn't another errand-intensive event like that in the forseeable
future.  More significantly, Delphine now plays by herself for
reasonably long stretches of time, so jobs that used to take 
hours to do in between attending to her, now take a few minutes.
My last problem is that this wintery weather is stretching
on interminably, and I have nasty cabin fever.  I've been hiding
inside, only going out for necessities, for weeks now and I'm
tired of it.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, next week is rich with activities;  Monday is
choir, Tuesday I'm trying to set up a board games night, 
Wednesday morning is playgroup, Thursday I'm going to see
Ellen and Dexter, and Friday is a baby storytime at the
Mount Pleasant library.  If that doesn't keep me amused,
or at least busy, nothing will.

Let's get that bit of glurge off the top of the page, shall we?  I
called my brother and he is JUST FINE, he is not a child or an emotional
cripple, he does not need me to take care of him, he is perfectly
capable of living in a city without me there without falling into
the pit of despair.
</p>
<p>
Seriously, I always think he's much more miserable than he really is.
He sends me these long gloomy Eeyoreish emails about how awful 
everything is and I get all upset.   Then I talk to him on the 
phone and he says the same things, but he says them with a smile
in his voice and I can imagine the spark in his pretty blue eyes
and I know he's okay.
</p>
<p>
I, on the other hand, am running out of money, am freaking out
about it, am so clumsy and nervous and excitable that I seriously 
took a pregnancy test today (negative).  I need a break, or something,
and Delphine <em>won't stop crying</em>.  Feh.  Soon Blake will be
home and we can go to Starbucks and cook a pizza or something 
and watch bad television, and then it will be the weekend, hoorah.

It's my brother's thirtieth birthday today, and he's alone at work
in Vancouver right now.  He was supposed to be visiting my parents
but he couldn't take time off because of a deadline.
</p>
<p>
I didn't get him anything; he's planning to move to Japan so he
didn't want anything heavy, and I don't know what he likes to
listen to or what video games he plays.  I didn't want to just get
him something for the sake of getting him something, so I ended
up getting him nothing at all, which is kind of sad in that it's
nice to get presents, but in some ways an inappropriate or unwanted
gift is worse than no gift at all.  Or so I tell myself.  I hope
he doesn't mind, or think I don't love him or think about him, because
I do.
</p>
<p>
He's not happy in Vancouver; it's not working out for him.  The 
weather is miserable, he doesn't love work.  I worry about him.  In some
ways I wish he had moved to Toronto instead of Van, so I could see
him and keep an eye on him and take care of him.  But in some ways
(most notably geographically, but also culturally, I think) 
Vancouver is closer to Japan, which is his goal and something I
want him to achieve.  So maybe it's best that he's there and not
here.  But I still miss him terribly.
</p>
<p>
I love you, Dave.  Happy thirtieth.

Delphine and I walked down to St Clair to have lunch with Del's Grandpa
today, and on the way we stopped at Shopper's Drug Mart to pick up some
stuff.  Specifically, I need some new moisturizer for my face, something
with SPF.  I was going to pick up some Neutrogena SPF 45 I had heard about,
because apparently SPF 15 isn't high enough.
</p>
<p>
Two problems; first, they didn't have Neutrogena SPF 45, the highest they
had was 30.  Second, the SPF 30 was, I shit you not, twenty dollars.
Twenty dollars for face lotion is too damn much.  I already spend that
for a tub of alpha-hydroxy cream which makes my zits go away, I'm not about
to add another $20 tub-o-gold to my repertoire.  So I ended up getting
another bottle of the Oil of Olay stuff I'm using now, for ten
dollars, which is still five dollars too much.  I'm seriously thinking
of getting a bottle of regular old sunblock and using that instead;
deep in my heart I know that there's nothing special about the stuff
they pour into the face cream bottles and sell for a million dollars
an ounce.  It probably comes out of the same vat as the five dollar
no-name hand lotion.
</p>
<p>
I also got a box of Natural Instincts temporary hair dye in Hazelnut 
or some such nutty
colour; right now my hair is reddish brown with about an inch of 
dark brown plus grey at the roots, and I want to cover up the reddish
and even it all out.  I'm never sure what colour to buy to match
my natural colour, and I either end up with almost-black or something
too light which makes my hair look too red.  God, my life is hard.
</p>
<p>
The last thing I got was Aveeno diaper rash cream.  Del's had a
minor diaper rash for about three months now, and the only thing
which really makes it go away is cortisone, and that only temporarily.
I haven't tried the Aveeno stuff yet, and I'm sure it won't be any
different than everything else on the market, but it's worth a try.
It's got to smell better than Desitin, anyway.

Another gastronomic breakthrough for Delphine today; we both
had the same thing for lunch, Habitant Pea Soup.  I thought it
was time to introduce Delphine to the lard food group.
</p>
<p>
She also had bananas, yogurt and rice cereal mashed up, for dessert.
I had cucumber sandwiches on thinly sliced, homemade oat bread with
a chutney and horseradish mayonnaise.  Sometimes I eat fancy.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
In other food news, I'm still trying to redeem my averages from
Christmas, and the post-Christmas leftover eating.  It doesn't
help that on Friday I had a three thousand calorie day.  The horrifying
thing is that it wasn't all that hard; pastry for breakfast, 
a jam sandwich as an afternoon snack, a grande mocha for a treat after
Blake got home, pizza and wings for supper and a half-cup of
frozen yogurt for dessert.  Any of those things alone would be
reasonable, but when you have them all in one day...  Well, three
thousand calories.
</p>
<p>
It makes me realize that I must have had a lot of three thousand
calorie days back when I wasn't paying attention.  Sort of
explains the 240 lb thing; genetics, my ass.
</p>
<p>
In an attempt to get my averages back in line, and also as an
experiment, I had a sixteen hundred  calorie day on 
Saturday.  Also, surprisingly, not that hard.  Toast and tea
for breakfast, hot and sour soup for lunch, another mocha 
(tall this time), and salad for supper, but a tasty salad
with facon and egg and cheese.  We even had dessert, custard
made with skim milk.  There's hope yet.

If I learned anything from 
<a href="http://www.celluloideyes.com/holidailies/">Holidailies</a> it
was that it takes a village to write an entry, or at least a household.
Each entry I wrote was a commitment of at least forty-five minutes,
and I'd need Blake to look after Delphine while I wrote it.  Most of
the entries I wrote after dinner, in the evening, when we would normally
be going to bed, and I think it shows.
</p>
<p>
Long story short, since apparently I don't even have time to write
a little weblog entry, I'm shutting down my other journal for the 
forseeable future (probably until Delphine and Little Number Two
are in grade school) and writing here instead.  (Later when I have
time I will put a note to that effect on the journal page.)  
I think it will be easier to write more often
with a weblog.  And hell, some of my
