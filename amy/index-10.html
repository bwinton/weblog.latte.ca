<strong><em>In Your Face: The Culture of Beauty and You</em> 
by Shari Graydon</strong> is a beauty myth primer for teens,
and as such didn't really tell me anything I didn't already
know, although I think it did me good to be reminded of this
stuff.  I've been watching too much <em>What Not To Wear</em>
and am starting to think that it's good and right to want to
be pretty all the time.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Risk: A Practical Guide for Deciding What's Really 
Safe and What's Really Dangerous in the World Around You</em> by 
David Ropeik and George Gray</strong>.  This is really what
it claims to be: a practical guide.  It's a huge list of
everything you think is scary -- radiation, electromagnetic
waves, pesticide residue, tap water -- with discussions of
how scared you should actually be, and why, and what you
can do to protect yourself.  This would be a handy reference
book to keep around the house.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>An Intelligent Person's Guide to Judaism</em> by 
Shmuel Boteach</strong>.  (Actually now I'm not sure whether
I got the 1999 edition by "Shmuel" or the 2006 edition by
"Shmuley".  I wonder what else changed...)  I got this because
I am vaguely interested in Judaism and also because I love
Shmuley's show on TLC.  As it turns out, Judaism is pretty
cool but I can't get past the believing in God requirement.
I guess that's a pretty fundamental part of this whole
Abrahamic religion thing but I just can't do it.
</p>
<p>
Some other thoughts: Shmuley doesn't like Ashkenazi
culture.  What's wrong with knishes?  What's wrong with
klezmer?  Nothing, that's what!  
</p>
<p>
The part refuting the Christian idea of suffering
being a means to better oneself threw me for a loop
because I realized I have bought that concept entirely.
When someone claims that their suffering made them
stronger I nod agreeably; it had never even occurred
to me that it might not be so.  I'm still not sure
that it is always false; I think that some suffering
is good for you.  Where Shmuley and I may differ is
in the scale of the suffering under consideration;
he is talking about being, say, imprisoned and used
for creepy medical experimentation where I am thinking
more of, say, not having a TV in your bedroom.
</p>
<p>
The whole section about women was a little creepy.  I'm
just not sure where I stand on the whole gender thing
these days. Having read <em>Gender Wars</em> (and
having a working brain) I know
that women are not identical to men; being a feminist I
believe that women are legally, morally and in every
other way equal to men; being a mathematician I know
that the differences between men and women in most
meaningful scales are less significant than the 
variation within either group; being a parent I believe
that someone has to put the home and family first
and their career second.  Shmuley thinks that the
woman is most biologically suited to that role, but
I don't think that's so.  Shmuley also says women
are naturally more spiritual than men, gentler,
more compassionate, smell better -- a lot of nice
things which make me think maybe I am being 
patronized.  Maybe not, though, perhaps I am over-sensitive
and suspicious.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I will read some more Shmuley books and see
how they are.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Better House and Planet</em> by Marjorie
Harris</strong> is a book about how to keep your house 
in an environmentally sensitive manner.  It's actually
one of those "1000 Household Tips"-type books that 
were popular in the eighties.  I took it out because
I wanted some tips on cleaning without using nasty
cleaning products, but this book is more like a big
game of "Bullshit or not?!"  A sliced avocado won't brown
if you don't take the stone out: bullshit or not?  
Bullshit!  I can't remember any more, but this book
had a concentration of about one urban legend per
two pages.  
</p>
<p>
Very disappointing, and I still don't know
how to clean without using nasty products.  Maybe
I will just use vinegar for everything.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The World's Best Street &amp; Yard Games</em> by Glen 
Vecchione</strong> is a collection of all the cool games
you played (or didn't play, in my case) when you were a kid,
and lots more besides.  Games for when you are feeling rowdy
or when you are all dressed up and can't get dirty; games
for day and games for night; games for the sidewalk and
games for the park.  It's an excellent collection,
and it made me wish the girls would hurry up and grow up
so we could play.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Cross Bones</em> by Kathy Reichs</strong>.  Another
good Kathy Reichs, although again her sentence fragments —
and paragraphs consisting entirely of a single sentence
fragment — got on my nerves.  And this time her
"my subconscious is trying to tell me something"
shtick that she does at the end of every book she writes
annoyed me as well.  (Then Jeffrey Deaver did it in his
book too — do all mystery writers do it and I just
never noticed before?  Surely not.)
</p>
<p>
But what annoyed me most of all was how much they screwed 
up this character and the stories when they made the TV
series <em>Bones</em>.  It's like they threw out everything
that was good about the books, threw in David Boreanaz and
half-baked the whole thing.  Is that show even still on?
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Naked</em> by David Sedaris</strong> is very 
funny and good, although his constant moaning about what
a sad loser he is is a bit of a demotivator when after all,
he is the one who wrote the book and there you are sitting
at home reading it.  If he's a sad loser, what does that
make you?  I don't really know how he went from being a
sad loser to having his book on my shelf, but there you go.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, if you like this you might like the 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/books/_2006/mar31.html">David
Rakoff book I read a while ago</a>; they are both gay New 
Yorkers named David who do weird things and write about them
amusingly.  
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>When You Lunch With The Emperor</em> by Ludwig Bemelmans</strong>.
Anyone who has read to Delphine knows that Ludwig Bemelmans
is the <em>Madeline</em> guy, but apparently he also
wrote books for grown-ups.  This is a collection of his
autobiographical essays; witty, cutting but not catty,
poignant, favourable adjective, favourable adjective.  
I will read more of his stuff eventually; you should too.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Twelfth Card</em> by Jeffrey Deaver</strong>.
This is a Lincoln Rhyme book; if you remember the movie
<em>The Bone Collector</em>, it was an adaptation of an
earlier Lincoln Rhyme book starring Denzel Washington
as Lincoln Rhyme in an unusual spot of race-blind casting.
Unfortunately it caused me some mild confusion at the 
beginning of this book, because the Lincoln Rhyme in the
book is not only white but is required by the plot to be
somewhat ignorant of black culture.  Once I sorted out
the "he's actually white" thing I was fine.
</p>
<p>
The book was heavy on information, with lots of clunky sentences
like "Mel Cooper lifted several samples off the tape and ran
them through the gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, the 
workhorse instrument in all forensic labs.  It separates 
unknown trace into its component parts and then identifies them."
Smooth, but then I suppose you have to get that information
out somehow, and I would rather the author just blurt it 
out rather than giving it to a character as some crude
expository dialogue: "Mrs.
Jones, this is a gas chromatograph slash mass spectrometer.
Perhaps you already know that it is the workhorse..."
</p>
<p>
I supposed the "romance" between Sachs and Rhyme (or as
I think of them, Angelina and Denzel) is developed in
one of the earlier books, but in this book I just 
couldn't see the attraction; Rhyme seemed like a
patronizing ass, and Sachs seemed to be annoyed with
him much of the time.  As I would be.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, having said all that, still an enjoyable read
with a damn good mystery, some surprising twists and a 
satisfying result.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Get Your Tongue Out Of My Mouth, I'm Kissing You Goodbye</em> 
by Cynthia Heimel</strong>.  Despite the tacky title and 
the even tackier cover, this was a collection of good, funny
essays by an author I hadn't encountered before.  I
will see if she has written anything more recent though,
because this book was really dated: she makes references to Miatas
and <em>Ghost</em>, she claims New Yorkers don't eat sushi
and that you shouldn't wear high heels with jeans.  It
boggles the mind, really, but I suppose that's what
happens when you write a pop culture book.

<strong>Neutrogena Fresh Cooling Body Mist Sunblock, SPF 30</strong>:
This is the stuff that is advertised that you don't have to rub it in, 
you just spray it on.  I hate using sunblock because of the sticky
goo factor, so I thought I would try this.  It's an old-school metal
aerosol can, which I don't usually buy because they're so hideous
for the environment.  It does indeed spray in a very fine mist;
so fine that about sixty percent of it flies into the air and 
never actually makes it to your skin.  Instead it goes all over
your bathroom, or worse, into your lungs.  Well, into your
nose; hopefully it doesn't actually make it to your lungs.  
It's so bad that I banish the children from the bathroom
and put on the extractor fan before I use it.
It also gets caught in all the little 
hairs, so I wonder how much of it is really reaching my 
skin.  And to add injury to insult, it gave me a painful,
itchy, flaking rash on my neck and shoulders.  Boo.  I am
using it up on my feet and the tattoo on my ankle, and I will
never buy it or any other aerosol sunblock again.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, I do like gel-based sunblocks for me and Blake
and sunblock in stick form for the girls.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 55</strong>,
for daily use as a facial moisturizer/sunblock.  I
bought this because of a recommendation years ago from Katie
on The Suspects.  I had been using the Oil of Olay face
lotion with sunblock, but that left me really greasy and shiny,
so I'd have to use powder on top.  Katie said this stuff left
a really nice finish, so I gave it a try and I love it.  It
goes on quite thick but really does dry to a powdery finish;
it doesn't feel heavy at all.  It's not meant as a moisturizer
so I don't know how it would be for someone who needs a lot of
moisture on their face, but for me it's perfect.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Anita Nursing Bra Model 5058</strong>.  The previous
gold standard for nursing bras was the 
<a href="http://www.anita.com/de/en/148,1,104,1480,39183__products-detail.htm">Anita 
5062</a>; two
separate bra boutiques sold me that bra and it is a 
fantastic bra.  However, last time I went to my bra
shop they showed me the 
<a href="http://www.anita.com/de/en/148,1,104,1480,41666__products-detail.htm">new
5058</a> and it's even better; it has more cotton so it's
less stretchy and provides, as they put it, more "lift".
More lift means my boobs are up where they're supposed 
to be and my midsection appears mysteriously thinner.
It also has pretty pink ribbon, which is good for morale.
Hooray!
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, the bra boutique where I spend all Blake's
hard-earned money always does a proper sizing, of course.
Guess what size I am?  Go on, guess. You'll never guess.
38G.  Seriously.  Who the hell is a 38G?  That's just
silly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Colgate Luminous Toothpaste, Paradise Fresh flavour</strong>.  
I bought this because I had a coupon, and I liked the shiny
box.  At first I loved it; it's purple, it has little sparkles,
it comes out in a star-shape, it tastes faintly fruity.  It's
like toothpaste for a princess, apart from that you have to
squeeze it out yourself.  But
now I am annoyed because it's too foamy — it foams up
to, like, three times the volume of regular toothpaste within
about ten seconds, so you have to spit right away and start
over.  And the "clean cap" technology is a joke, in that way
of something advertised to have a particular characteristic
which then turns out to have quite the opposite characteristic.  
I have never had a toothpaste tube so encrusted with dried
toothpaste goo in my life.  I will not buy this pretty purple toothpaste again.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<a href="http://www.princelionheart.com/site/t_str_6550.html">Prince 
Lionheart Stroller Connectors</a></strong>.  This
is probably one of the worse baby-related purchases I have
made.  The theory is sound, but in reality the width of two
umbrella strollers plus the generous six inches of the
connectors is too wide to go through a standard door, so 
you can only use this on wide sidewalks or maybe in big
suburban malls, provided you're not going to actually go
into a store.  Also (and this is my own stupidity)
you're not suppsed to use the umbrella strollers for children
heavier than 30 lbs, and Delphine is only one pound shy of 
that now, so we won't be able to use this for long anyway.
Fortunately the connectors were only $20, so no great loss.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Chi-chi Foo Foo Manicure</strong>.  I bought my friend
Kathryn a manicure at a fancy upscale nail spa for her birthday,
and a couple of weeks ago we finally got around to going.
As a birthday present it worked out well; the experience
was fun and we got a chance to hang out.  As a manicure,
though, it was dismal.  I am quite capable of 
putting lotion on my own hands and filing my own nails;
the part I have trouble with is getting the nail polish
on really perfectly and having it stay on.  Sadly that
seemed to be the part these manicurists had trouble with
too: the polish job was shoddy and started chipping off
within a couple of days.  Also both Kathryn and I had
dirt under our nails (we both work with children!) and
they didn't clean them.  On the one hand it's kind of
creepy and gross to ask someone to clean your nails for
you, but on the other hand can you really call it a
successful manicure when your client walks away with dirty
nails?

<strong><em>How To Cut Your Own or Anybody Else's Hair</em> by
    Bob Bent</strong>.  This was indeed useful -- apparently the key to
    cutting your own hair is to cut a guide section in front
    and then match all the other hair up to that section, using
    lots of mirrors to see the back.  I'm pretty sure you 
    couldn't do a complicated style in this manner, but I expect
    it would work for a simple style if you could stand a
    few weeks of wearing the results of your own practice.
</p>
<p>
    Sadly some jerk decided to cut out the section on how
    to cut straight kid's hair (the straight hair of a kid, not
    the hair of a straight kid -- we don't know about that
    yet), which is of course the one thing I really wanted 
    the book for.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>On Bullshit</em> by Harry G. Frankfurt</strong>.  Of the
three bullshit books I have recently read, this is by far
the most successful, with a very intriguing conclusion.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Curse of the Narrows: The Halifax 
Explosion 1917</em> by Laura MacDonald</strong>.
I love a good disaster book, and this is a good disaster book.
I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had not tried
to read it on vacation, surrounded by a million distractions.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>False Alarm: The Truth About the Epidemic of 
Fear</em> by Marc Siegel</strong> approaches the current
American state of constant panic from a more medical point
of view.  I don't know if it's just me, or if it's all of
Canada, but I don't experience the kind of constant fear 
that he talks about, and I don't really know anyone who
does.  
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Undercover Economist: Exposing Why the Rich 
are Rich, the Poor are Poor--and Why You Can Never Buy a 
Decent Used Car!</em> by Tim Harford.</strong>  This is
a pretty interesting book about how economists think about
stuff (much like Freakonomics, but slightly less
amusing).  Harford leans a little further to the right
than I am used to, which got my back up a bit, but 
his arguments are convincing, so in the end I'm sure
it did me good.

Here I am in the most curious of situations; I have a
generally clean house and two sleeping girls.  I have
time on my hands.  I should spend it reading, because
I have books which a due back on Friday and which I
won't be able to renew because other people want them,
but on the other hand I should post here, because
clearly I have been neglecting this space.
</p>
<p>
About that...  a long, long time ago, I posted a big
whine about how I never do the things I want to do 
because I spend too much time watching television.  
Well, I am finally doing something about that.  Last
night I sat down and wrote down all the shows I 
<em>want</em> to watch (as distinguished from the shows
I watch because I am parked in front of the tv when
they are on) and what time they are on, and I don't
intend to switch on the television except at those
times.  (Unless I am checking the weather on channel
24.)
</p>
<p>
That should free up lots of time for reading, which
is good because I have forty books on hold at the
library.  And for posting here, which is good because
I miss it, and for reading my favourite discussion
board, which is really good because I really miss it.
</p>
<p>
Television isn't the only thing I am writing down;
I also started making four-week meal plans -- I 
come up with list of dinners, make a grand shopping
list and get Grocery Gateway to bring me everything
I will need.  Perishables I buy a week in advance.
It's awesome knowing what I am going to make for
dinner every day, and it's nice not to have to do
a big grocery shop every weekend.  Also it lets
me balance and control the amount of, say, beef
versus vegetarian meals we eat.
</p>
<p>
I'm also doing <a href="http://www.fitday.com">Fitday</a>
again, just to see whether I'm eating the right
amounts of things.  
</p>
<p>
Generally I seem to be seeking control over as
many aspects of my life as possible.  I don't
know why, quite, but I expect it has something
to do with the uncontrollability of babies and 
small children.  And more directly, I was getting
sick of my groundless feelings of helplessness
regarding, on the one hand, my failure to read
enough and on the other my failure to eat properly
and take care of myself.  Sitting around moaning
about your problems doesn't make them go away,
writing stuff down and getting on with it does.
At least if you're me.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, I feel (a little)
bad writing this much stuff
about myself; I feel like everyone comes here to
read about my children, not me.  Which is pretty
amusing considering I had an online journal long
before I had any children.
</p>
<p>
But more about me... we just got back from a
week in Saskatchewan visiting my parents.  It
was a nice time; we flew our kite, Delphine and
I went out in a boat, we ate lots of birthday
cake (Delphine turned three and my Dad turned
eighty-five while we were there), met new people.
My parents had a nice time with Delphine; my
mother was particularly amused by her constant
"Why"s.  We had fun coming up with good answers.
</p>
<p>
Now we're back home and everything is getting
back to normal.   These days, normal means
Delphine goes to daycare two or three days a
week, for the whole day.  She still enjoys it,
although she's been crying when we drop her off
since we got home from Sask.  I expect that will
pass soon.  The days she is in daycare, Cordelia
and I go for a long walk.  I do housework, I
amuse Cordelia, I cook and bake, I read.  
</p>
<p>
When Delphine
is home we generally don't stray far from home --
we might go to the park or to the convenience
store.  I do more housework but less baking, and
we read books, or do puzzles or play with 
playdough.  I don't get to read when Delphine 
is home because she bothers me to read to her
or play with her, except on the odd occasion
when both girls sleep at the same time.  Delphine
doesn't usually take a nap at home, although
I suspect she probably should.  (She usually
sleeps at daycare, they say.)
</p>
<p>
The girls have dinner at five and bedtime starts
at five-thirty.  If I am lucky everyone is in
bed by six-thirty, although it's more usually
around seven, and then Blake and I cook dinner
together.  We eat, we watch TV, we sleep, we
do it all again the next day.
</p>
<p>
On the weekends I get up when the girls do (six), 
and I let Blake sleep until seven-thirty or
eight.  Delphine and I make pancakes and eggs
one morning; the other morning we just have
cereal, and then after Blake wakes up we go
to the patisserie to get croissants and stuff
and the deli to get meat and cheese for 
brunch.  We go up to Eglinton to do errands 
(Shopper's, Dominion, bulk food, Future Shop),
grab a coffee on the way home.  That's our
weekend.  We're very domestic.
</p>
<p>
It's starting to feel a little crowded in our
condo -- Delphine is now sleeping in her bed
in our room, so that Cordelia can get used
to sleeping on her own before we move the two
of them together.  There really isn't room in
our bedroom for Delphine's bed, so I'm constantly
shimmying sideways to get past things.  
The toys are starting to take over the living
room, particularly the big things which can't
be hidden in boxes.  We have wagons and bikes
and strollers tucked away in every nook and
cranny.  And the kitchen is getting too small
-- there are multiple small appliances I am 
waiting on getting until we have a bigger
kitchen, not to mention the frustration of
only having space for one kind of rice.
(Chinese food with basmati is just weird;
ditto sticky rice with curry.)
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, we will have to put up with it
until next spring.  The plan, then, is that
I will get a part-time job which will bring 
in some extra cash, and we can then make an
informed decision about how much we can 
afford to pay for a house.  I have
a horrible fear that in the meantime our
neighbourhood will become massively trendy
and we won't be able to afford to stay here,
but I am willing to put up with a pretty crappy
house in order to stay close by, so I guess
it will work out in the end.
</p>
<p>
That's enough blather.  Cordelia is awake and
any moment now she will get tired of chewing on
my toes and go for the computer cables instead.

    <p>
...now with short reviews.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Accomodating Brocolli in the Cemetary or Why Can't Anybody Spell?</em>
    by Vivian Cook.  Fun, more list-y than I expected.  Good for reading on
    the crapper.</li>
<li>
<em>Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores The Hidden Side of 
    Everything</em> by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner.
    Thought-provoking, stats-based perspectives on just about everything.</li>
<li>
<em>One Summer's Grace: A Family Voyage Around Britain</em> by Libby Purves.
    I love Libby Purves.  I wish she lived next door to me and could come by
    for tea.</li>
<li>
<em>The Well-Ordered Home: Organizing Techniques for Inviting Serenity Into
    Your Life</em> by Kathleen Kendall-Tacket.  Apparently I already have
    a well-ordered home, because I didn't find anything particularly new
    in this book.  That is as I expected, and 
    not to say that wouldn't be useful to you, if you do not find your 
    home to be well-ordered.  (I only took it out because it's by one
    of the authors of the nursing book I just read, and I was curious.)</li>
<li>
<em>The Devil's Feather</em> by Minette Walters.  Minette Walters
    is always great, and this one was better than usual because she
    didn't spend so much time being bitter and miserable about the
    English.  This book ate an entire day of my life, which is pretty
    clever considering I am supposed to spend my days looking after 
    my children, not reading thrillers.</li>
<li>
<strike><em>The World is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century</em> by
    Thomas L. Friedman</strike>. I didn't finish this before it came due at the
    library; what I did get through wasn't anything 
    new to me, since it was mostly about
    the Internet revolution, and I was there studying or working in software
    when Netscape came out and when the web got big and Y2K and so on.  Towards
    the end of the book I think he gets into the social implications of the
    world being flat (ie, geography no longer being a limiting factor in
    the economy) but I didn't get to that part.  I wasn't sorry -- this was
    one of those books I read because I felt I ought to, not because I
    was really interested.</li>
<li>
<em>Willow and Twig</em> by Jean Little.  Loved this.</li>
<li>
<em>You Don't Have To Be Thin To Win: The Official Chub Club Coach's
    Workout Program</em> by Judy Molnar. Inspiring, if a little impractical --
    I am not about to train for a triathlon, or even a marathon; who has
    hours every day to work out?  (Having said that, I did put 
    Cordelia in the big stroller and go for an hour-long brisk
    walk today.  Like I said, inspiring.)</li>
<li>
<em>Goblin Market</em> by Christina Rosetti.  Why have I never
    come across this before?  Creepy and good -- I would love to see
    <a href="http://leontinemay.blogspot.com/">Leontine</a> illustrate
    this.</li>
<li>
<em>Goodnight Nobody</em> by Jennifer Weiner.  I wasn't sure about
    this at first because the protagonist doesn't really seem to like
    her children very much, but as it turns out she was just having one
    of those days, and also her husband was an asshole.  I can't imagine
    dealing with kids without a good, helpful, <em>present</em> husband
    at my side.  I think I would rather be not married at all than
    married to someone who was never home and not helpful when he was.
    But I digress.  (You have to read that in a South African accent,
    because I always say it with one in my head.  I'm not sure why.)
    Very fun book; I am happy Jennifer Weiner has written two more books
    I haven't read yet.</li>

    <p>
<strong>1. Square Meatballs.</strong>
</p>
<p>
I got this from <em>Better Baby Food</em>, which is my favourite cookbook
these days.  In the book it's a recipe but here I will just describe
the idea: square meatballs.  Instead of making little round meatballs,
which involves lots of time spent with your hands coated in raw meat
(not so good when the baby gets into the Choking Hazards), you pat
your meatball mixture in a thin layer (three-quarters of an inch?)
in a baking dish, and then bake them for twenty minutes at 350F.  Yes,
it's basically a thin meatloaf.  
</p>
<p>
After they are done, use a sharp knife to cut them into little squares
for the kids and bigger squares for the grown-ups.  Genius!
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. Thing</strong>
</p>
<p>
My in-laws make a dish called Zucchini Thing, which is really so
unlike anything else that the only possible name 
for it is Thing.  I have the recipe, but I am loathe to make anything
that calls for Bisquick.  To my delight, though, I found a recipe in
a magazine for the very same thing, except without Bisquick:
</p>
<p>
3 C grated zucchini<br>
1 small onion, chopped<br>
1 C all-purpose flour<br>
1 C grated provolone cheese<br>
3 eggs, beaten<br>
1/4 C vegetable oil<br>
4 T grated Parmesan<br>
2 t chopped fresh basil<br>
1 t baking powder<br>
1 t salt<br>
1/2 t black pepper
</p>
<p>
Mix it all together, slap it in a greased pie plate, cook it at 350F 
for 45 to 50 minutes or until golden brown, let it cool for 10 minutes,
and <em>voila</em>!  Thing!
</p>
<p>
The nice thing about Thing, though, is that it is forgiving.  Substitute
some other pureed vegetable for the zucchini (provided it is about as
moist as grated zucchini, which is pretty moist).  Stick some other
kind of cheese in!  And best of all, kids love it and it has three (3)
food groups.  Cut it into little squares and let 'em pick it up in
their fingers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. Chocolate charoset</strong>
</p>
<p>
I just made this up today.  I was making charoset for Passover dinner
tonight (I know, we're late) and I did it Sephardic style, in little
balls rolled in cinnamon.  After I had done a few I thought they looked
like truffles, and my mind wandered to truffles coated in cocoa.  "Hm."
I thought.  "I wonder..."  So I tried it, and they're really tasty.
Dessert charoset!

Jeez, I just typed out the names of the books I read since my 
last post, and it's clear I read too damn much.  Honestly, I don't
know where I find the time, so don't ask me.
</p>
<p>
(I remember when I was a kid I would say -- well, brag about, really --
how many books I read, and the mothers would look at each other and
roll their eyes and say "Well, I guess you have a lot of time!"  Hah!
Take this, snarky mothers!)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I have time to read them but not blog about them, so this
is going to be short.  Ish.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Akimbo and the Elephants</em> by Alexander McCall Smith</strong>
is also short, a little wee thing which I think took the author as long
to write as it took me to read.  It had a hurried feel, the characters
were thin, it was all a little obvious.  As if some elephant charity had
called the author and said "Write a nice little book about elephants!"
and he knocked it off in an afternoon.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>I Gave My Mom A Castle</em> by Jean Little</strong> is a 
wonderful collection of poems about families and gifts.  Little has
a knack for capturing children's thoughts and voices.  I remember 
enjoying her stuff when I was younger; perhaps now is a good time
to revisit it.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Père Goriot</em> by Honoré de Balzac</strong>
is one of my New Year's Resolution books, because it has a character
named Delphine in it.  It might even be the character that my Aunt
Delphine is named after, although naming your kid after this
Delphine seems like asking for trouble.  Anyway, Balzac is one
pessimistic bastard and almost everyone in this book is scheming
and dishonest, and those that aren't mostly get screwed in the end.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Breastfeeding Made Simple: Seven Natural Laws for
Nursing Mothers</em> by Nancy Mohnbacher and Kathleen 
Kendall-Tackett</strong> is an excellent book on nursing.  I got
it out so I could look it over and decide whether to recommend
it to a friend, but I ended up learning a bunch of stuff myself.  It
approaches nursing from the perspective of what's going on and
how you can make the natural process work for you, like growing
a seed, rather than giving a series of steps on How To Nurse, like
building an Ikea bookshelf.
</p>
<p>
I think this book should be recommended reading for every expectant
or nursing mother.
</p>
<p>
It also has a <a href="http://www.breastfeedingmadesimple.com/">fairly
tacky website</a> which might have some useful stuff in it.  Check
out that title!  Now that's professional!  (Ah yes: 
"&lt;meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 4.0"&gt;"
Always a good way to make a crappy impression.)
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Culture of Fear: Why Americans Are Afraid Of
The Wrong Things</em> by Barry Glassner</strong> is a nice,
reassuring book, in the sense that you don't really have to
be afraid of all the things the media would like you to be 
afraid of, but very unreassuring in that it give you 
the sense that people are very
stupid and can't seem to think for themselves.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Sir Charles: Wit and Wisdom of Charles Barkley</em> 
by Charles Barkley and Rick Reilly</strong>; Charles Barkley is
a pretty funny guy, in that he says stuff that everyone else is
scared to and he's usually right.  What I would give for this kind
of self-assurance.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Don't Get Too Comfortable</em> by David Rakoff</strong>.
Apparently if you are a good enough writer you can get someone
to pay you to do crazy stuff like visit a cryogenics lab, or fly 
the Concorde, or interview some dude at the Log Cabin Republicans,
just so you can write about it.  That's what this book is, and 
it's pretty funny and well-written and occasionally thought-provoking.
(I liked the part about the faux-poverty.)
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Understand Your Child's Growing Mind</em> by Christine 
Healy</strong> is another interesting, science-based book about
a parenting topic.  It's pretty dense, covering lots of ground
with respect to mental development, but readable.
I would recommend this to
anyone concerned with their child's intellect.  
</p>
<p>
The book has lots of 
neatly sidebarred tips on how to help prepare your child's mind
for reading, mathematics, etc.  Unfortunately if you added up
all the sidebars you would end up with about eight hundred
bulleted items, and if you tried to follow them you would never 
have time to brush your own teeth, you would be so busy massaging 
your kid's brain.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Dress Your Best</em> by Clinton Kelly and Stacy London</strong>
is basically <em>What Not To Wear</em> in book form.  It's divided
up by body type with tips for each type, but there are general tips
for everyone scattered throughout the book, so you have to read the
whole thing to get maximum utility out of it.  I managed to glean a
full page of tips from it, but sadly there was no five thousand dollar
credit card in the book, nor anyone to babysit for a week while I 
shop.  I guess looking fabulous is going to have to wait.

It's not a bad idea to go to the 
<a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpsclist.asp">CSPC</a> website and sign
up for their email notifications of product recalls.  Right now I
am obsessively staring at the page about  bracelets that came 
free with Reebok sneakers.  They have high lead content and a
four-year-old girl died from swallowing part of one.  I mean,
can you fucking <em>imagine</em>?

Incidentally there are lots of recalls for cheap dollar-store

If you are, perchance, looking for a hydrocortisone preparation,
perhaps for a rash which has mysteriously appeared on your
oldest daughter's hand, and you should happen to notice that
of the three preparations available, "cream", "ointment" and
"lotion", the lotion seems to be the best deal, you should 
know that said lotion is in fact largely composed of isopropyl
alcohol.  Whoever thought it was a good idea to sell ALCOHOL
to put on RASHES deserves some kind of Stupid award, which they
can share with me for buying it without reading the ingredients
list.  I am going to see if I can return it for a refund tomorrow.

First I want to say that the idea of this unsolicited 
advice is to publish things that I have learned through
my own experience that I did not read about elsewhere,
in books or in magazines, or that I read so many 
conflicting recommendations about that I might as well
have not read any.  I'm trying to avoid all the really
obvious stuff, or the stuff which is widely published.
But what I've learned is that all babies are
different, and what worked for me might not work for 
you, so take this for what it is; advice born from the
experience of one (well-read, intelligent) mother of
two (really easy) children.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Diaper cream</strong> is one of those things which
everyone has a different recommendation for, which leads
me to believe that different things work for different
babies.  All I have to say here is that diaper creams
which contain fish oil will make your baby smell like
a salmon cannery, and if you use cloth diapers they will
continue to smell fishy even after laundering.  Read 
labels carefully, and try all the other kinds of diaper 
cream first.
</p>
<p>
Okay, one more thing.  Johnsons 3-in-1 Diaper Cream and
Aveeno Diaper Cream have exactly the same ingedients and
are made by the same company, so buy the one that's on
sale.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p><strong>Bathing</strong> babies is something that I have
never quite figured out.  They're too big for the kitchen
sink (assuming your kitchen sink is clean enough anyway)
and too small for the tub, and I can't stomach spending
money on one of those in-bath baby holders (which Health 
Canada advises against anyway).  They're slippery as 
hell, they hate being bathed, and how dirty does a baby
get anyway?  I resolved the problem by just not
bathing my babies very often, until they're old enough
to sit up and manage the whole process more-or-less 
by themselves, as Delphine is.  And she still only gets
a bath twice a week.  Who has time for more?
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
This is probably too late for the unindentified target
for this advice, but perhaps not for you:  get yourself
a <a href="http://www.babytrekker.com/">BabyTrekker</a>.
They are so much better than the other comparable 
products I don't even want to go into it.  They are
way more comfortable, distribute the weight of the baby
much more sensibly over your body, and they carry up
to 40 lbs, which is considerably more than Delphine 
weighs at almost three years of age.  (I don't let her
go in the Trekker any more because I think it looks
silly.  I am so mean.)  Plus you can use them as a front
or backpack.  I love my Trekker.  I just wish they
had come out with the Tasteful Taupe model when we bought
ours; we have Fugly Forest Green.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
You're going to need to get yourself a <strong>5 ml
medication syringe</strong>. Lots of medications for 
babies come with 1 mL rubber bulb syringes, which not 
only make it hard to get the right dosage into the syringe
(and then into the baby),
but are often too small to contain the whole dose at
once.  For example, I needed to give Cordelia some 
Tempra, which comes with a 1 mL bulb dispenser, but
I needed to give her 1.25 mL.  That means I have to
go through the measuring part twice, AND the horribly
traumatic squeezing it into the unwilling child's mouth
part twice.  She's no slouch, and once she's learned that
the syringe means foul pink unction, the next part of the
dose is going to end up in her ear.
</p>
<p>
The good news is that some medications come with the
good kind of syringe (I think Tylenol is one of them)
so don't throw that out after the medication is done,
keep it in your first aid kit.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
Something more metaphysical to end (because Cordelia's
awake now).  I had trouble, with Delphine, understanding
that she is just a baby for a little while.  Intellectually,
of course, I understand that she's going to grow up, but
in some more primitive part of my brain it seemed that
every day of not enough sleep, too many diapers and no
time to do housework, let alone read, was just the first
day of thousands more of the same.  I guess, having never
watched a baby grow up before, I didn't really believe it would
happen.  And it makes sense; any changes in my life until
now I have effected through my own labour: I took a course,
or looked for a new job, or bought a new condo, or whatever.
I'm not used to standing by and watching my life change
outside of my own volition.

It's much easier with Cordelia.  When I have a horrible
day when all she wants is to be held all day, and I have
laundry and vacuuming and cooking to do and nothing is
getting done, I know that this is just temporary, that
eventually she will be able to walk and talk and play
by herself, and she won't need me every single minute.
That makes it much easier.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, it seems this is a hard lesson to learn;
I still have moments which I think the Delphine is going
to be a whiny, needy, contrary toddler forever, even
though I know, logically, that one day she will be a 
pleasant and helpful three-year-old.  I just can't
see how it will happen, because I haven't seen it 
happen before.
