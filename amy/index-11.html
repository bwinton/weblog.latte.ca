We just got home from a week at the cottage; at <em>a</em>
cottage, I should say, a place we (or more accurately, Blake's
parents) rented for a week up on Georgian Bay.  The cottage
was right on the beach, and we spent a restful week playing
in the water, sitting on the beach, eating corn and ice
cream and making sand castles.
</p>
<p>
The first day we were there Cordelia started standing on
her own, and she spent the rest of the week practicing;
she can stay up for about twenty seconds before she plops
down onto her bottom.  As soon as we got home we set her
up with Delphine's old push cart thing, and she loves to
zoom around with it (although she can't steer yet —
she goes in a straight line until she runs into something).
</p>
<p>
Delphine spent the week basking in all the attention
from her Baba and Zaida, and conquering her fear of
the water.  She's scared of pretty much everything
these days, so it was great for her to have an 
opportunity to confront something scary with the
support of such tireless cheerleaders.  And she
did great — by the end of the week she was 
happily walking into the lake by herself, jumping
over waves and playing in the water.
</p>
<p>
Blake and I had a nice week too, as you can imagine 
with two extra sets of hands around to help look after
the girls.  We both got lots of reading done, and 
we fit in a romantic walk on the beach and a nice
dinner as well.  
</p>
<p>
Delphine also went through a lot of books; I packed
a couple of Pooh books, a Stella and Sam book and
another library book with a watery theme.  Unfortunately
the cottage we rented came ready-stocked with some
crappy kids books which, of course, Delphine loved.
(I have heard from a couple of sources that children
will naturally gravitate towards quality books,
but Delphine certainly doesn't; some of her favourite
books are garbage and I have to "lose" them because
I can't bear to read them any more.)  Among a 
whole selection of
lousy books (and a couple of good ones; a Robert
Munsch and some Arthur books) at the cottage 
were picture-book-length adaptations
of <em>Disney's Aladdin</em>, <em>Disney's The Little
Mermaid</em> and <em>Disney's The Jungle Book</em>.
(Spotting a trend here?)  You can't really fit an
hour and a half of movie into thirty paragraphs, so
there was a lot of "Suddenly!" and sentences like
"Aladdin tricked
the genie into taking them out of the cave on a 
magic carpet," or "It took a lot of tricks for Baloo
and Bagheera to free Mowgli from the monkeys!"  
I don't remember the movies, but something
tells me that's at least fifteen minutes of film
and no small amount of characterisation and action
squeezed into one lousy little sentence. 
</p>
<p>
Delphine's favourite of those three was Aladdin.
Her favourite character was the genie, and her 
favourite line, which she repeated all
week, was "Proceed!  Touch nothing but the lamp!'  
which is a pretty great sentence when uttered
completely out of any context in a <em>very gruff</em>
voice by a three-foot-tall girl.  "<em>Proceed!
Touch nuffing but da lamp!</em>"
</p>
<p>
The girls each had their own bedroom at the cottage,
and the result of that was that they both slept
better; Cordelia was sleeping until 6:30 instead
of 5:30, and Delphine started sleeping until after
seven!  I am pretty excited about buying a house
now.
</p>
<p>
All in all, the week at the cottage was a success 
— we expect we will do it again next year,
even Blake who hates the great outdoors.  We will
probably try and get a nicer cottage next year; this
one was kind of, um, retro.

Tonight I did my first one-and-one — one minute of
running for each minute of walking — since my knee
injury healed.  (Previously I was doing two minute of
walking to every minute of running, so on average you
could hardly call it "running" at all.)  
It went pretty well, considering it was
thirty-two degrees with a Humidex of thirty-nine.  My 
knee was hurting a little bit, but I babied it and I'll
ice it tonight if I remember.
</p>
<p>
I noticed I'm not getting terribly out of breath on 
these runs, probably because I am running really slow.
I breath fast, but it's not that desperate, panting,
bile-taste-at-the-back-of-my-throat breathing I remember
so well from phys ed.  Ahh, phys ed.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, my friend Michelle, who was my real-life
inspiration to start running, is training for her first
half-marathon, and is documenting the whole gory process
on her 
<a href="http://30somethingrunner.blogspot.com/">running
blog</a>.  Michelle is in my choir, and we got to be
friends because she laughs at my smartass comments.
(Laughing at my jokes is a very short path to my heart.)
</p>
<p>
When I found out she runs I was a little surprised, 
because I always thought runners were kind of...
different.  Athletic.  Jockish.  That runners were
perhaps some entirely different species that I could
never fully relate to.  Since I was pretty sure that Michelle
is my kind of people, I had to reconsider my perspective
on runners, which made it possible for me to seriously
consider running myself.  And here I am, with Michelle
cheering me on.

It recently became obvious that Delphine doesn't need to go
to bed at six-thirty any more.  We put her to bed, bright-eyed
and fresh, and she sat up and read books, or popped
out at regular intervals to make contrived requests: "Mummy!
I need sumpin'."  "What do you need?"  "I need another buddy
(stuffed toy)."  Uh-huh.
</p>
<p>
Since we had been feeding her supper at five
and then making and eating our supper after she was in bed, we
couldn't really move her bedtime any later unless we included
her in our supper, which we have done.  She sits on the 
counter and watches while we cook, or joins in and helps;
yesterday she swished the lettuce around in the cold
water to rinse off all the delightful organic lettuce
goo.  And then she eats with us; we all sit at the 
big table and make conversation like a real family.  I'm
fairly excited about this — I think eating together
is one of the nicest things you can do as a family, and
I have been looking forward to this for a long time.
</p>
<p>
It kind of hoses our evenings, though.  When Delphine 
went to bed early we could tuck her in and then
eat supper in front of the television like slobs.  It's
an appalling habit, and I suppose it's good that we
don't do it any more, but it was very efficient and
allowed for plenty of TV-watching.  With Delphine 
in bed at 
seven-thirty or eight that only leaves us a couple of
hours to tidy the kitchen and watch TV before it's
time for bed, since I am trying to get into bed before
ten so I can get enough sleep before the Cordelia wake-up
call at five-thirty in the morning.  If you take away 
half an hour for a run and another twenty minutes for
an epsom salts bath, that barely leaves enough time for
last night's <em>Daily Show</em>.  I am turning into one of those
people who are too busy, even if it's only too busy
to watch television.
</p>
<p>
It also means I have to put together a good repertoire
of quick and easy meals, which I suppose is par for the
course for people with children.
</p>
<p>
Here's our evening routine, a snapshot of life with a baby and
a three-year-old:
</p>
<p>
<strong>4:30</strong> pick Delphine up from daycare (when applicable)<br><strong>5:00</strong> snack for Delphine and I, supper for Cordelia<br><strong>6:00</strong> Cordelia's bedtime — sometime between 6:00 and 7:00
Blake gets home from work<br><strong>6:30</strong> make dinner<br><strong>7:00</strong> eat dinner<br><strong>7:30</strong> Delphine's bedtime: pyjamas, pee, brush teeth, read
two books, watch two movies on Daddy's computer, bed<br><strong>8:00</strong> I go for run (three days a week) while Blake cleans
up after dinner (yeah!)<br><strong>8:30</strong> home for dessert and TV<br><strong>9:30</strong> bath and read a book<br><strong>10:00</strong> bed<br></p>

My knee is better.  On my chiropractor's* advice I went to see
a podiatrist to see if I have any functional problems with my
feet, and he didn't find anything.  He thought it was a
"weekend warrior" injury, which I find curiously flattering
since no-one has ever accused me of being in any way 
warrior-like before.  I think he's right, I just overdid it;
not only was I wearing the wrong shoes, but I was also trying
to run like a real runner when at this stage I should be
doing the old-lady-shuffle to get my body used to this
unprecedented level of physical activity.
</p>
<p>
I resumed running a couple of weeks ago, but I only managed
to go out a couple of times before we decided to switch
our evening routine around, which left me without a good
time to go out.  Blake and I talked about it, and finally
decided that the only time I can go is after dinner.  I was
reluctant to go out after a meal, but there is no other 
good option, as I will discuss in another post (if I have
time).  And it will encourage me to eat a lighter dinner,
which I could certainly stand to do.
</p>
<p>
Last night I went for my first postprandial run and it was
great.  I didn't really want to go — it is against my nature
to leave the house after seven at night — but
go I did.  I ran on the Beltline, an old rail track nearby which
has been converted into a trail, again on my chiro's 
recommendation because it's softer and easier on the 
joints than pavement.  I thought it would be boring
running the Beltline all the time, but I really enjoy
all the people I see; couples with little kids going
out for a walk after dinner; fat people like me trying
to get fit; trim, middle-aged rich women walking briskly
in pairs or groups; serious runners with expensive
gear; groups of teenagers on bikes; people out walking 
their dogs.  Yesterday I saw an old lady out for a
fitness walk wearing white shorts and a t-shirt, 
thin putty-coloured ankle socks and 
<a href="http://www.shoes.com/productimages/shoes_ib49552.jpg">plimsoll 
runners</a>, and no bra.  And I thought I would be
bored!
</p>
<p>
I am still doing two minutes of walking and one minute
of running, which is how they start you off in the
Running Room clinic.  When I got home last night I realized
it had been a pretty easy run, so next time I will step
it up to one-and-one.  
</p>
<p style="font-size:80%">
* While my chiropractor is technically a chiropractor, the
care she gives me is mainly something called 
<a href="http://www.activerelease.com/about.asp">Active
Release Techniques</a> which is basically very targeted
massage with movement, designed to loosen tight muscles
and break down scarring.  Since pretty much all my 
physical problems stem from tight muscles in my legs and
butt it works really well
for me.  I say this because I don't want you to think
I am dumb enough to go to a chiropractor for a sore
knee — I would no more do that than go to an opthamologist
for a sore elbow.

    <p>
Once upon a time, a long time ago, when Delphine was still
a baby, some friends wondered how a person who can barely
manage to feed themselves without a takeout menu
can manage to feed a child.  I used to think I would
be able to answer that question, but the fact is I
have become very domestic in the last few years; I
have a kitchen that is almost always clean enough
to cook in, I have multiple pans and knives, I have
a working dishwasher, I have enough staples on hand
to cook a dinner or bake a cake.  I even have a 
chest freezer. 
</p>
<p>
One day this could be you (well, maybe not the chest
freezer).  
The journey from urban restaurant forager to urban
chef has been one of many steps, and one of
them was having a child who needed good food, not 
just leftover pizza (although they still get that
sometimes).  So it may be that having to
feed your child properly is exactly the kick in the
pants you need to learn how to feed yourself properly too.
</p>
<p>
But that is neither here nor there -- what you need
to know right now, with your hungry six month old
on your knee, mouth agape, is how and what do I feed
her now?
</p>
<p>
Your first and best friend in this task is the boxed
baby cereal.  The one I always get is Heinz -- look
for one with as few extraneous ingredients as possible,
especially without milk or added formula.  
Lots of baby cereals have
milk in them; those cereals are for formula-fed babies
who have already been exposed to the 
hard-to-digest foreign proteins in cow's milk -- if
your baby is exclusively breastfed there is no need
to expose her to those proteins until she is ready for
them, in a couple of months.  So look for cereal that
just has grain, and probably a couple of vitamins,
in the ingredient list.  Get used to reading ingredient
lists -- you will be doing it a lot.
</p>
<p>
Start with rice cereal -- rice is the easiest grain
to digest.  If you're a champion pumper you can mix
it with breastmilk, otherwise use water.  You're
supposed to use boiled, cooled water -- I just used
whatever's in the bottom of the kettle from my last
cup of tea, which was never very long ago.   If you
trust your municipal water supply, after a while you
will just use tap water if you're lazy like me.
</p>
<p>
A little bit of cereal a couple of times a day is 
fine to start off with.  Remember, real food is just
recreational for now -- your baby gets all 
her nutrition from breastmilk (or formula) at this
stage, and will until she is a year old.
</p>
<p>
Do rice for a week, then try barley and oatmeal -- 
these are also very easy to digest.  If you are
brave enough to try them, you will find that the 
tastiest of the cereals is barley, despite being 
the unappetizing grey colour of <em>papier mache</em>.
</p>
<p>
You're supposed to wait four days or so between 
introducing new foods -- Cordelia is almost eight
months old as I write this, and I am introducing 
new foods at a manic pace of one a day or so.
You might be more conservative if you have any
concerns about allergies or if your baby is 
sensitive to new tastes and takes a while to get
used to them, or if you're just nervous.  
Whatever works for you.
</p>
<p>
After you have your baby nicely warmed up on
cereal, you can introduce fruits and veg.  My
doctor suggested doing orange, then yellow,
then green, but I think this whole process is
complicated enough without bringing the rainbow
into it.  Just introduce whatever you think would
be fun.  (See the chart I posted for ideas.)
</p>
<h4>Jarred Food or Homemade?</h4>
<p>
Both.  Jarred food is convenient, and you can get
good stuff.  You can even get organic if it's 
important to you.  Just, again, read the labels 
and don't buy anything with added sugar or starch.
If the jar says "Sweet Potato" the ingredient
list should say "sweet potato" and nothing else.
Use your good sense.
</p>
<p>
Two things to avoid: jarred banana tastes weird
because it's cooked, so it actually has that
fake banana taste, and also, how hard is it to
mash up a banana with a fork?  Buying jarred banana
is just embarrassing.  And jarred green beans 
are sour and horrible -- homemade green beans
aren't nice either; they just don't puree well.
Green beans can wait until your baby has learned
how to chew.
</p>
<p>
But homemade baby food is nice, too -- there
are lots of fruits and vegetables that you 
can't get jarred -- okra?  asparagus?  mango?
And there's a warm, fuzzy feeling to feeding
your baby something you have made with your
own hands.
</p>
<p>
How to make homemade baby food?  This is the
easiest way: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>open a bag of frozen peas</li>
<li>dump some in the beaker that came with your
hand blender (You do have a hand blender, don't
you?  How do you make milkshakes?)</li>
<li>Pour in just enough water to cover the peas</li>
<li>put a saucer over the top of the beaker</li>
<li>stick it in the microwave for a few minutes,
    until the water boils and the peas get
    a little bit soft</li>
<li>drain off the water</li>
<li>blend the peas into mush</li>
</ol>
<p>
Put some in a bowl, wait until it cools, serve.
Put the rest into those little one-cup or half-cup
Gladware containers and freeze.  (Everyone says to
use ice cube trays, but they are a pain in the
ass, and my kid easily eats a quarter-cup at a
sitting, which is way more than one ice cube.)
</p>
<p>
You can do the same with other frozen vegetables,
or frozen or canned fruit (you don't have to microwave
the fruit, obviously).  If the resulting puree 
is too runny, add some of the dry baby cereal to
thicken it.
</p>
<p>
If you have a clean knife and cutting board kicking
around, you can do much the same thing with any
fresh vegetable or fruit (with the exception of
berries and tomatoes, which can be allergenic).  
If you prefer, cook it in a 
pan on the stove, if you have a clean pan and your
stove works.
</p>
<p>
Get someone else to clean up, you have done enough.

    Here's a chart I made up for myself, based mainly on
information from the book <em>Better Baby Food</em>.
I stuck it up on my bulletin board in the kitchen and
I have been using it as a checklist to figure out what
Cordelia has tried so far, and what she's ready for
next.

Now that both England and Brazil are out of the World Cup
finals I'm having a hard time getting excited about the
last few games.  At least Italy are in; they are always
a useful second backup after Brazil, but while I am glad
to see them play, I don't really care all that much whether
they win or lose.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's hard watching football around here.  Watching a 
football match properly calls for a degree of attention
that is impossible while you are making sure that Child 2
isn't choking on some abandoned crayon, and at the same
time reading Pooh (with all the right voices) to Child 1.
So mostly it's been on as background noise for the last 
month, a screen saver for the television.  It's the most
TV Delphine has ever watched, I think.  We talk
about where the players come from, and what their names
are.  (Delphine now knows that Germany is a country.)
</p>
<p>
I will be sorry when it's all over; I have tried being
interested in league football, but I just don't care,
and even the Euro Cup (or whatever it's called) isn't
all that interesting.  You have to have the little 
African countries to root for, and the wonderful 
South Americans.  So I'll put my fan hat away until 
2010, when Delphine will be seven and Cordelia
will be three and a half -- older than Delphine is
now.  (Last World Cup we had no children at all!)  And
maybe next time England will win...

I realized today why my injured knee has been bothering me
so much, emotionally.
It's because that horrible little man, that man who lives
in the back of my head and who I thought I had banished
forever, is dancing with glee.  He is dancing with glee
and hissing "You see?  I told you!  I told you you are too
fat to be a runner!'
</p>
<p>
Shut up, nasty little man, and crawl back in your hole,
because my knee feels better today and I will run again.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
Okay, you know the other thing that pisses me off
about this?  (Soon I will stop going on about this,
I promise.)  Blake decided that he was going to
ride his bike up to Balm Beach, like, 135 kilometers, 
and you know what,
I bet he is going to do it.  But <em>I</em> decide 
I am going to start running
and not two weeks into it I am couch-bound with a stupid
injury!  This after I had to give up hot yoga 
because of my back!  It's like every time I try and
get fitter something fouls it up.
</p>
<p>
How come everyone else can do this stuff and I can't?
Waah!
</p>
<p>
I know, welcome to my pity party.  I hope that eventually
this will just be a humourous anecdote about the 
inauspicious start to my long running career.  There I will
be, cocktail in hand: "I had only been running for
a week -- I had been out three times! -- and there
I was with an injured knee!  Ha ha!  Can you believe
it!  Well, then I got proper shoes and 
here I am, three marathons later!  Incredible!  
Ha ha ha!  Pass the olives!"

    <p>
A couple of weeks ago, after I read that Silken Laumann book,
I realized that I no longer had any excuse not to take a
running clinic at The Running Room.  
I had thought for a while about taking a clinic, thought about it, 
planned to do it at some unspecified point in the future...
and suddenly I realized that that point was now.
Cordelia is old enough
that she can be away from me for a while, and Blake is
more than willing to look after her and Delphine
while I go out running.
</p>
<p>
So I signed up for the Learn To Run clinic, a ten-week
program that promises to take the slobbiest
slob and render them capable of running a 5K.
I dug out
my old running shoes and showed up 
the first Saturday, 8:30 in the morning.  
I was full of energy, keen
to go, had been up for hours already!  I ran, I walked,
it was great, it was easier than I thought, I loved
being out in the fresh air first thing in the morning
before all the crowds.  I went for a practice run 
that Monday,
and then for a bike ride with Blake on Thursday.  
I was feeling 
good, healthy, my back was feeling looser and
less painful than it had in years.
</p>
<p>
Okay, my knee was a little sore on the bike ride,
but hey!  My knees are always a little sore!
Arthritis, right?  Getting some exercise and losing
weight will only help, right?  So I went to the clinic
and ran again -- it was still good, but a little harder
this week.  Oh, and they mentioned that you should 
really get new shoes after you have babies because
your feet change.  Oh.
</p>
<p>
By then my knee really hurt, but I walked
the twenty-minute walk home, then back up to the
store again later that day to buy new shoes, and
home again.  (I am really stupid.)
</p>
<p>
My knee still hurt by Wednesday -- all the time,
whether I was walking or running or just sitting -- 
so I went to see my physical therapist.  And as
it turns out, I have injured the cartilage in my
knee and I won't be able to run for at least a
couple of weeks, if ever.  (The "if ever" part
we will find out through a process of trial and
error, lucky me.)  
</p>
<p>
And in the meantime, I have to stay off my feet
as much as possible;
no trip to the store, no
trip to the library to pick up the books I have
on hold there.  It's a blessing that
Starbucks is just across the street, that's all
I say.  The irony is that I started this trying to
get fit, and here I am more sedentary than ever.
</p>
<p>
Oh woe, oh woe, but at least I am not dead.  
(A friend of a friend was killed in a horseback
riding accident last weekend, a timely reminder
that it could always be worse.)
