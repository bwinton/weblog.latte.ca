(Michelle, you should maybe skip this post in light of our conversation
re: passing out during an episode of ER.)
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, as I was shuffling, shoeless about the house (as usual) I stabbed
my foot on a splinter.  Crap, I thought, that hurts; but I was in the middle
of preparing supper for the girls so I carried on, and in a lull in the
cooking I got my tweezers and tried to pull the splinter out so I
could get on with my evening.
</p>
<p>
The splinter didn't come out; I couldn't get a good grip on it with
my shiny red Tweezerman slanted tweezers while I was hopping around
on one foot, so I brought a dining room chair into the kitchen 
(where the light is best) and sat down.
</p>
<p>
Once, twice, three times I pulled and somehow always lost my grip on
the splinter before I got it out.  Finally I really dug those pointy
Tweezerman corners into my foot, pinched the splinter as tight as I
could and pulled hard.  
</p>
<p>
To my horror what I had thought was a little sliver
turned out to be an inch-long spear of hardwood floor.  I immediately 
started 
bleeding all over the floor, great big bright red drops, so I grabbed 
a tea towel off the stove
(there's a good reason to make sure you get a fresh tea towel out
every day; if you injure yourself at least you know there's at most
a day worth of crap on the first towel that comes to hand) and applied
pressure with one hand while calling for backup with the
other.  Fortunately Zaida was only a couple of minutes away so 
he came right over to help with the girls' supper while I bandaged
myself up and cleaned the kitchen floor.
</p>
<p>
That was yesterday.
</p>
<p>
Last Tuesday, I woke up in the middle of the night with the most
excruciating pain I had ever had (although bear in mind I didn't
go through labour, so this could be nothing compared to that).
It felt like someone was punching me all over my chest and back.  It
went on for ten or fifteen minutes and was gone as soon as it had
come.  It came again on Thursday morning (there's just something
especially cool about lying on the floor in agony while your three-year-old
tries to figure out what to do with herself -- Mummies aren't supposed
to get sick!) so on Friday I went to the doctor.  She thinks I
might have gallstones, so I am getting an ultrasound this Friday to
check it out.
</p>
<p>
While I was at the doctor she informed me that those red bumps on my
belly which I thought were maybe bites or something are actually
shingles,
for which she gave me a prescription for a week's worth of blue
horse pills, anti-virals, and an exhortation to rest.  (I laughed,
and offered to let her come over and look after Cordelia and pack
while I rested.)
</p>
<p>
So to recap: gallstones, shingles, and a bloody great hole in the
bottom of my foot.  It made yesterday's application for life insurance
a barrel of fun, for sure.  Well, Blake laughed a lot anyway.

I know, it has been weeks since I posted.  If it makes you feel
any better, I haven't written any email either.  It's not so much
that I've been busy as I've been in a state of frozen panic, 
afraid to do anything that isn't related to real estate lest I
break the fragile thread that is holding together all these transactions
and agreements and unimaginably large sums of money.
</p>
<p>
But our real estate agent just called to say that all the documents
and amendments and waivers have been signed and everything is
going to go ahead, really truly, pinkie-swear.  It's real.
</p>
<p>
I'm not excited about the new house.  Actually, there is almost
nothing I am looking forward to about the new house; I am not
looking forward to climbing up and down stairs, I am not looking
forward to doing laundry in the basement, I am not looking forward
to hand-washing dishes, I am not looking forward to a bathtub with
no shower, I am not looking forward to being miles (okay, blocks)
away from the nearest Starbucks.
</p>
<p>
It is almost comical how this house doesn't add up. We made a 
wish list before we went house hunting:  big kitchen — not
really; two bathrooms — nope; big deck — nope; 
detached — no; shower — shower?!  I didn't <em>put</em>
"shower" on my wish list, because what house doesn't have a
shower?  Well, mine.
</p>
<p>
And yet I still love the house, our little tiny dark house, because
it is ours and we can do whatever we want with it; we can reno the
kitchen, we can add a room at the back (if the neighbours don't
mind — please don't let the neighbours mind), we can dig out
the basement and put in a laundry room and a den and a nice bathroom
with a crazy Japanese tub, we can fix up the bathroom upstairs,
we can add a big deck and a patio and do beautiful landscaping in
the front.
</p>
<p>
We're planning, soon after we move in, to add about fifteen feet
to the back — the kitchen is now at the back of the house,
and we are going to move the kitchen into the additional space
and put a kind of office slash play area where the kitchen is now.
(That's if we can afford it; we haven't had a quote from the
contractor yet.)  
</p>
<p>
We're going to put in new pale wood fifties-style 
fitted cabinets, a modern gas
stove (sorry, but the old stove is going; I will try and find a good
home for it), a new fridge, a dishwasher, a forties-inspired 
white subway tile backspash,
fifties-style blue countertops and blue linoleum on the floors.  We're
keeping the original sink and the white painted cabinet with the
amazing handles and hinges.  The office will house our fifties metal
desk and a set of fitted cabinets, matching the ones in the kitchen,
to house jackets and boots and things, as well as providing more pantry
space.  
</p>
<p>
Stylistically it's going to be, frankly, a retro pastiche combining
Deco elements from the forties with Moderne and Contemporary influences
from the fifties, and of course a few current pieces like the appliances
and lighting.  
Since Moderne and Contemporary are (ironically,
linguistically speaking) pretty much opposite, I have no idea if it
will work.  I am hoping it will kind of blend, organically.  I mean,
if it were 1956 and you had been living someplace for a while, you would
probably have all those elements in your home.  We'll see.  I figure after
it's been there for a few years and gotten bashed around a bit 
it will look fine.  And I will be used to it and won't care.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
What I am looking forward to is the location, which is the one thing
you can't add to a house.  The new house is halfway between the street
with the library, two patisseries, a bulk food store and a really nice
kids' clothing store, and another street which houses bakeries, 
butchers, a cheese store, a second-hand kids' stuff store, a new
kids' stuff store, two ice cream parlours, a drugstore and of course
Starbucks.  And by halfway, I mean less than ten minutes walk to either
street; maybe five minutes.
</p>
<p>
The bus stop is right on the corner, about three houses away, and the
bus comes every ten minutes.  And if you can't wait, it's only about
a ten or fifteen minute walk to the subway.
</p>
<p>
The block is also thick with children; there are about a dozen houses
on the block and all but maybe one or two have children.  The school
is an easy walk away, and it's one of the best in the city.  So, you
know, it could be worse.

The condo is on the market, and has been for a couple of weeks, 
which means my entire life is dedicated to cleaning and tidying.
It's boring and has convinced me that it will never be worth my
time to have a perfectly clean and tidy house in real life,
However, I have learned a thing or two.
</p>
<p>
First, it is actually worthwhile to sweep every day.  I always thought
daily sweeping was the province of the obsessively clean, but now
I find out that sweeping the kitchen, bathroom (the one with the
kitty litter box) and front hall yields an impressive pile of crud,
every single day.  Huh!
</p>
<p>
I also suspect (although this is only a hypothesis
for now) that sweeping the bathroom every day would prevent the build-up
of that layer of linty, hairy crud behind the toilet -- no lint and hair,
no buildup!  That would be nice.
</p>
<p>
And second, I have learned that the cats only use their litter box
overnight, which I suppose follows from that whole nocturnal
thing.  That means that if you clean out the box in the morning,
you're good to go for the rest of the day.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
For some reason I was expecting the condo to move really quickly, and
so earlier this week Blake and I were pretty dispirited that it 
hadn't.  I was poking around the place trying to figure out what the
problem was... stains on the carpet?  Floors need refinishing?  Cheap
closet doors?  Cursing the lazy builders who didn't bother to actually
square off the walls.  But I've now decided that the right person 
just hasn't come through yet; when you have a good location and
high ceilings and big windows
and a view like ours, carpets and floors and doors fade into insignificance.
(Obviously, or we would have fixed them by now ourselves.)
When someone comes along with the right budget and the right priorities
the place will sell, we just have to wait for that someone.

On Saturday I did a surprisingly easy 5K of ten and ones —
surprising because I ran exactly  no times the week before.  I 
guess some rest is what the doctor ordered.
</p>
<p>
Last night I went out in the drizzle and did another 2.5K of
ten and ones, and I thought about why I like running outside 
rather than in a treadmill: every time you go out, it's a 
new run, even if you are running the same old route.  Running
in rain is different from running in sun, is different from
running in snow is different from running three days after
it snows.  Running uphill is different from running downhill,
running on gravel is different from running on pavement is
different from running on asphalt.
</p>
<p>
When you run on a treadmill the best you can hope for is that
the Seinfeld repeat is one you haven't seen lately.

I just got back from a 2.3K run of eight and ones.  It was hard;
I am still a little wheezy and having trouble catching my breath.
But I am quite pleased with myself for doing it; it was already
8:30 by the time I went out, and I really wanted to stay home
and sit on the couch.  We have our
condo on the market (anyone want a condo?) and I have spent the
last week cleaning and tidying like a fool instead of running
and sleeping and doing other sensible things.
</p>
<p>
I haven't been keeping up with the homework for the Learn To
Run clinic; you are supposed to run three times a week but
I have only gone once this week and it's already Thursday
(clinic meets on Saturday).  This week we are doing 4.75K of
nine and ones and I am going to be suffering.  Hopefully, though,
now that the condo is clean and tidy I will be able to get back
to three runs a week.
</p>
<p>
And hey, back in June when I started all this foolishness I
wouldn't even have been able to <em>think</em> of running for
eight minutes without stopping.  So that's something.

So.  We bought a house.  Yeah.
</p>
<p>
It's little.  It's dark.  It's a semi-detached and it is about four feet
away from the other neighbour, the one who isn't attached.  It hasn't
been renovated for twenty years; it is very much like a time capsule.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, it has been impeccably maintained; the paint is 
perfect, the woodwork is flawless, and it's spotless.  It wasn't 
terribly much money (for the area) so we will have a little extra
to do urgent fix-ups (hello, dishwasher?)  It is on
an amazing street in a perfect neighbourhood in exactly the location
I wanted.  It has a 180-foot-deep lot so we have miles of backyard,
which means we can add additions and decks and patios on the
back and <em>still</em> have room for a garden and playhouse for the 
girls.  And a circus tent.  And a helicopter pad.  It has three
big bedrooms and a big kitchen.

I feel strangely deflated now that my first run is behind me,
although I have another month to go in my running clinic to give me
something to work on.  (We are doing eight and ones next
weekend; how I am going to go from five and twos to eight and ones
I do not know).
</p>
<p>
I think I will sign up for a 5K sometime this winter or early 
spring to keep me honest over the winter and give me something to 
aim for: I 
would like to improve my time by running for a larger proportion
of the time.  I will need some kind of external incentive because
I can really see myself forgetting about running altogether in
the chilly winter evenings.  Although I bet Michelle wouldn't let
me.
</p>
<p>
In the summer of '07 I will do two or three 5Ks, then
maybe another over the winter (if I feel like I need it to keep
my momentum up).  Then in '08 I'd like to do the Sporting Life
10K (because it's mainly downhill!) and the 10K in the zoo
(because the zoo is cool).
Maybe by '09 I'll be ready for a half-marathon, or maybe I will
do a couple more 10Ks, and do a half-marathon in '10... we'll see.
</p>
<p>
Of course this could be derailed by unforseen circumstances, but
so could any plan; no reason not to make it!

I did it, I finished my first run!  I did the Scotiabank Toronto
Waterfront 5K in 42 minutes, doing
intervals of two minutes of walking and five minutes of running.
It was a good pace, fairly challenging but not so hard that I felt
like I wasn't going to make it.
</p>
<p>
It was cool to run in a real race, although there was a marked
difference between the 5K and the "real" races; we had little
kids, people with special needs, people who clearly intended to
amble the route (not that there's anything wrong with a nice
amble, but I'm not sure I'd choose Lakeshore for it).  There
was even a woman enjoying a nice, bracing cigarette before the
race began!  But hey, it was a good start and I'm really glad I
did it.
