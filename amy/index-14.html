So yeah, running.  I haven't been.  For a while there we 
were in a crazy deep freeze the likes of which I moved out of
the prairies to avoid, and then I hurt my back, and... oh,
I don't know, there's always something that comes up.  
Dishes!  Dishes are the last straw for me, it seems; I can
manage to do the housekeeping and look after the kids and
go to choir and run and read and stuff when I have a dishwasher,
but when I have to do dishes by hand it all goes to hell.  How
do we generate so many dirty dishes?
</p>
<p>
I did do a tortuous and pathetic 3K last weekend, which is
better than the nothing I have done since.
</p>
<p>
But I think I'm okay with a winter lull.  I would like, ideally,
to run through December, just to counteract the holiday madness
both psychologically and healthwise, but I don't think I would
be too devastated if I took a break from running every January
and February.  It's hibernation time.  That's long enough, though.
Once March comes I will set a schedule and work towards running
5K straight through without a walking break.

If I had one of those blogs with a "mood" field, I would write
"bummed" and put a little sad face.  I just poked around the
Queens and OISE (Ontario Institute for Studies in Education) 
websites and found out that because I got such crappy marks in
university I don't qualify to get into their teacher education
programs.  I have no idea what I should do about this -- do I
have to get another degree?  Go to someone's office and beg?
</p>
<p>
It's extra ironic because I have a three year degree, so according
to Queens that means I need a B average, but if I had a four year
degree they wouldn't even care what my marks are.  
However, the reason my marks are
so bad is that I was taking Honours (four-year) courses, which are
harder than the three-year program courses.  If I had been taking
three-year General courses I would have been getting As and Bs
instead of Cs and Ds.  And Fs.
</p>
<p>
Also ironic because
I am smart and I would make a good teacher (I think), and university
was a million years ago — since then I have worked, travelled,
become a parent — and how well I did or didn't do back then
is so irrelevant to how well I would do as a teacher now, ten 
years later, that I am frankly shocked and taken aback that it would
even come up.  But they don't have any options for mature students;
I am bound now by bad decisions I made when I was eighteen.  Still.
Again.
</p>
<p>
Stupid.  I guess I will have to go meet with a registrar and see
if they have any bright ideas.

We have finally beaten the house into enough submission that I
can sit down and read a few pages in good conscience, thank
god.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Another Day in the Frontal Lobe: A Brain Surgeon
Exposes Life On The Inside</em> by Katrina Firlik</strong> is
the autobiography of a neurosurgeon.  It's well-written and
interesting if you're like me and are fascinated by the workings
of the human body and the freaky things that happen to it.
Sometimes I wish I had done something more brainy in university,
and that I was something more impressive now, like a Doctor or
a Lawyer (not really), but this book made me glad I'm not a
neurosurgeon, or really any of the emergency-oriented
medical specialities.  I love my easy, predictable, homey
life and I would hate to work long hours and be on call all
the time.  Although the saving people and being really important
part would be cool.
</p>
<p>
I went to <a href="http://www.katrinafirlik.com/">Katrina Firlik's
website</a> and found these 
<a href="http://www.katrinafirlik.com/drawings.htm">funny little
drawings of 
neurosurgery-related objects juxtaposed with objects in nature</a>.
Also the UK title for this book, <em>Brain Matters: Adventures 
of a Brain Surgeon</em>, is a hundred times better than the
North American title.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Cockeyed: A Memoir</em> by Ryan Knighton</strong>
is another autobiography, this one by a guy who started going blind
in his teens and is now completely or almost completely blind.  It
chronicles the hijinks that ensue when you mix normal teenage
stupidity with unreliable eyesight, when you get a bunch of
blind people together at Blind People Camp (blind Tai Chi, anyone?
Blind canoeing?), and the deep, deep badness of going to
South
Korea to teach English with your girlfriend and pretend you're
not blind.
</p>
<p>
This book made me laugh until I wept; I could hardly tell Blake
what I was laughing at.  Knighton is a brilliant writer and has
a real knack for describing the inherent slapstick of blindness,
without making you feel like an asshole for laughing at it.
He is also unflinchingly honest about his own behavour and
emotions, and the effect he has on others.
I think I will try and find other stuff he has written and see
how he deals with other material.  I hope he has children and
writes about them, actually, because I bet that would be
hilarious.

Since I last posted I have started making notes on the books I
read in an old-fashioned paper-and-pen notebook, which is part
of the reason I haven't posted about books; I feel like I've
thought about the books quite enough between reading them and
then making notes, I don't really want to face them again in
the blog.  So I am trying to decide if I should give up blogging
about books at all.  On the one hand I feel as if books are 
the only thing of substance I write about, and I sort of
like putting my reading list out there and sharing the finds
and the books to avoid; I know there is at
least one person who gets ideas about books to read from my
list.  On the other hand I
don't know if anyone else particularly cares what I read and
what I think about it, so maybe it's not worth blogging about
and I should stick to the paper book log.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, all that aside I would like to write about what I
read in the rest of 2006, for completeness.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Baby Project</em> by Sarah Ellis</strong> is a
young adult novel about a teenage girl who gets an unexpected
baby sister, and how the new addition pulls the family apart 
and together. 
</p>
<p>
SPOILER: Of course there is the obligatory 
tragedy which forces everyone to confront their demons and
become better people. Tragedies in young adult fiction often
seem to heavy-handed and morose and obvious.  "We must
have something terrible happen to these people to move the
character development forward."  As opposed to the tragedy
happening because tragedies happen, which I suppose happens
in life, but I feel like fiction should be a little more sensible.  
I don't know how an
author finesses that fine line of having things happen to move
the novel forward without it being obvious that <em>this thing
is happening to move the novel forward</em>, but it's nice when they manage
it.  Which Ellis didn't here, but otherwise it's a good story
with well-drawn characters.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Reading Series Fiction</em> by Victor Watson</strong>
seemed like a nice complement to the book about reading like a professor.
It's about series fiction for children, which apparently is an
under-studied genre in the world of children's literature.  Watson
gives a nice overview, with lots of analysis of various series, 
as well as effectively skewering Enid Blyton.  This is a must-read
for anyone who is interested in children's literature.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Confessions of an Organized Homemaker</em> by Deniece 
Schofield</strong> is a book about how to get organized.  I can't
remember the layout or concept of this book, but I wrote down a 
bunch of good ideas from it, like keeping jigsaw puzzle pieces
in big Ziploc baggies and getting rid of the boxes (which always
fall apart, don't stack nicely and generally make life hard); keeping
all dry ingredients (flour, baking soda, rice, etc) in Tupperware 
containers which stack neatly, rather than in the original packaging
(of course I use cheap and cheerful Gladware instead).  
This was a useful book with lots of similar good ideas.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Johnny Kellock Died Today</em> by Hadley Dyer</strong>
is a young adult novel set in Halifax in the fifties.  I don't remember
much about this apart from a favourable impression and appealing
characters, and another tragedy but a much more finely drawn and
subtle one.  
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Stumbling on Happiness</em> by Daniel Gilbert</strong>
is a book about what makes people happy.  This is very nicely
written; I enjoyed reading it not just for the content but
for the author's voice.  It's an interesting book about
where happiness comes from, what makes us happy, how we deal with
tragedy, and how to make decisions that will make us happy in
the future.    It's probably a good idea for everyone to read this
book.  Everyone who wants to be happy, anyway.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Car and the City</em> by Alan Thein Durning</strong>
is an overview of how cars and cities work together, or rather
how they don't work together, and how we can create cities which
improve our lives and lessen our dependence on cars (which are
pretty much synonymous in  my mind).  Useful book, easy to read.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Children of Green Knowe</em> by Lucy Boston</strong> and
<strong><em>Autumn Term</em> by Antonia Foster</strong> are both discussed
in the aforementioned <em>Reading Series Fiction</em> book.  <em>Green
Knowe</em> is about a little boy who is sent to live with an ancient
relative in a spooky old house, and the friends he makes there; 
<em>Autumn Term</em> is an excellent representative of the English
Boarding School genre.  Both are very good and I will suggest the
girls read them when they are older.
</p>
<p>
I did not finish
<em>Allergy: History of a Modern Malady</em> by Mark Jackson.  I thought
it would be more chatty, more lighthearted, but it turned out to be a 
dense discussion of the history of allergies in medicine, and I gave up
after a couple of chapters.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Blue Shoes and Happiness</em> by Alexander McCall Smith</strong>
and <strong><em>Cold Moon</em> by Jeffrey Deaver</strong> were good
easy reading.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The March of Unreason: Science, Democracy and the New
Fundamentalism</em> by Dick Taverne</strong> is a really nice comparison
of anti-scientific doctrines and beliefs with the old religious
fundamentalism. Taverne discusses the role of the media and 
post-modernist thought in the mongering of fear of such diverse
bugaboos as multinational companies, pesticide, genetic modification,
and modern medicine.  His arguments are sound and this book is very
thought-provoking.  It's also nice to think that one doesn't have to
go around being scared and cynical all the time.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Kindred</em> by Octavia Butler</strong> is an awesome 
book.  It's about a modern (well, seventies) black woman who is
sent back in time to the slavery-era South to save a white man who
will become her ancestor.  Imagine the best possible book with that
scenario, and that's what Butler has written.  I am glad to have 
found this author because she wrote a lot, and you know I am always
running out of things to read.  
</p>
<p>
I didn't read <strong><em>Blink</em> by Malcolm Gladwell</strong> because
I wanted to, but because every else in the world has read it and I
felt left out.  I'm glad I did, though, because it's interesting and
Gladwell is always a pleasure to read.  It's more of that same brain
stuff like in <em>Stumbling on Happiness</em> and <em>The Paradox
of Choice</em>, and the more I know about how the brain works
the more in control I feel, and the more I understand about the
world.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Fourth Horseman</em> by Andrew Nikiforuk</strong> was
really disappointing.  It's a book about plagues and pandemics, and I
love a good plague.  One of my favourite units in History was on
the Black Death.  But in my notebook I wrote "A discussion of various
plagues and pandemics through the ages, fatally marred by the author's
disdain for doctors, technology, and facts."  It's a weird book;
at one point Nikiforuk talks with disgust about how underwear was
originally worn to protect more valuable outer garments from body
soil.  Isn't that why we wear underwear now?  I mean, except
Paris Hilton, for whom outerwear <em>is</em> underwear.  He also
goes into a wistful reverie about the good old days when half of
children born didn't make it to age five, and old people were 
really respected because there weren't so many of them.  He speaks with
disdain about the "germ theory" of disease, the radical theory
that microorganisms are the cause of many diseases.  And a cornerstone of
modern medicine.  I think Nikiforuk is a kook in journalist's 
clothing; this book was a jarring contrast the <em>The March of
Unreason</em>.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Little People: Learning to See The World Through My 
Daughter's Eyes</em> by Dan Kennedy</strong> is a book by the father
of a little girl born with achondroplagic dwarfism, about his 
journey to understand why she was born different and what that
means for her future and for the world she will live in.  It was
an interesting book and a good read.  It was also fun to read the
bits about the Roloffs, because I know you watch <em>Little People,
Big World</em> every week like I do.  Or at least you should.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Break No Bones</em> by Kathy Reichs</strong> is better
than the last one — she's back to her usual formula and it's
working.  Although I hope she resolves this husband/boyfriend love
triangle thing, it's starting to drag on.
</p>
<p>
So that was a lot of books and it took me a really long time to
write about them; was it worth it?  I don't know; I'm just really
tired.

    <p>
People keep asking me if we're getting settled in,
and until today I was getting pretty tired of it,
because I really didn't feel all that settled.
Today, though, we moved a bunch of boxes out of
the living room and laid down the rug, cleared
the upstairs landing, and unpacked a couple of
big bins, and now it finally does feel like we're
getting settled, like this is really where we 
live and not just where all our stuff is.
</p>
<p>
Of course we still have a million things to
unpack, but we have been cleverly hiding boxes
in the basement rather than face them, and we
are managing quite nicely with the forty 
percent of our possessions that we have unpacked.
I have a grand plan for unpacking the rest 
which involves a large box labelled "Garage
Sale"; Blake and I will dig into that project
in the New Year.
</p>
<p>
It's a crappy little house (in some ways, and
in others it's wonderful), and sometimes I 
wonder why we bought it.  The kitchen needs 
redoing, the bathroom needs redoing (not to
mention there's only the one), the basement
isn't done at all... this house is a money sponge
capable of absorbing every spare
penny for the next two decades.  Why didn't we
buy one of the shiny, renovated perfect houses
with the dug-out, finished basements and the
second bathrooms and the nice kitchens?  
</p>
<p>
Money, for one thing; we didn't pay much for
this place.  But we're going to have to put more
than the difference back into it to get it up
to snuff.  The burning desire to be knee-deep
in plaster dust for the next five years?  A
passion to express myself through interior
design?  That can't be right.
</p>
<p>
I don't think that's the reason we bought
the house.
I think we fell in love with the
oldness of it, with the perfect trim and the
retro cabinets, and with the challenge of
taking this beloved old house and bringing it
up to date without erasing its character; 
deciding what to keep and what to take away.
Taking what is in a sense a blank slate and
making it our own.
</p>
<p>
We've got some pretty good ideas about keeping
the character while still beating the house
into twenty-first century submission.  We're
going to rip down a bunch of walls, but save
the trim and cleverly use it elsewhere:  we're
going to use the trim from between the living
room and the dining room to frame a huge
pass-through between the kitchen and the dining
room; we're going to use trim from one of the
doors to create an archway at the end of the
new front hall; we're going to use two doors
to make a headboard, and another to make a mirror
for the top of the stairs.  We're going to 
salvage the doorknobs and line them up on a
board to hang coats and hats on.  We're going
to patch the floors rather than refinish
(or replace) the hardwood.  And of course
I want to do the kitchen in a style reminiscent
of the fifties; I almost want the kitchen to 
look like it was installed in the fifties
and impeccably maintained, rather than to
look like a new kitchen with all the latest
fashions and gadgets.
</p>
<p>
I think when we're done this first phase of
renovations, the house will be modern and
comfortable, with an open living space, lots
of light and air, a large, usable kitchen,
and new wiring and light switches in sensible
places, but it will still retain the patina of
age that we love.

Today I ran for the first time in a month and a half.
I  signed up for the Resolution Run 5K on December
31 in an attempt to motivate myself to keep running
through the winter, but I didn't count on the move
joining forces with the cold weather to put me off
lacing up my sneakers.
</p>
<p>
So between cleaning and packing and moving and
unpacking and being busy and exhausted, I haven't
been running.  It seems there are things I give 
up on when I am very busy, and things I don't;
the things I give up on are exercise, reading,
baking and cooking complicated meals.  The things
I don't give up on are watching TV, sleeping,
flossing, going to choir practice and seeing 
friends.  And eating — I hear there are
people who get so busy they forget to eat, but
that's never been an issue for me.
</p>
<p>
I did, finally, go for a run today.  After the
collosal binge that is Christmas Day I was 
desperate to do something healthy, and I thought
I should test the waters to see how well I can 
expect to do at the Resolution Run on the 31st.
I did 2K today, and I didn't die; I made it through
the first ten minutes okay, although I started too
fast and almost wore myself out.  I had to take a
walk break in the second ten minutes, but only for 
half a block.  I think I should be fine in the
Run if I do five and ones or seven and ones.
</p>
<p>
Now that we are getting settled in and it's no
longer imperative to spend every spare moment
unpacking, I am going to try and go out for two 
2Ks and one 5K every week.

We made it in, and back on the internet in record time (after the
cable dude drilled a hole in our wall.  All the way through our wall.
With a really long drill bit.)
</p>
<p>
Moving day went pretty smoothly, all in all.   It took way longer than
I thought it would to move us over; we have a lot of stuff, which is
funny because I hate stuff.  I guess I don't hate it all that much.
We weren't all moved until seven at night, and then we had a minor
crisis because I wasn't smart enough to set aside pyjamas and toothbrushes
and stuff, so we had to go digging through boxes before the girls 
could go to be.  In fact they both went to bed in regular clothes
because I gave up on their pyjamas.
</p>
<p>
Today Blake and I and Morgan worked hard building furniture and
unpacking, and the place
still looks like hell but we did manage to sit on our actual sofa
and watch some actual TV this evening, and isn't that what it's all
about?  
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow the plumber comes to install our 
<a href="http://www.clawfootsupply.com/product463">shower converter thing</a>
(not that exact one but something similar) and our 
<a href="http://www.clawfootsupply.com/product906">super sexy
bridge faucet</a> (that exact one, I believe, although we didn't buy
it from that supplier).  Also the couch dudes come back to reassemble
the huge couch in Cordelia's room, and then I think that's all for
people coming to fix stuff.  For a while, anyway.
</p>
<p>
I kind of love my little house.  I knew I would.  It seems to be
holding all our stuff fairly well, even without buying new furniture
and installing clever storage solutions and, you know, adding fifteen 
feet to the back.  Although I am still trying to figure
out how previous owners have managed without any kind of coat
closet.  I love the Deco fixtures, I love how it gets warm really
quickly and stays that way (because it doesn't have a wall of
eight-foot windows in every room), I love the neighbours, I love
having rooms for the girls. 
</p>
<p>
We are still getting used to the new noises. The floors upstairs
are so creaky that our ten pound cat sets them off;  last night
poor Blake kept getting up because he thought Delphine was coming
down the hall, but no, it was just Thomas.  Tonight Blake and
I spent some time figuring out the source of a weird pinging noise;
turns out a floor joist in the dining room is attached to a duct,
and every time you step in it it flexes the duct enough to make
it ping.  And now we think we can hear the neighbour's television.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow is Monday; Blake is off work and Delphine is in daycare,
so hopefully we can get a good pile of stuff done.  Hooray!

Tomorrow we move.  We move from a spacious tenth-floor condo to a 
tiny earth-bound house.  We move from the longest street in the
world to a tiny block in a sweet, domestic, leafy neighbourhood.
From sky to ground, from noise to quiet, from city to... well, 
what used to be suburb, eighty years ago.
</p>
<p>
Everything is pretty well packed, apart from the stuff we will need
today and tomorrow morning, and Delphine's toys which we left out
to keep everything as normal as possible for her.  We signed all the 
legal papers yesterday, and we should get our new house keys today.
</p>
<p>
The new house is going to be an adventure, perhaps more of an 
adventure than you necessarily want your primary residence to be.
Between the no shower and the no dishwasher and the ancient stove...
well, as my real estate agent keeps telling me encouragingly,
"it will be like being at the cottage!"  Without the beach
and the ice cream stand.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, yesterday I learned that "So are you all packed yet?!"
is the "Still pregnant?!" of moving, and equally annoying and 
unhelpful.  "No!  Piss off!"
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
We're going to be offline for a couple of days; cable will shut down
tomorrow and the cable guy isn't coming to set it up at the new place
until Sunday morning.  And I am frankly a little skeptical that he
will be able to get it working; I don't think the cable company 
appreciates the depth and breadth of the non-cable-having-ness of
the new house.  (No cable.  Ever.)  We'll see.  
Anyway, the website will be down and
we won't be getting email, so if you want to contact us you'll have
to phone, except the phone will be shut off on Saturday morning.
So you'll have to visit.  We'll be somewhere on Davisville.
</p>
<p>
See you in the new house!
