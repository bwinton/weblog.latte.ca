    <p>
There will come a day, probably when your baby is around five
or six months, that she will no longer be amused by brightly
coloured or pastel coloured, hard or squishy baby toys.  No
matter how novel they are, your baby will somehow be able to
detect that they are intended for her, and as such she will
turn her little baby nose up at them, especially when you
particularly want her to be quietly absorbed in something,
like when you're at a restaurant or on a plane.
</p>
<p>
It is at those times that you will have to resort to baby
toys that aren't.  Fortunately there are plenty of them,
and anyone who has had a baby for a while has a few tricks
up their sleeve.
</p>
<h4>In Your Bag</h4>
<p>
Keys, of course, are classic.  They jingle, there are
lots of different and interesting textures, they are
cold and hard on itchy teething gums, and it doesn't 
matter if you slobber all over them.  Provided you
clean them off before you give them to the baby.
</p>
<p>
Credit cards (or perhaps more sensibly, loyalty cards
or something else you can easily replace) are nice too.
They're a good size and weight to hold on to, and they have those
interesting embossed letters on them.
</p>
<p>
Water bottles -- for some reason babies love water 
bottles.  Both Cordelia and Delphine played with them
for hours!  Well, minutes, which are like hours in 
baby years.
</p>
<h4>In Your Kitchen</h4>
<p>
The kitchen is packed with interesting things to chew
on.  Wooden spoons are great -- you hardly ever see
baby toys made of wood, so it's probably a new and
exciting texture for your baby.  Teaspoons are nice,
too -- smooth and hard and shiny.  Delphine really 
liked a silicone spatula, and Cordelia amused herself for
half-an-hour the other day with a bright red silicone
basting brush.  It must have felt so interesting in
her mouth, all those little soft silicone bristles.
</p>
<p>
Measuring cups and small bowls are fun too, especially
when you drop them on the floor and they make a
spectacular rang-tang-tanging noise.  (Unless you
have a baby who startles easily, in which case she
will probably scare herself and cry and cry.)
</p>
<p>
I had a surprise hit the other day with one of those
mesh bags you wash your bras in -- Cordelia sucked it,
she chewed it, she stuffed it in her mouth and pulled
it out again (it was like a magic trick), she found
the label and chewed on that.  No end of amusement!
</p>
<h4>In Your Living Room</h4>
<p>
Okay, there's not much in here -- you don't want
your kid playing with your CDs or chewing your books.
But there is one thing that every baby covets: the
remote control.  And don't try and buy one of those
brightly coloured fake-o toy remotes, either, your
kid is too smart for that.  She wants the real thing!
The only hope is to find an old remote that doesn't
work any more, take out the batteries and make sure
none of the bits are going to come off, and let her
have it.
</p>
<h4>In Your Bedroom</h4>
<p>
Hairbrushes and combs keep Cordelia amused while I
change her diaper, and sometimes when I'm desperate
I give her a lotion bottle for a few moments (after
checking that the lid is secure.)
</p>
<p>
Fabric is fun for babies; I have had success with
a lovely pair of brightly printed silk boxer shorts
(sorry Blake).  Silk is especially good for a baby
who is just beginning to grip, because it is incredibly
light and easy to get a grip on.  Cordelia 
seems to enjoy the texture of a wet or dry facecloth.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
The bottom line is, don't feel that you have to limit
your baby to baby toys.  You can give her any old thing
provided it's reasonably clean, and that it's not going to
break up into chokeable or sharp pieces. Use your
common sense, and you and your baby will be quietly
amused for, well, minutes.

Put some frozen blueberries in a bowl.  (I like
<a href="http://www.europesbest.com/">Europe's Best</a>

cream to almost cover the berries.  Wait a few seconds

This is the world's best chocolate cake recipe -- it's
really easy, it always
comes out moist and rich and delicious, and best of all it
calls for cocoa powder, which I always have in the house,
not unsweetened chocolate, which I never have.  Use the
leftover buttermilk to make pancakes.
</p>
<h4>Cocoa Fudge Cake<br>
from the Betty Crocker Cookbook, 1969 Edition</h4>
<p>
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour<br>
1Â½ cups sugar<br>
2/3 cup cocoa<br>
1Â½ teaspoons baking soda<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
1Â½ cups buttermilk<br>
Â½ cup shortening<br>
2 eggs (1/3 to Â½ cup)<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla
</p>
<p>
Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour baking pan,
13x9x2 inches, or 2 round layer pans, 8 or 9x1Â½
inches. 
</p>
<p>
Measure all ingredients into large mixer bowl.  Blend
Â½ minute on low speed, scraping bowl constantly.
Beat 3 minutes high speed, scraping bowl occasionally.
Pour into pan(s).
</p>
<p>
Bake oblong 35 to 40 minutes, layers 30 to 35 minutes
or until wooden pick inserted in centre comes out clean.
Cool.
</p>
<p>
If desired (!), frost cake.

<h4>Cocoa Butter Frosting<br>
from the Betty Crocker Cookbook, 1969 Edition</h4>
<p>
Here's a frosting recipe I've used, with similarly
excellent results.
</p>
<p>
1/3 cup soft butter<br>
1/3 cup cocoa<br>
2 cups confectioner's sugar<br>
1Â½ teaspoons vanilla<br>
About 2 tablespoons milk
</p>
<p>
Mix thoroughly butter and cocoa.  Blend in sugar.
Stir in vanilla and milk; beat until frosting is
smooth and of spreading consistency.

<p>
Fills and frosts two 8- or 9-inch layers or frosts
a 13x9 inch cake.

One of the things -- one of the many things -- I love about
this condo is that it's right on a major street, so when
I open the windows the sounds of the city come into my 
living room.  Traffic, sirens, the "beep, beep, beep" of
a truck backing up, people shouting to their friends...
crazy people yelling, the odd car crash.  To most people,
I guess, this doesn't sound so hot, but I like the
feeling of being in the middle of something without
having to actually leave the house.

We're one week into the reno, and the dust is flying.  The
electrical is almost done; we are replacing all the old
knob-and-tube wiring with the modern stuff, putting in
mostly new  light fixtures and light switches  in sensible
places, instead of three feet into the bedroom, or behind
the far door to the dining room, or just nowhere at all
in Delphine's room. (She had one of those bank-pen-chain
pull switches that she didn't have a hope of reaching for
another ten years.)
</p>
<p>
On the main floor, where most of the big changes are 
happening, the demolition is nearly complete.  They have taken
down all the walls except that between the kitchen and
the dining room, and that which defines the front hall
(and keeps the drafts out).  They've taken out the old
cabinet in the kitchen, the sink and its cabinet, and
the old gnarly linoleum tiles and subfloor.  They've cut and framed
a hole between the kitchen and the dining room, which
is going to be finished with some trim salvaged from 
the original arch between the dining room and the living
room.  The only demolition which remains to be done is
taking up the hardwood in the front hall (we are going
to put in vintage-style black and white mosaic tile 
instead).
</p>
<p>
Next week the inspector is coming in for the electrical,
and then they will patch the walls and start painting
upstairs.  They are going to move the plumbing for the 
sink, and put in the vent for the range hood, and lay
the new subfloor in the kitchen.  It's been fun watching
them tear the place apart, but I am really going to enjoy
watching them put it back together.
</p>
<p>
We haven't been able, to the shock of no-one, to salvage
and reuse as much as I originally thought we would.  I
said we would keep the cabinet in the kitchen but quickly
changed my mind when I realized how much I like runners on
my drawers, and base cabinets that don't go all the way
to the floor, and not having huge frames in the way of my
stuff, and maybe upper cabinets that are deep enough to 
store a dinner plate.  I got rid of the metal trim on
the counter because Jillian's right, it's a total pain
to keep clean.  I got rid of the stove because there's 
just no way to make an ancient electric stove into a
modern gas stove.  I got rid of the cabinet for the
sink because again, I wanted to get rid of the frames
and have more versatile cabinetry (we are putting a bunch
of drawers under the sink cabinet).
</p>
<p>
I haven't even kept many light fixtures; I kept the 
pretty fixtures in the girls' rooms, but almost all of
the others are gone, with the exception of a gorgeous
Nouveau fixture from the front hall which is too dim
to be useful but which we will reuse somewhere where
we don't need all that much light.
</p>
<p>
Ironically, we are ripping out a genuine vintage kitchen
and replacing it with a vintage-inspired kitchen.  Our
cabinets are going to be 
<a href="http://ths.gardenweb.com/forums/load/kitchbath/gal1212265932402.html?14">Applad White</a> which is flat-panel painted white,
very much like the original cabinet.  The floor is
going to be 
<a href="http://www.forbo.com/framework/ModuleFiles/mod_Product/Product/Image/994/3038.jpg">Marmoleum</a> in Caribbean, and the 
countertops will be 
<a href="http://www.formica.com/publish/site/na/us/en/index/laminate/colors_collections/classics.detail.6940.0001.html">Formica's Skylark
Boomerang</a>.  Oh, and the paint is Benjamin Moore's Standish
White, which almost exactly matches the floor.  
I am going to look for a vintage-style
wallpaper to do a focal point, and maybe a cute fabric for
a little curtain.  Three more weeks to go!

Well, it's four in the morning and I've been wide awake for at least
three-quarters of an hour.  I finally decided to stop lying in
bed thinking the same five thoughts over and over, and creep
down the world's creakiest stairs and make myself useful.
I don't think I will be sleeping again tonight, and I know
I'll regret it later this afternoon, but what can you do?
This must be what it's like to be Baba, or my brother Dave.

We are less than a week from the start of "demolition", a
rather grand name for clearing out the kitchen and taking 
down a couple of walls.  I suppose removing the little porch
from the back is pretty demolishy.  It all begins on Monday,
and in the intervening four days we need to clear as much
stuff as we can out of the main floor, and set up a makeshift
kitchen in the basement.  In the next month we are going to
become very familiar with what meals can and cannot be prepared
with a microwave, a toaster oven, a kettle and a crock pot.
I predict we will eat a lot of President's Choice frozen
meals.  And did you know they have microwave pizza?  Yeah...
</p>
<p>
The girls and I will also become very familiar with places
to hang out that are not home; Baba and Zaida's, the library,
the ROM, the park (if spring ever comes), Tanya's place, the
other library...  It's going to be a bit of a pain in the
ass, but I think the satisfaction of seeing the work progress
day after day will make up for it, unlike the changeless agony
of, say, trying to keep a condo clean and tidy while you're
selling it.

We signed a contract for the reno last week, and now the work
is beginning.  The work, for now, is mostly just talking about
what goes where and where to get stuff and what colours, and 
Blake and I have to buy lots of stuff; new light fixtures,
appliances, a kitchen faucet, tiles for the backsplash and the
front hall floor.  It would be swell if we had a car right now.
</p>
<p>
We got a couple of quotes, one which was horrifyingly high and
one which was alarmingly low.  Fortunately the people who quoted
low come highly recommended and they basically lowballed us, I
think, because they like Blake's dad and because they know that
we have years and years of work to do on this house and they
want in on the ground floor, so to speak.
</p>
<p>
So this reno looks like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Kitchen:
 <ul>
<li>new Marmoleum floor</li>
  <li>new cabinets, probably from Ikea</li>
  <li>big pass-through window to the dining room</li>
  <li>new (gas!) stove</li>
  <li>dishwasher (hallelujah!)</li>
  <li>new fridge</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://www.formica.com/publish/products/en/laminate/classics/skylark_boomerang.Specifications.0001.LargeImage.Image.gif">funky</a> Formica countertops</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>new electrical throughout, because we still have knob
  and tube almost everywhere</li>
<li>new light fixtures some places</li>
<li>knock out most of the walls on the main floor to make
  it more open, although I would stop short of calling it
  "open concept" because we'll still have a well-defined
  front hall and the kitchen will still be cut off by a
  wall, albeit a wall with a big pass-through window</li>
<li>replace the hardwood in the front hall with black and
  white mosaic tile in some cool retro pattern (we'll use 
  the hardwood from the front hall to patch the holes from
  taking out the walls.)</li>
<li>New deck!</li>
</ul>
<p>
All in all it's a fairly small reno; we are not adding any
rooms or messing with any outside walls.  It is scheduled
to take about a month, with the actual work beginning
mid-March.
</p>
<p>
I am really excited; once the reno is done we will still
have a crappy old house, but it will be a crappy old house
with a really nice, functional kitchen and light switches
in logical places, and I can deal with that!
