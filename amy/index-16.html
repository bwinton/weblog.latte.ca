Okay, I promise that I’m not going to keep on posting more and more
pictures every day, if only because I don’t think I could take 14 good
pictures on the 14th day…  But today there were really three things I
wanted to point out.  The first is the view from the back door out
into the garden.  That’s pretty much how it’ll look every time I walk
out there.  Well, with a top on it, and planters and a garbage box and
a barbeque, and stuff, but that’s the layout.<br clear="left"><a href="../images/deck2007/0717b.jpg"><img align="left" src="../images/deck2007/small/0717b.jpg" alt="It’s big, from this angle." style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"></a>

The next shot is how it will look coming in to the house (if you’re
really small, like Cordelia).  Amy noticed that our house looks a
little ramshackle, with the door all boarded up and stuff.  (Cory (see
<a href="houseandhome/reno/deck/july16.html">the previous
entry</a>) was nice enough to screw a few boards in so that the girls
didn’t fall out.)<br clear="left"><a href="../images/deck2007/0717c.jpg"><img align="left" src="../images/deck2007/small/0717c.jpg" alt="The Master Plan." style="margin-right:10px"></a>

And finally, the shot from Delphine’s room, where you can see the
full-width stairs down the back (on the top of the picture); the
cut-out for the stairs on the side; and, uh, well I guess that’s all
you can see, but on top of the cut-out will be one of the planters,
wiht a matching planter on the other side; underneath the cut-out will
be the garbage-box-thing; on the lower left will be the barbeque, and
the upper half will have a table and chairs for lounging.<br><br>
There’s also a nice amount of space on the right for my bicycle, so I
guess I should figure out a way to make that area a little smoother
and nicer to bike or walk on.<br clear="all"></p>

I am sure I have read a book in the last six months.  Maybe
even two or three.  Now that the reno is over I have run out
of excuses for not reading, so here goes.
</p>
<p>
According to my notebooks I read <b><em>Born To Buy: The 
Commercialized Child and the New Consumer Culture</em> by
Juliet Schor</b> and there wasn't much in there that I
didn't know; companies spend billions marketing all kinds
of products to children.  I was creeped out by the use
of viral and peer-to-peer marketing — using kids to sell
stuff to their friends.  The other annoying thing is the
way marketing and consumer culture loves to position
parents as dorky ineffectual losers who should be ignored
as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
Also worth noting is the connection between immersion in
consumer culture and depression in children.  One of the
great things my parents did for me (although not entirely
intentionally) was shelter me from consumer culture to a
large entent, partially by not having TV (or not having
cable) and partially just because we couldn't afford lots
of toys so we mostly found our fun in books from the 
library and plenty of public radio.  Good geeky fun.
</p>
<p>
<b><em>Kids Are Worth It: Raising Children to be Responsible, 
Resourceful, Caring Individuals</em> by Barbara Coloroso</b>
is a book I read because it's often quoted in the parenting
magazines, and it seemed like one of those books I ought to
read.  And I'm really glad I did; it crystallized a lot of
the vague parenting philosophies I'd had and gave me lots of
ideas and structure for how to implement them: how to treat
my kids with respect, how to provide consequences, how to
discipline.  Coloroso is a great resource for a frazzled
mum because she gives you lots of bulleted lists and 
mnemonics so you can recall her advice in moments of stress.
Which are most of them, really.
</p>
<p>
Alright, I've read more than two books in the last six
months but now the stupid (I mean lovely) baby is awake
so you'll have to wait another six months for my next 
post.  Adios!

I was out inspecting my garden this afternoon and I found that
two of my zucchini mounds are growing little seedlings!  I
realize growing zucchini is not normally considered an accomplishment,
but it's the first of the things I have put into this garden that
has actually grown, so I am fairly pleased with myself.  Especially
considering I caught a squirrel on one of the mounds munching on
a snack of zucchini seeds a couple of days after I planted them.
</p>
<p>
There's also a couple of things coming up where I planted the
sunflower seeds.  I'm not sure if they're sunflowers, but they
were cute and hearty so I left them.
</p>
<p>
In other news, the latest thing the maple tree is flinging at
us is little green caterpillars.  Oh, and we have 
<a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/8284">golden dung
flies</a>, which are really pretty cool as bugs go, apart
from the obvious dung implication.  Stupid neighbour's dogs.

I was in the garden this morning hanging out some washing.  It's
a nice sunny day and the kids were enjoying themselves in the
garden, so I decided I would water the plants (as per
J'Anne's advice, and the strawberry was looking a little limp).  I
know midday is not the ideal time to water plants, but when you
have little kids you go to war with the schedule you have, not the
schedule you want.
</p>
<p>
First, though, I cleaned up a dog poo in my garlic patch.  (Must
see about getting fences on the back and front.)  After I watered,
I was pulling up weeds around the garlic and cherry tomatoes
when I saw two more dog poops, and then immediately was stung
by a huge stinging nettle plant growing merrily by the maple
tree.
</p>
<p>
So I gave up, rounded up the children and we're going to stay
in the safe, cool, low-UV poop-free (mainly) indoors for the rest of
the day.  And I will figure out how to tackle the nettles. 
Unless we go to Starbucks.

When we bought this little house it came with a garden.
A big garden.  A big, intimidating garden which 
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/2006/0927/04-w-garden.jpg">used to
be</a> really well-tended and loved.  I, on the other hand, have
never gardened before and have no idea what I'm doing.  This poor
garden doesn't know what hit it.
</p>
<p>
So far I have spent a lot of time cleaning up; we have a maple
tree in the backyard (oh, and another one in the front yard) and
apparently the primary occupation of maple trees is to drop crap
on you all year 'round: blossoms, maple keys, leaves.  I can
only assume that the maple syrup is by way of apology.  
</p>
<p>
Blake's aunt J'Anne, the family gardener, was up a couple of weeks
ago and we did a lot of work moving plants from the backyard to the
front -- there are lots of plants near the back door where the 
deck will eventually be, and we are going to try and rescue as
many of them as we can.  We also weeded the front border, especially
under the hedge.  The hedge is doomed; I am going to get rid of it
sometime in the next couple of years and plant something pretty
in its place.  But in the meantime it harbours a lot of crappy
little weeds, and maple saplings.  Stupid maple trees.
</p>
<p>
Since J'Anne was here I also added a bunch of hot pink impatiens to the
front, mainly because Baba told me to.  I think they will look
nice once they fill out.  They're cute now, but small.
</p>
<p>
In the back yard, I haven't done much; I am paralysed by the
sheer size.  I did plant a bunch of vegetables: zucchini, corn,
sunflowers, and lettuce seeds, and squash, tomato, strawberry, 
basil, sage, lavender and mint plants.  There are already what
I thought were onions but I now suspect are garlic, as well as
a huge patch of raspberries.  So far I don't think anything that
I have planted has, oh, say, grown at all, but Manuel's stuff
(the previous owner) is doing fantastically.  The previous owners had some
serious green thumbs, considering that most of the garden gets
at best partial sun.  But then they were retired and by all accounts
spent all their time gardening.
</p>
<p>
Other stuff that is growing from last year includes a glorious
patch of ostrich ferns, some cosmos, violets, daylilies, a rose,
bleeding heart, more ostrich ferns, sedum, daffodils, and some
stuff which might be weeds.  And lots of stuff which definitely
is weeds; I have been preparing the ground on an as-needed basis,
which means there are still lots of messy scrubby patches.
</p>
<p>
I am overwhelmed by the learning curve ahead of me; there seems
to be so much you need to know to be a successful gardener.  The
nice thing, though, is that it's almost consequence-free.  The
worst that can happen is that I could buy a plant or some seeds
and have them fail.  No-one will be disappointed, no-one will get
hurt, and I'll get to spend some time outside getting dirty.

So.  My back is screwed up, again, probably because I haven't
been doing the stretches and things I am supposed to do, and
generally haven't been doing any exercise at all, apart from
the usual lugging of kids and light housekeeping and gardening.
Apparently that isn't going to do the trick, though, so I am
looking into starting Pilates with Morgan as soon as my back
clears up.
</p>
<p>
For today, though, I am useless.  Delphine has literally been
watching TV all day.  It's a bit of an experiment; will she
ever get sick of watching TV?  So far, no.  Cordelia has been 
amusing herself in that babyish way just wandering around
exploring toys and things.  Babies are so easy.
</p>
<p>
I've been icing my back (mmm, icing) and taking ibuprofen all
day, and it feels a bit better.  Hopefully by tomorrow I will
be fine, because tomorrow morning Delphine has her four-year-old
annual checkup and I don't fancy limping down there with her
and Cordelia in tow.  Still and all, I'll manage one way or
another.  And now Miss Cordelia is awake, so I have to go retrieve
her.

I have so much to blog about and not coincidentally no time
to blog, but I am going to try and squeeze in a couple of
things before Cordelia wakes up and we have to go pick
up Delphine and take her to her hair appointment.  Which
really should be happening RIGHT NOW.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the reno is done and yes I will post pictures.  Well,
almost done; we are missing a light fixture — we are
reusing an original fixture and it is at the shop being 
refitted with modern, I don't know, bits and pieces —
and we need faceplates on the outlets in the kitchen now
that the tile is done.  And a deck, we need a deck, although
we might not be able to afford one.  Otherwise it's done,
though!
</p>
<p>
I'm really happy with how the kitchen looks; I think we really
captured the feel of the fifties while still having a nice
modern kitchen.  I am especially pleased with how content
the sink looks nestled on the retro Formica countertop.
</p>
<p>
Now all we need to do is unpack the kitchen!  In order to
make Delphine's birthday cake today I had to buy baking
powder, flour, food colouring, sprinkles, and cake pans!
All because I haven't managed to unpack anything yet.
