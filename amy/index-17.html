July 27 is <a href="http://www.sysadminday.com/">System Administrator
Appreciation Day</a>, so in honour of my brother (who is no longer
administering sys, but did for a long time to the detriment of
his own mental health and love of humanity), my friends Jeff, Woody
(both also ex-sysamins) and Jason (who I believe does anything for
money, provided there are Macs involved), and of course my own home 
sysadmin Blake, go and buy your sysadmin a fancy coffee (or a beer).

A Gate!  No longer just a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agate">pretty stone</a>, we now
have a gate to keep out whatever’s been pooing in our yard.  (Assuming
it isn’t one of the girls.  Or a raccoon.  Or someone’s cat.  Or
something that could squeeze through the gap in the bottom.  But
still, it’s got to be less likely to continue, right?)<br clear="left"><a href="../images/deck2007/0726b.jpg"><img align="left" src="../images/deck2007/small/0726b.jpg" alt="The Shed." style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"></a>

Our garbage shed!  It’s a bit larger than I thought it would be which
I think is partially due to the sloped roof, which is mandatory in
places that get as much snow as we sometimes do, and partially
because…  Well, I don’t know why else it might be so big.  Maybe just
because that was the scale of the space it had to take up.  <br clear="left"><a href="../images/deck2007/0726c.jpg"><img align="left" src="../images/deck2007/small/0726c.jpg" alt="Screen!" style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"></a>

And an old-new screen door.  This should get some air moving through
the house without my having to worry too much about finding a hornet
in my bed (again!)  And when the screen on the front gets installed,
it should be even sweeter.<br clear="all"></p>

And the inside of the garbage bin, with obligatory cat.<br clear="all">

Okay, so the comments were a little weak today, I’m recovering from a
severe arm wound, cut me some slack.

<strong><em>Extraordinary Evil: A Brief History of Genocide</em> by 
Barbara Coloroso</strong>.  Like so many of us, Coloroso has been
doing a sort of independent study of genocide and she came up
with the rather surprising, at first glance, theory that genocide
is bullying writ large.  I was pretty skeptical at first but
she sold me on her idea; she has done a lot of thinking about
bullying and she has her trademark bulleted lists on the topic
all figured out, and she manages to map them to genocide 
quite convincingly.  I'll probably check out her book on bullying,
and also a few of the books she refers to on genocide.  A few
of them were on my list before but I chickened out; maybe this
time I will have the guts to actually read them.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Outbreak: Plagues that Changed History</em> by
Bryn Barnard</strong> is actually a picture book which
I grabbed from the kids' section because I'm all about plagues
and gruesome diseases.  However, it's written at what seems
to me to be a very advanced level.  It is a fantastic book;
each chapter discusses one plague and its effect on society,
and the illustrations (also by the author) are lush.
</p>
<p>
I didn't actually read <em>The Assault on Reason</em> by Al 
Gore because I had it out of the library and I had to take
it back before I got more than a couple of chapters in.  However,
I was pleasantly surprised; in the chapters I read he got into
why people are so compelled by television, so it seems like he's
really getting into the very roots of why American politics is
so screwed up.  I have put myself on the hold list again (I am number 
249 of 267) and I look forward to having another crack at this
book.  Sometime in 2008.

Okay, Cordelia is napping and Delphine is busy with <em>Charlie
and Lola</em> and I am for once not too tired to move, so allow
me to type a list of all the books I have read but not yet 
posted about, and perhaps even discuss one or two.
</p>
<h4>Books About Technical Stuff</h4>
<p>
<strong><em>Making the Most of Kitchens</em> by Gilly Love</strong>.
I read this before the reno when we were still trying to figure
out what we were going to do.  It wasn't really all that useful
because I had pretty much made all the big decisions, and we
didn't have that much flexibility in terms of layout anyway. 
However, if
I hadn't thought about what kind of countertop I wanted or
whether wood floors were a good idea, this book might have 
come in useful.  It had lots of pictures of different kitchens
for decorating inspiration.
</p>
<p>
The fact that it was an English book was a little weird
at times; she tries to talk you into refrigerating things.
Now there's an idea!
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Non-Designer's Design Book</em> by Robin 
Williams</strong> is a very useful overview for non-designers
who none-the-less find themselves having to design or judge
the design of letters, newsletters, logos, business cards,
posters, banners, and so on.  If, like me, you know what
you like but you don't know why, or (worse) you know what
you <em>don't</em> like but don't know how to fix it, this book
is a must-read.  
</p>
<p>
Williams breaks design down into four simple
principles (contrast, repetition, proximity, and alignment)
and then explains how to apply them to make your documents
more attractive and powerful while never overlooking the
most important thing, communication.
</p>
<p>
If I'm ever in a position where I have to create documents
I will definitely have a copy of this book on my shelf.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Vegetable Gardening From Planting to Picking: 
The Complete Guide to Creating a Bountiful Garden</em> by 
Fern Marshall Bradley and Jane Courtier</strong> and some 
other, slightly thinner but equally useful vegetable
gardning book which
I read rather belatedly this June and July.  My garden is
doing, frankly, rather dismally.  I just brought a foot long
zucchini home from my friend Tanya's garden, while my
zucchini plant has one little three-inch fruit on it.  
Honestly, who can't grow a zucchini?  But according to these
books I should have spent a lot more time and effort 
preparing the earth before planting, and I definitely need
to water, fertilize and weed more.  Maybe at all.  Yes,
there isn't really anything I did right this year, but
the lovely thing about gardening is you can always try
again next year.
</p>
<p>
The books cover everything from planning your garden
(another thing I didn't really do) to harvesting and
preserving your crops, as well as giving specific 
growing and harvesting instructions for a variety of
fruit and vegetables.  The only problem I had was that
the books were written for all of North America, so I
had to selectively ignore advice about things like okra
and peanuts which will never grow in good old Zone 5.
I wonder if there's a good Ontario vegetable gardening 
book.  (I bet the library would know!)
</p>
<h4>Books for Fun</h4>
<p>
<strong><em>The Rabbi's Girls</em> by Johanna Hurwitz</strong>.
I picked this up off the young adult rack at the library
because I am interested in juvenile literature with
Jewish content, if only to know what to steer the girls
towards when they get older and want some context about
their own personal history.  This is a novel about a
family that moves around the US midwest (? I think, 
I can't exactly remember) as their rabbi father
is shunted from community to community (parish?  I'm
sure that's not the word!)  It was a nice light read,
I can't complain.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Does Anything Eat Wasps? And 101 Other Questions</em>
by New Scientist</strong>.  This is a collection of questions
and answers from New Scientist's Last Word page (okay, I'm making
that up, I can't remember the name of their last page) where people
send in their perplexing sciency questions and other people take
a stab at answering them.  This was the first book I read after
we came up for air after the reno, and it was a nice easy
way to get back into using my brain again.  There's plenty 
of interesting stuff in here, but of course my favourite thing
was the question about why some people sound better than others
when they sing.
</p>
<p>
Okay, I only have three books to go, but Delphine would like
me to play with her so off I go!  Maybe Blake will hurt
himself again and post about it.

The facing went on!  Apparently we got fewer long planks than we
needed, so Cory couldn’t finish the deck itself, so instead he put on
the facing, and started building the frames for the planters.  Hey,
I just noticed the big long stair at the front.  Neat!<br clear="left"><a href="../images/deck2007/0723b.jpg"><img align="left" src="../images/deck2007/small/0723b.jpg" alt="Stonehenge.  Kinda." style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"></a>

Finally, a set of stairs!  I can’t tell you how excited I am about
those, although I am a little curious as to why that first step is
twice as long as the second…  Maybe the ground moved up.  Yeah, that's
what I'll go with.<br clear="left"><a href="../images/deck2007/0720b.jpg"><img align="left" src="../images/deck2007/small/0720b.jpg" alt="Stonehenge.  Kinda." style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"></a>

This line of stones brought to you by Cordelia.  It’s nice to see that
she can create order as well as chaos.<br clear="left"><a href="../images/deck2007/0720c.jpg"><img align="left" src="../images/deck2007/small/0720c.jpg" alt="A window to nowhere." style="margin-right:10px"></a>

And finally, a bonus picture for Andrew.  Yes, that was a window you
saw under our deck.  I’m not sure how we’ll get light into the
basement now.  Perhaps with electricity.  (I’m also not sure what is
going to happen to the edge of the deck, so we just might still get
some light from the edges.<br clear="all"></p>

and so nothing’s going to happen to the deck today.  Perhaps
tomorrow.<br>(Oh, and the weather department doesn't keep historical
pages active, so by the time you click on the little cloud, it might
say something completely different.)<br clear="all"></p>

least, far quicker than I would have been able to do it.  The last
quarter of the last board in the big group on the right isn't screwed
down yet, but I’m sure it’s only a matter of time.</p>

<p>Still to do, the stairs, the planters, and the garbage bin.  We
might not be getting a barbeque until the end of the summer, because a
friend of the family is downsizing, and might give us her’s, but
either way, I plan on having a party when the deck is done, with beer
and margaritas and some sort of munchie thing.  And of course you’re
all invited!  I’ll start planning it after the deck is actually done,
and post details when they’re finalized.<br clear="all"></p>
