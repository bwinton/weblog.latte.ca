    <p>
Today marks exactly one year since we moved into our little
house.  A year ago this evening we were sitting amid piles and
piles of boxes, still fretting from our run-in with surly
movers and our inability to locate toothbrushes or pyjamas
for the children.  Last Christmas was a cluttered mess with no
decorations except for a tiny pre-decorated tree.  
The months ahead would be full of frozen 
convenience food because our stove was unusable (although very
funky!), dim lighting, long walks to daycare, and the crustiest 
old linoleum I had
ever seen.  When I look back at it now I wonder how we 
possibly got through it, but at the time it seemed all right.
Kind of.
</p>
<p>
So after slogging through a long and unChristmassy December
in the new house, we interviewed a few contractors.  Mostly
they didn't seem to want to have anything to do with us, probably
because I got a list of recommendations from a friend of
contractors from the suburbs, and I bet they don't care to
bother with little houses with no driveway and tiny doors
and muddy access lanes when they can find a million suburban
clients with huge houses and lots of land to park their
dumpsters on.  But we finally found a guy who was really
nice and seemed helpful and smart, and seemed to understand
what we wanted, and who cost a billion
dollars.  We were very sad.  We looked at our reno plan
and started making cuts, and got into big fights; Blake
wanted to take down the walls and make do with the kitchen,
I thought I couldn't possibly make do with the kitchen and
the walls were aesthetic and could wait.  We cried.  Well,
I cried.  It sucked.
</p>
<p>
Then finally Andy made us meet with Stephanie and her
company, and they agreed to do the whole job for about half
the price the other dude was asking.  Half the price.  We had to make sure
they hadn't made a mistake about what we wanted, their price
was so low.  Well, the fact was they were doing a 
huge favour for Andy because he's such a swell guy; they
made us promise never to tell anyone else what they
charged us because they would go out of business if they
did any other jobs at that rate.  (It's good to have a
really charming father-in-law!)  So we didn't have to compromise.
We got it all: we took down the walls on the main floor,
we got a whole new kitchen, we tiled the front hall, 
we redid the electrical in the whole house and painted.
It all took only a couple of months, and to Stephanie
and her team's credit, they did everything to the 
exact same high standard that they set for their richer
clients, because they take personal pride in doing their
jobs properly.  
</p>
<p>
In fact, just last week I discovered that
the trained monkeys who installed our Ikea  kitchen had
neglected to install the forced air vent.  They didn't just
forget, they actually saw that it should be done, didn't do
it, and willfully assembled the cabinetry so that the venting was 
very hard to install, because that was the easy thing for
them to do.  Cory had left a piece of venting there to 
show them where they would need to work around, and they 
took it out and tossed it aside, and then installed a
cabinet with the legs directly in front of the vent hole in 
the wall.  So last week when I realized there was no heat
in the kitchen, I emailed Stephanie.  She sent Cory in,
Cory arrived with his tools, assessed the situation, 
figured out a solution, implemented the solution, tidied
up and was out of there in a couple of hours.  No bill,
no invoice, nothing; it was considered part of the 
original reno, which is already paid for.  
</p>
<p>
Stephanie has also sent members of her team back to repair
and paint cracks in the walls where the new drywall 
settled, to fix a sticky latch on a gate, and to clean
up some foam caulking stuff which someone had spilled
on the floor.  Stephanie believes in leaving a perfect
site, no matter how long it takes.
</p>
<p>
The reno wasn't a lot of fun to live through.  We set up
a makeshift kitchen (microwave, toaster oven and fridge)
next to the laundry sink in the basement and spent our days
there, in the tiny corner of the living room which was
cordoned off with a plastic sheet, and at Baba and Zaida's
house.  Oh, that sucked and it was a very long eight weeks
but it passed as inexorably as any other eight weeks, and 
one day it was over; appliances installed, plaster dust
vacuumed up, paint dried.  Suddenly we were normal people
with a normal (mostly) house.  What bliss!  What joy!
</p>
<p>
Now we have a house with lots of space on the main
floor (well... relatively speaking), a bright, sunny,
organized kitchen which gets a lot of use, tons of 
electrical outlets and lights, and a huge back deck.  I'm
really starting to like this house.  I did suffer a pang
of jealousy sitting in my friend's south-facing living
room.  We don't have any south-facing windows, and the
west windows are in the kitchen and Delphine's room, and
they're really pretty small.  So we don't get that ocean
of warm sunshine we used to get in the condo, and I miss
that on sunny winter days.  I hope that a couple of skylights
will make the house brighter.  One day.
</p>
<p>
A year ago today, cold, frustrated, tired, missing the condo
and wondering what the hell we had done, I consoled myself 
with the thought that in 
a year everything would be normal and happy again, and I was
right.  Yesterday we spent the whole day putting up our
(really rather huge, in this place) Christmas tree, spangling
the mantelpiece with tinsel and lights and tiny china Santas
(and a menorah, poor thing), and stringing J'Anne's beautiful
handmade stockings all up the staircase.  The house is warm
and cozy and full of love and giggling little girls, and I
could hardly be any happier.

Our neighbourhood loves Hallowe'en.  At least half of the 
houses, it seems, are decorated, and the sidewalks were so
thick with trick or treaters last night that most people
weren't even bothering to close their doors between
visitors.  On our block most of our neighbours were sitting
on the front porch steps chatting; some with wine, some
without.
</p>
<p>
We decorated our house with three pumpkins (remember when
one jack o' lantern was enough?) and three bats made from
our leftover NDP campaign sign, painstakingly cut out and
coloured with black magic marker.  We also used the 
uprights upon which said sign was mounted to string a 
spiderweb to which I glued a spider, also made from
the sign.  (I decided I wasn't going to buy anything
last month so we had to make our own decorations from
whatever we had at hand.  Thank goodness there had been
an election!)  It all looked pretty awesome,
and all the more satisfying since we didn't just buy it
at the dollar store.  I guess today I should
take it all down.
</p>
<p>
Last night Cordelia was dressed as a bumblebee, with 
yellow and black
tights and a pair of sparkly wings.  (The headband with 
antennae came off pretty early and Morgan and I ended
up wearing it.)  She loved trick or treating, and she
wouldn't let anyone else hold her bag of candy even when
it was almost too heavy for her to carry.  She learned
to say "t'ick a t'eat!" and "t'anks!" right away.  Well,
with prompting.
</p>
<p>
Delphine was a bunny, with fluffy ears, a beige hoodie (bunnyhug!) 
and a cottontail sewed to her white skirt.  She was into
trick or treating until she hit the Brick Wall of Sleepiness
at around 7:15 and refused to get off the 
<a href="http://www.lascal.se/html/kb_models01.aspx">kiddy 
board</a> until we got home.  Cordelia trick or treated
at a couple of different houses after that and when Delphine
was asked if she wanted some candy she said "No thanks."
When that kid is tired, she is tired.
</p>
<p>
After we got home and sorted through Delphine's candy,
and ate some, we put the girls to bed (an hour late!)
Then Blake and I picked through their respective booty
and set aside the thirty most succulent (and safe, and
appropriate) pieces (one for
each day in November) for each girl, and kept the rest for ourselves!
Well, Blake will take them to work and fatten up his
colleagues.  Then we sat and watched <em>Band Candy</em> and
ate chocolate until we were done eating chocolate.  Which,
for reference, means we ate a lot of chocolate.  Mmmm...

Cordelia and I are back from Saskatchewan so Blake's adventure
in single parenthood is over.  He was obligingly overwhelmed by
it — “I hardly had any time to read at all!”, and that's
with only one kid, and the easy one at that.  Yeah, keeping house
and raising babies is, in fact, a lot of work.  Who knew?  I am
only kind of being sarcastic here; I used to think I would feel
guilty about staying home until I realized how much damn work it
is.
</p>
<p>
But anyway, Saskatchewan.  We went to visit my parents, and the
timing was good because my dad just went into a nursing home
so my mom needed help with getting him settled in and getting
the house sorted out so she can manage on her own.  We cleaned
and sorted and went out for lunch and shopped (as much as you
can shop in Big River); it was a regular ladies' week.  Cordelia
was a huge hit with my mum; they read the Sears catalog and 
watched TV and looked at all the stuff my mum has.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia and I visited my dad at the home every day, and Cordelia
was a huge hit with the grannies and grandpas, with her big grin
and very loud observations.  “Dinosaur there!”  “See fishies!”
She also pulled out all the grandbaby stops on the last day
and gave my dad lots of nice hugs and kisses.
</p>
<p>
So there is a huge blog entry just waiting to be written, 
about this summer and how Delphine and Cordelia are doing,
about my thirty-second birthday;  all that narcissistic 
blather you have come to expect from this blog.  Whether I
will ever get around to writing that entry is yet to be
seen, but I have high hopes for this next month, what with
school and all.

Damn, I didn't realize I hadn't posted pictures since April!  I guess
it serves me right that it took over three hours to 
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/">get them posted</a>
this evening. 
</p>
<p>
My only excuse for this and all my other website slacking (and
general life slacking) lately is that I have had both Delphine and
Cordelia home full-time since mid-May.  This Friday Delphine 
starts kindergarten in the afternoons, and next Tuesday Cordelia
starts morning nursery school two days a week, so perhaps I will
have more time to do things.  That's if I don't wear myself out
schlepping them around.  We'll see!

The girls and I just got back from a week at the cottage — Blake
was there for the first few days but he had to come back for work
mid-week.  We stayed a full week and had a great time.
</p>
<p>
We stayed on the same beach as last year, but in a different
cottage; this one was further up the beach on a rockier bit,
which meant we had to trek down the road a ways to get to 
the sandy swimming beach.  The beach we were on, though — the
backyard of the cottage— had a sandy part for sitting and
reading or digging in,
and also lots of rocks for climbing and collecting and sliding on,
so it was by no means a disaster.
</p>
<p>
The cottage had two bedrooms on the main floor and another
double bed and single bed up in the loft, a little room 
amateurishly cobbled together in the rafters, accessible
by a ladder-like staircase.  Blake and I and Delphine slept
there for the first weekend; after Morgan and Erik and Blake
left the girls and I moved into one of the main floor bedrooms
and I got to experience the quiet but deep satisfaction of 
falling asleep to the sound of my children's breath.
</p>
<p>
The place was pretty cottagy; I don't understand this love
of wood panelling.  Nostalgia, I suppose.  Zaida went to
scope out a different cottage for next year.  It had been
freshly gutted and decorated with, you guessed it, wood
panelling.  Nice, new wood panelling.  
I would slap gallons of white paint around
if I had one of these places.  This cottage did have some
of the midcentury furnishings I favour; two beautiful
pairs of wood armchairs in a fine, elegant Danish style.
I couldn't get Blake to see past the orange vinyl on
one pair and green tweed on the other to appreciate their
airiness and elegantly tapered legs, though.
</p>
<p>
We spent a lot of time on the beach.  I stupidly got sunburned
twice but the girls weren't at all; they are just a little tan.
Delphine was a superstar in the water; by the end of the week
she was getting bowled over by waves and just picking herself
up and facing the next one.  Perhaps this is more interesting if
you know what a fraidy cat she normally is!  It's satisfying
to see her face her fears and enjoy herself.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia wasn't so hot on the water; I think she doesn't like
to be cold.  I have lots of pictures of her looking variously
forlorn, miserable, cranky and disgruntled on the beach.
(I will post pictures soon.)
Cordelia did have some fun playing with Zaida in the waves, but 
Zaida is extremely good at finding the fun for little people.
</p>
<p>
We ate well; barbecued ribs, burgers, chicken, and hot dogs; freshly
picked corn on the cob, watermelon, ice cream, new potatoes,
field tomatoes.  Beer.  Every day we tried to eat up the leftovers and 
every night the fridge was fuller than ever.
</p>
<p>
Baba and Zaida had some friends over on the last night we were
there, two couples.  Delphine was very apprehensive about meeting
them, but when I exhorted her to be brave she pulled herself
together and both girls were very nicely behaved and charming.
Another fear conquered!
Delphine took it upon herself to take care of Cordelia; when
Cordelia said she was done eating Delphine wiped her up with a
napkin, very officiously.  Delphine was also very happy to 
show the guests down
to the lake.  As a special bonus I
got to talk to adults about brainy things like computers and
books.  Hooray!  I need to make some new friends, or perhaps
just reaquaint myself with the friends I already have.
</p>
<p>
So another successful trip to the cottage, and Zaida already
has next year's cottage picked out.  We refine our requirements
every year; by 2015 we will have identified the perfect cottage.

Compared to the first half of this year, in the last couple of
months I've been reading like a demon!
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Dangerous Planet: Natural Disasters That Changed History</em>
by Bryn Barnard.</strong>  This is another book by the <em>Outbreak</em>
dude, and I didn't like it as much but probably just because I
have more of an affinity for disgusting pustulent diseases than I
do for scary natural (and other) disasters.  This book has the
same basic format; each chapter is dedicated to a different
disaster, describing how the disaster happened and how it
changed the course of history.  Among other things, Barnard
discusses the Great Fire of London and its effect on how buildings
and cities are constructed; the two (not one but two!) typhoons
which devastated the army of Kublai Khan and protected Japan
from invasion in the 1200s, leading to a certain sense of 
invincibility in the Japanese; and of course the classic
asteroid which wiped out the dinosaurs.
</p>
<p>
This book is beautifully designed and well-illustrated, clearly
written and informative.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Your Four-Year-Old: Wild and Wonderful</em> by
Louise Bates Ames</strong>.  I had to read this to see what it
had to say about four-year-olds, which my mom friends and I have
already observed are bossy and braggy as hell.  Ames agrees,
although she gives it a more positive spin; she says if you
can view your four-year-old's noisy, pushy arrogance with
as much amused detachment as you can muster the year will go
much more smoothly.
</p>
<p>
As usual the observations in this book are spot on, and very
helpful in distinguishing your child's personality from the
phases she's going through.  It gets a little dated sometimes
but that's part of the fun of it.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, the next book in the series is subtitled "Sunny
and Serene".  Hooray!
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Mac is Not A Typewriter</em> by Robin Williams</strong>.
I only read this because Blake had it out, and a lot of it was
stuff my brother taught me back in Grade 11 ("The Amiga is not
a typewriter!"); don't use underlines, don't use spaces when
you should use tab stops.  Williams also gets into fancy stuff
like Kerning, and she is very keen — perhaps
obsessively so — on curly quotes and em-dashes.  She uses 
some very strong words to describe straight quotes, words which
make me think I am dealing with an ill person and should perhaps
disregard her advice.  Really, they're quotation marks.
</p>
<p>
I am also leery— born perhaps of having been
introduced to computers through Unix in the early nineties — of
using non-ASCII characters, really ever, but especially in
email and on the web.  Williams even suggests using curly quotes
in filenames!  I'm sorry, I don't even use spaces in filenames.
That's craziness.  Excuse me, I am going to go and grow a long
beard now, and perhaps refrain from bathing for a few weeks.  I
must dust my green-screen ASCII terminal.
</p>
<p>
At the cottage last week I read <strong><em>Home Leave</em>
by Libby Purves</strong> which was fantastic and I loved it; it's
about four siblings, the children of a diplomat, who were hauled
all around the world when they were young.  It's about what home
means, and of course I related to the situation of having your
sibling as your only constant for your whole childhood.  There 
is a lot of talk of children and babies in the book and Purves 
writes so realistically and richly about children; they don't 
disappear or only feature as plot or characterization devices,
or worse just as noisy perplexing ciphers, as they so often do
in novels.  Purves knows how to write about how children
change you and affect you for better and for worse.  I loved the
characters and the stories and the ideas.  And
the ending; the ending was immensely satisfying.
</p>
<p>
I also read <strong><em>Pug Hill</em> by Alison Pace</strong>
which was pretty disappointing after the Purves.  This is a 
book about a thirty-one year old in Manhatten looking for 
love and sorting herself out.  The protagonist annoyed the
crap out of me with her whining and self-absorption and
judgementalness and immaturity, and she didn't get all that 
much better through
the book, although I think she was supposed to.  It was like
Bridget Jones in Manhattan, except blessedly free of talk about
dieting.

I am having some kind of stupid birthday crisis.  As I was
loading the dishwasher this evening I was ruminating on how
aggravating it sometimes is to have to share every single
little bit of your life with someone else.  I had just answered
the door to a charming young lady wanting me to sponsor a 
child, and I said no because I know Blake doesn't want to 
donate money to charities until we're out of debt.  If it
was just up to me I would probably give a little bit every
month regardless of debt; it's not like malaria is going
to take a break while we pay off our reno.  After bidding 
the charity girl good luck I went back to loading the 
dishwasher, which I have to do Blake's way because Blake
unloads.  Fair enough, and all this is perfectly reasonable
—I am by no means faulting Blake here, I couldn't ask
for a better husband.  It just gets a little tired 
constantly having to consider someone else, or in my
case three someone-elses.
</p>
<p>
After I finished the dishwasher I followed a link from my
<a href="http://dagbrown.livejournal.com/">brother's blog</a>
to <a href="http://mccorpsecorpse.livejournal.com/">this dude's
blog</a> to <a href="http://tvtropes.org/">TV Tropes</a> where
I spent an enjoyable hour or more reading about <em>Buffy</em>
and <em>Firefly</em> and <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> (though
perhaps I should not have read those spoilers), and
I really miss good TV.  I miss watching thoughtful, 
well-written shows, and
I miss going to work the next day and discussing them with
smart people, either live or online (yes, I spent far too
much time discussing TV at work, and I guess I will have
to remove <em>that</em> admission from this space before
I look for another job).    I miss having the time and the
spare 
emotional and intellectual resources to dedicate to TV shows.
</p>
<p>
And somehow (there may be some hormones involved)
that particular nostalgia has snowballed
irrationally into missing the days when I had lots of time
to play on the Internet, when my life was spent in a shiny
air-conditioned condo on a busy street and I took a train
to work and played on computers all day.  Now suddenly
my life seems to be spent playing in the dirt with two
messy, demanding, noisy, emotional (why, oh why must they be
two and four at the same time!) little people who seem
to have no interest in discussing Marti Noxon's Season
Six intellectual breakdown, or whether there is any 
point in improving Internet security technology as long
as it is still possible to adhere a Post-It note with
your password written on it to the side of your monitor.
</p>
<p>
Oh, I miss grown-ups.  I miss them so much.  I miss
air conditioning.  I miss meetings.  I miss lists of 
things to do that don't involve zucchini.  I miss 
computers and filesystems and data and logical problems
and whiteboards and deadlines and lunch rooms and 
that idiotic conversation about where we should go
for lunch this week.  I miss being something other than
Mom ("mudder", she calls me) and homemaker.
</p>
<p>
Being Mom is something that will never change, but one
day it will involve less dirt and hopefully more conversations
about Marti Noxon.  (Or actually hopefully not, now that
I think about it.)  And one day I will go back to work
and they will probably have outlawed air conditioning by
then, but there will be computers and meetings and 
deadlines and I will soon refresh my hatred for all three
things.  Life is all about balance — you have to hate
lots of different things to be truly happy.

    <p>Okay, I think the deck is officially done, and so it’s party time!
If you’re actually going to have a chance of making it here (sorry,
Dave), please <a href="houseandhome/reno/deck/july29.html">leave
a comment</a> or <a href="mailto:bwinton@latte.ca?Subject=Available%20Party%20Dates.">email
me</a> with the dates that work well for you, and I’ll see what works
