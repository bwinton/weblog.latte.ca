Not much to say, I just feel like being heard and I've been away from
the Suspects for so long it would be weird to just step back in and start
talking about myself.  Isn't that what blogs are for?
</p>
<p>
It's a partly cloudy day, and I feel my mood rise and fall precisely
with the appearance and disappearance of the sun.  Delphine is in the
middle of a long nap, and I should be doing housework but I'm catching
up on Mimi Smartypants and Dooce instead.  Morgan's coming over tomorrow
afternoon to babysit while I houseclean, so that has given me license
to slack off and play with the baby instead of trying to clean.  Which
is good because Delphine has a cold and she's needy and cranky and
really doesn't want to have to hang desperately onto my pants leg as
I try and wash dishes.
</p>
<p>
I'm coming down with a cold, too, probably the same one.  It's only
mild as yet, just a scratchy throat.  Hopefully I'll lick it quickly
and pass the antibodies onto Del so we aren't sick for too long.

I went to the doctor today for my annual physical.  I always enjoy
physicals because I'm generally healthy, and when else do I get to spend
forty five minutes talking with someone all about me! me! me!?
</p>
<p>
Everything's good; she gave me the go-ahead to work on another baby,
which is great if academic since I'm still amenorrheic due to nursing.
Apparently most women start ovulating while they are still nursing.
Also the average age difference between children when birth control
is not used is 22 to 28 months, and pregnancies started before that
are more likely to miscarry, although they're not sure why.  Interesting
facts which all basically mean we will let nature take its course, and
also that I will start taking folic acid now so I'm all ready to go
whenever my body is.
</p>
<p>
I also talked a bit about the arthritis that's developing in my hips.
There's not a whole lot they can do about that, which is a bit of
a pisser.  She said if there's a lot of pain, or I'm anticipating
some activity which will cause pain (like tennis, she said.  That'll
be the day.) I could take a prophylactic ibuprofen to inhibit the
inflammation which causes more joint damage.  Also, losing weight
is a great idea, she said.
</p>
<p>
And hooray, I'm down to 195 lbs!  I haven't seen this side of 
200 lbs lo these many years.  (I'm also down to a size 18, another
numeric milestone.)  I'm quite pleased that I'm still
losing even though I've been sitting at 2100 calories per day for
quite a while now.  The doctor suggested I should go down to around
1800 calories a day, so I've changed my goal in Fitday to 2000
cpd, and I'll work my way down.  
</p>
<p>
The challenge is going to
be eating properly; I have a tendency to skip real food in order
to save calories for treats like pastries and ice cream.  Such
a bad idea.  I'm going to try watching my food groups, making
sure I get 5 to 10 fruit and veg, 6 to 12 grain, etc etc.  I have 
to be in good nutritional shape to make another beautiful 
healthy baby.  I think it will be easier now that spring is
coming; fruit and salads always seem more palatable in warm
weather.  In winter I just want large piles of meat and potatoes.

First, Delphine is sitting next to me in her high chair eating
cubes of canned pear, using the Pincer Grasp.  One, grown-up
human food, two, the <em>Pincer Grasp</em>.  This is so cool!
</p>
<p>
Later I will find out that she has eaten only 20% of the pear,
and has dropped the rest between her legs where they will adhere
to her pants when I take her out of the chair.
</p>
<p>
Second, I'm still having some biggish thoughts about that 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/everythingelse/040204">thread</a>
I talked about before.  I made an alarming 180 on that topic
and I have more thoughts about it but I don't want to subject
the Suspects to any more of my mental masturbation, so I'll
do it here.
</p>
<p>
I started off the whole thread with a long weepy post, laden
with more rhetorical questions than a Carrie Bradshaw column,
about what I should do differently in order to be a proper
feminist, where I went wrong, and so on, all with the subtext
of <em>how dare you judge me unless you have walked a mile in
my moccasins?!</em>  So everyone talked about
that for a while, about the circumstances which lead women to
make the choices they do, about the chicken-and-eggyness of
the fact that women are usually the ones who make less money,
and so on.  
</p>
<p>
But everyone's situation is different, and everyone
can rationalize the choices they make, and as I thought about
it it became less about individual choices, and more about whether
it's appropriate to disapprove of a particular choice.  I
decided that it is appropriate; what I said in my next post was:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
The second-wave feminists did a great job changing the laws so 
that you can't discriminate based on whether you think someone 
you hire is going to have a baby, so that you have to pay men 
and women equally, and so on, but that's not enough. But 
once you have changed the laws, what more can you do? You have 
to create a social climate which encourages the change you want, 
and in this case that means judging women who do the traditional 
thing, criticizing them just a little. Making them take a harder 
look at their choices and see if there isn't something they could 
do differently, a more feminist choice they can make. Maybe 
they will decide that there isn't, but at least they will have 
thought about it.
</blockquote>
<p>
A real life example: I was having a conversation with a friend 
a while ago, and I 
expressed disapproval of women who change their names when they
get married.  My friend said "I'm going to change my name!"
and I told her I thought she shouldn't.  Is it any of my business?
Not really, no, but there I am having the opinion anyway.  I
can't change my general opinion because one friend is doing
something out of keeping with that opinion.
</p>
<p>
And maybe my friend will encounter three or four more friends
who agree with me, and maybe a newspaper columnist or TV character, 
and maybe 
she'll think a little more about changing her name, and decide
not to, because me and the other three people and the newspaper
columnist expressed our opinions.  Or maybe she's thought about 
it and will never change her mind, but at least she's been exposed
to this other point of view, and has considered it.
</p>
<p>
It's like gossip; I've read that gossip is how we share and refine
our values and sense of what is right and wrong.  Talking about
how other people live their lives is a vehicle for communicating
our ideas about how we think we should behave.  I guess
you could start a conversation with "So, Ellen, what are your
general thoughts on housekeeping?", but it's a lot more compelling
to say "Did you <em>see</em> the state of Linda's house?"  Or
"Did you see what Jodi was wearing?"
</p>
<p>
Or "Can you believe Jenn quit her job after the baby came?"
</p>
<p>
I guess you could assume that everyone has been exposed to the
feminist viewpoint, that everyone has thought all their decisions
through and is satisfied that they are in keeping with feminist
ideology, but that doesn't seem like a sensible assumption to 
make.  I suppose it's arrogant to see yourself as the feminism
fairy, sprinkling your political ideas wherever you go, but if
you think your political opinions are correct, why keep them to
yourself?  At the least, by talking about what you think you 
are exposing your ideas to the scrutiny of others, so they can
potentially be discussed and improved upon.
</p>
<p>
The problem with trying to apply general, one-size-fits-all
ideology to the career/baby situation is that it's a complicated
choice, with roots in the degree you chose in university, your
career path, the role models you had as a youth, your husband's
career path, your income, your environment.  There are too many
variables for the feminist choice to always be the right choice.
But if feminists make it generally known what choice they
favour, maybe young women will choose paths earlier in life
which make that choice possible later in life.  Isn't that what
it's all about?

It's Thursday at 6:14 pm.  Blake should be home soon, because he went into
the office early.  In the meantime, I'm sitting at the computer reading
the forum and nursing Delphine, who is in a crusty mood today.
</p>
<p>
She got the cold that I had, or maybe she got some other, unrelated cold,
but either way she's coughing and has a snotty nose, and for all I know
has a sinus headache like I did yesterday.  She's generally behaving 
sensitive; little things are setting her off in a way that they
don't normally.  Poor thing.
</p>
<p>
She's crawling, though.  Properly crawling, on hands and knees, not 
creeping on her belly.  Sometimes she still creeps, when she's on hardwood
and wants to go fast, and she's gotten really good at it; she looks like
a crocodile when she's going at top speed, little limbs splayed out
to right and left, her whole torso twisting from side to side.
</p>

<p>
I'm off to Florida to visit my in-laws next Thursday.  I'm only there for
five days, until the following Tuesday.  I decided I'd only go for a few
days because I don't really like Florida, am not really interested in 
shopping or sitting in the sun.  What I didn't consider when I made the
decision is that with Florida comes three full-time babysitters (my
mother-, father-, and sister-in-law), meaning
it will be as much of a vacation from mum-duty as any mother is ever
likely to have without actually having to be apart from her kids.  And 
I could really use the break.  I don't think five days will be enough, 
but it's too late to change now; next year I'll go for longer, and count
my blessings.

    <p>
So over on the board there is a thread going which has me
thinking.  It is a thread about whether women should stay at work after
they have kids, or stay home.  More accurately, it's about why more
women stay home than men, and whether each woman is obliged to get back
out there in the work force, and whether you're letting down all womankind
if you don't.
</p>
<p>
I started off okay, not feeling particularly defensive.  It was me
who pretty much started the whole thread because I took objection to
someone who posted about how she judges women who drop out, and how
they should feel responsible for the fact that employers don't like
to hire young women, and how they should worry that they won't be
able to get back into the workplace.  I think those three points are
lame, bullshit and not her concern, in that order, and so I called
her on it and we had a big conversation and it was all fine.  
</p>
<p>
And then someone else posted, and her tone somehow set me off in a 
way that the original poster hadn't, and I did start to feel really
defensive, but I couldn't figure out why.  I know that my decision
to stay home with Delphine was the right one, I am completely 
comfortable with it;  it would be ridiculous for me to go back
to my job I didn't particularly like, and put Delphine in someone
else's care, a notion I am not at all comfortable with, just to
attain some political ideal.  I explained that to myself in my head, 
I explained it to Blake out loud, but still I was bothered.
</p>
<p>
Then this morning it came to me.  I'm not defensive about choosing
to stay home, I'm defensive because I don't have a career.  If I
had a career, I would be working out a way to continue to pursue it,
because I would love it and want to get back to it.  But I didn't 
have a career, I just had a job.  And I'm ashamed of that.
</p>
<p>
I would like to have a career, the kind of career that
involves joining professional organizations, mentoring, being mentored,
going to conferences, going to training courses.  Being important,
having a career path, moving into management.  I think I <em>should</em>
have a career; I am smart, I am
organized and disciplined and committed.
I feel like I've let myself down, and yes, that I've let women down,
by not having one.
</p>
<p>
I still don't know, though, whether I screwed up in my last job.  I
didn't love it, and I consciously chose to make it a job instead of
a career.  Was the fault with the job, for not being lovable, or
me, for not finding a way to love it?
Should I have sucked it up and learned to love it, dug in and worked
hard and learned new things and sought promotion?  I had a couple 
of chances to move into product management that I kind of blew off
because I knew I didn't want to do the extra work, because I didn't
care enough.
</p>
<p>
So do I make myself care about any old job, or do I look for a job 
that I actually care about?  And how?  I still don't know.  I hope
I figure it out before the kids are in school, because I really would
like to start my career then.

Can I just say I love where music is going now?  We got the
Black Eyed Peas CD and it's all over the place, it's funk,
it's hip-hop, it's metal, it's pop.  And it's pretty much all
good.  I'm so glad to get some new music in the house, I was 
feeling pathetic and unhip listening to classical radio 
all day.  (Although for all I know, Black Eyed Peas are
pathetic and unhip; that's how pathetic and unhip I am.)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I'm feeling pleased with myself because I looked up
The Apl Song and figured out that the stuff which isn't in
English is Tagalog.  I guess if I were smarter I would have
listened to the English lyrics and caught the reference to
the Phillipines, but hey, with Google you don't need to be
smart.  Tagalog sounds cool, it's all bubbly and flowy.  I'd
like to speak it.

I visited my friend Ellen the other day.  Ellen lives in the 'burbs,
so you have to go all the way to the end of the subway line, and then
take a bus to get to her place.  So when I go, I put Del in the 
BabyTrekker and she dangles there, making googly eyes at all the
other riders.
</p>
<p>
Ellen was surprised when I arrived with Del in the 'Trekker; 
she's having trouble hauling Dexter around in the Bjorn because
he's so heavy.  I bragged that Delphine is 22 lbs, and that I can
carry her because I am so tough!  I am He-Woman!
</p>
<p>
But the next morning I did the math, and I realized that while Delphine
has gained 12 lbs since she was born, I have lost 22, so between us
we mass 10 lbs less than we used to.  I'm actually 10 lbs-worth weaker
than I used to be.

I made a mistake: I weighed myself last Friday at Morgan's place
- 207 lbs; and then again at Ellen's on Thursday: 210 lbs.  I knew
as I was weighing myself the second time that I shouldn't, that it
would be meaningless whether the number went up or down, but I did
it anyway.  And sure enough, I was disappointed when the number
was higher, even though the difference in scales, in time of day, the
small amount of time between the two weighings, all conspire to
make the difference all but meaningless.  And yet still I was
disappointed.
</p>
<p>
And it goes against the whole point of this Calorie-Control Initiative,
which was to control calories, not lose weight.  Somehow I let myself
start to enjoy the weight loss, to wist for numbers (195!  185!  Lower!)
or dress sizes (16?  14?  12?!) that I can't control instead of focusing
on the one I can control, the number of calories I eat.  And that's 
a recipe for grief.
</p>
<p>
I've decided I'm not going to cut down any more (I'm at 2100 cpd)
until I've talked to my doctor.  For one thing, the USDA is pretty vague
about where in the 1600 to 2200 range a not sedentary but not athletic type
like me fits, and for another I'm still nursing so I need more calories
than I otherwise would.  My final concern is that when I get pregnant
again I'll need to modify my intake up, and I worry that I'll gain huge
amounts of weight if my metabolism is all fucked up from going down
too low and then back up again.  So I'll
talk to my doctor and get her opinion before I go any
lower.  I have an appointment for a physical in early March.

I'm taking a sick day.  My head hurts and my nose is stuffed up and my
throat hurts and I'd love to go to bed, but when I do all my symptoms
get worse.  So I'm taking a sick day.
</p>
<p>
There's not a whole lot of difference between a
sick day and any other day when you're a stay at home mom and it's the
middle of winter, but it is distinguished from all other days as follows:
I am wearing sweats instead of real clothes.  I did not do my hair.  I
am not going outside, not even for choir practice.  I will not be feeling 
guilty about any housework I do not do.  I will eat for comfort (hello,
soup).
</p>
<p>
The bad news is that I still have to do laundry, although I don't think
I'll fold it, and I have company tomorrow evening so I'd better get 
better today so I can catch up with all the housework tomorrow.  The
other bad news is that Delphine does not honour my sick day and still
needs changing, feeding, playing with and cuddling at the usual times.
She is the worst boss I've ever had; I haven't had a day off since 
May 10.  The benefits are good, though.

I tried to cheap out on hand lotion (as I have already established, I
do not like to spend money on personal care items) and bought a huge
bottle of Jergen's moisturizer for five bucks, but it wasn't doing the
job.
My hands get desperately dry, they crack and bleed and the skin gets
thick and coarse, and this winter is worse than ever because I'm 
washing my hands all the time, and it's so damn cold.  The cheap 
lotion is about as effective as a ... something ineffective,
anyway, so I girded my loins to spend twelve bucks on a bottle of
sterner stuff.  
</p>
<p>
The first thing I picked up was a bottle of Eucerin
because their advertising had convinced me they were hardcore enough
to take on my hands.  I was about to head to the cash when I noticed
the bottle of Norwegian Formula, smaller, for the same price.  
I'd heard good things about from actual people (rather than ads), so 
I made a last-minute decision to get it instead.
</p>
<p>
When I got the bottle home I noticed the child-proof cap, surely a
good sign.  It must be powerful stuff if you have to protect your
children from it.    I read the label on the back: "Apply to  affected
area not more than 3-4 times daily."  Well!  Another good sign!
And it has Lidocaine;
I'm thinking this was twelve dollars well spent.  I have yet to see
whether it cures my poor miserable hands, but my hopes are high.
