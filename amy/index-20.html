Delphine and I have been reading some classic
chapter books about kindergarteners, like
<em>Ramona</em> and the <em>Betsy</em> books.
(By the way, if anyone can recommend any other
books/series in that vein I would love to hear
it!)  I am struck by how early these kids walk
to school alone: specifically, early kindergarten.
Ramona was written in the sixties and Betsy
was written in the thirties.  So, apart from
the cars which I agree are a concern, what has
changed in the world since then that prevents
us from letting our kindergartners walk to school?
Nothing.  But we don't because of some irrational,
formless fear that Something Bad will happen to
our children if we don't supervise their every
move.
</p>
<p>
I'm thrilled to find a website of people who
don't want to wrap their children in bubble-wrap,
and I'm astonished I didn't find it before now:
<a href="http://freerangekids.wordpress.com/">Free
Range Kids</a>.  I don't have time to read much
now but I'm looking forward to exploring this
website!  And in the meantime I might even let my
kids play in the front yard without supervision!
I'm a maverick.

(Delphine is almost five and Cordelia is two and a half and a month.)
</p>
<p>
It's 8:03 in the morning, and the girls are out on the deck.
It's about 10 degrees outside so they both have on sweaters,
and Cordelia has on mismatched wellies.  They are lounging
on the lounge chairs (the "relaxing" chairs) and playing
"Ah ah ah!" with a crow.  The crow says "Ah ah ah!" and
they say "Ah ah ah!" back.  Blake stood at Delphine's
window (which overlooks the deck) and said "Ah ah ah!"
and Cordelia started giggling.
</p>
<p>
Delphine loves to go outside every morning right after
breakfast, now that it has warmed up (the weather, not
breakfast).  She has explored
every one of the thousand square feet back there, and
she keeps track of what is growing for me.  Right now
the fiddleheads are coming up, and it's all I can do
to stop her from picking them all to eat.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia is at that stage where she 
overgeneralizes grammatical rules, so she "holded"
my hand or she "moveded" back.  (I'm not sure what
that double-suffix thing is about, but it's pretty
cute, in a Gollum-esque way.)  Anyway, that's
cute enough but Delphine has started doing it too,
which is awesome.  I like that she's learning things
from her sister, even if those things are wrong.
I'm sure they'll get sorted out sooner or later.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
8:17 am: Cordelia is sitting at the dining table
drawing with crayons.  She says "I'm drawin' a
hyclops!  The hyclops goin' to have hair..."
And she talks herself through the whole picture.
She likes drawing cyclopses because she's 
still at the stage where her drawings are mostly
circles and lines.  Circle, circle inside, 
two lines sticking out; ta-da!  Hyclops! 
</p>
<p>
Delphine is making pictures of all different houses.
She drew a condo, and a boathouse, and the roof of
a house, and a round house, and just a regular house.
</p>
<p>
This morning Delphine told me she had a bad
dream, but she changed it to be a good dream.  There
were monsters, and she had writing on her skin 
which told the monsters there was something inside
her, but she told the monsters that the stuff 
inside was stuff they didn't like, muscles and
bones, not something good like money and treasure.
Then she flew away, and the monsters couldn't fly.
She triumphs in her dreams!
</p>
<p>
It must have been a good night for bad dreams, because
Cordelia woke up twice with bad dreams, too.  Maybe
Delphine can teach her how to make her bad dreams
go better.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
It's 2:42 pm which means I should go and wake up 
Cordelia so we can go pick up Delphine.  Cordelia
has only been asleep for about an hour; I put her
down a little later than usual because there was
a guy here aerating our lawn and I had to pay him.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, this morning we went to the library to pick
up the thousands of books Blake and I had on hold,
and to get some books for the girls.  The girls got
another Alfie book by Shirley Hughes, and a few more
picture books.  I got a couple for Delphine from the
"Advanced Picture Books" shelf.  I must also remember
to order a new chapter book for her; we just finished
"'B' is for Betsy" by Carolyn Haywood.  We read
a couple of books while we were there; Delphine picked
out a book about a farmer, but she was very disappointed
when it turned out to be just a counting book.  She
is getting too old for probably about half of
the books in the picture book section of the library.
I think we might have to switch to a bigger library,
but I don't want to; I love this library and it's so
handy.
</p>
<p>
After the library we went to the toy store to get 
something for Ursa, who is turning 5 this weekend.
The girls were supposed to help me pick something
out, but they got distracted by the train set.
There was a little boy playing with the trains too,
and they did 'dinosaurs knock over the trains'
and 'look out, sheep, don't get hit by a train!'
and all kinds of other train/plastic animal hybrid
games.  I finally got them to help my pick some 
little things out, and we headed home.
</p>
<p>
Lunch was peanut butter and Marmite on leftover 
buns (I forgot to make bread <em>again</em>).  I
made Delphine a snack of oatmeal cookies and prunes
(no, she's not constipated, she just really likes
prunes) and we were off to school.  After I dropped
her off, Cordelia and I headed home, the lawn aerator
guy was here, and that's the end of that story, mostly.
After he was done I overseeded the lawn and seeded the
border we are converting to lawn.  I know, it's madness.
I need to come up with something better to do with my 
backyard, but
in the meantime grass seed is cheap.
</p>
<p>
Now I'm going to wake up Cordelia and get her something
to nibble on while we go back to the school to pick up
her big sister.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
Cordelia had a couple of oatmeal cookies to nibble on,
and I put her in the big double stroller to go pick up
Delphine. Usually we take a smaller stroller, but 
Delphine stubbed her toe really badly in the morning
so I thought she might need a ride home.
</p>
<p>
After school, Delphine stopped and played with her
friends for ages, as usual.  School is out at 3:15
but we're lucky if we get home before 4:15.  As usual, they
started off playing in the school play structure, 
sliding, jumping on the wobbly bridge, and, 
increasingly, climbing the various climby bits â€“
ladders, ropes, tires, and so on.  Then they moved on
to playing right at the far end of the playing field,
apparently in the dirt.  I think they like it over
there because they're so far away from their Mums
and grandmothers and so on.  Finally we Mums got 
them moving by promising a few minutes of play
on "Big Hill", the sloped lawn at the front of
the school.  (Obviously Delphine's 
toe was no longer bothering her.)  We finally
managed to leave with only some of the usual
hysterics, and came home to a dinner of pancakes
and bacon and mango and fried tomato.  Sometimes
I like to have breakfast for supper, just for 
fun.
</p>
<p>
We skipped bathtime in favour of
reading some books, and then it was into pajamas
and into bed by 7:15.  I make that sound easy,
but often there is some debate as to whether
and when it is necessary to put on pajamas,
brush teeth, tidy bedrooms or go to bed.  Usually
we all agree on reading a book or two, though.
</p>
<p>
Blake got home, as usual, sometime in the middle
of bedtime and joined in the mess of brushing
and reading and fighting.  After the Smalls were in
bed we Bigs took the laundry off the line and folded
it, cleaned the kitchen, Blake had his supper, 
we watched a couple of <em>Daily Shows</em> and
went to bed.
</p>
<p>
And that's a day in the life.

Spring has arrived with an unlikely two sunny warm days
in a row, over a weekend!  We celebrated by playing in 
the muck.  We raked most of last fall's leaves off the
front and back lawns, and I cleared off and weeded 
some of the north border in the backyard.  I pulled
out about a ton of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glechoma_hederacea">creeping
charlie</a>, which is surprisingly satisfying to uproot
when the ground is soft;
you can get hold of a bit without breaking the stem 
and then reel in about a foot of plant and roots, like
a magician pulling scarves out of a hat.
</p>
<p>
We also uprooted some of the many raspberries, and I cleaned
out some of the raspberry patch.  There are dozens of plants
there and it's hard to get the leaves and twigs and weeds
out from between them, to say nothing of trimming out the
dead canes, pulling out the millions of little suckers, 
and removing the raccoon poop.
I think the smart thing to do with the raspberry patch will
be to thin it out as well as reduce its overall footprint.
The previous owners must have really like raspberries.
</p>
<p>
There are lots of little things growing, but the only things
flowering yet are crocuses.  I'm not sure what the other
things are so I'm looking forward to their flowers.  Some
tulips I planted last fall are coming up in the front yard;
Delphine is very excited about that because she helped me
plant them.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most remarkable accomplishment this week was that
Blake built a frame for our 
<a href="http://www.squarefootgardening.com/">Square Foot Garden</a>.
That's a technique for vegetable gardening whereby you plant
your entire garden in one (or more) four-by-four foot squares.
We picked out the spot for the garden and Blake was poking 
around in the shed and found four perfect four-and-a-half foot
planks, which he screwed together into a frame to delineate
and protect the garden.  I say this casually, as if Blake
screws things together to make other things all the time, but
if you know Blake you know that just isn't so.  He is not 
what you might call "handy".  However, he made a perfectly
lovely frame without swearing or drawing blood, so I think
he might be handier than either of us suspected.  The frame
is gracing our garden and waiting patiently for some nice
compost and lots of seeds.

Wow, I didn't realize I hadn't updated my book log since 
August.  That's insane!  Book log updates take a long
time, so I guess I put off doing them, but eight months?
Here are the books I read from August to the end
of last year, and I'll post this year's books in another
post.  One day.  Maybe in August.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Three Junes</em> by Julia Glass</strong> was a
vacation read I borrowed from Baba, and it was a great book.
I am looking at all the notes I made on it after I read it,
and sadly despite having written the notes and now reading
them, I don't remember much of the story, which doesn't reflect 
well on my attempts to read more attentively and remember
what I read.  Anyway, it's one of those novels with dozens
of different characters whose lives intersect in interesting
ways.  The characters are beautifully drawn and the intersections
of their lives are plausible and enjoyable to read about.

I sound like an idiot when I try and write about fiction!  Maybe
non-fiction too.  Oh, I wish I were smarter.  You would think
all this reading would help.

<strong><em>Get Smart: Nine Sure Ways to Help Your Child Succeed 
in School</em> by Ronald Dietel</strong>.  I think I picked this
up because it was on display at the library.  That is to say, I
didn't order it especially, and I'm not worried about Delphine's
academic development or anything.  I'm not even particularly 
worried about whether she "succeeds" in school; the question of
whether getting good grades can be considered succeeding is very
much up in the air for me at the moment.  Anyway, that's now,
but back in September when I read this book I thought it would be
cool to know how to help my kid succeed in school.
</p>
<p>
Dietel starts by commenting on the fact that apparently there is
no time to be a kid any more, and there's big pressure on even the
smallest of children to succeed in school.  "The words 'let them be
kids' are becoming a faint echo of the past."  And that's all he
says.  He doesn't say that sucks, he doesn't say you should be a
counterpoint to the pressure in your kid's life, he doesn't say 
maybe achieving in school isn't the be all and end all.  And I guess
he wouldn't!  If he felt that way I bet he would have written a 
different book.
</p>
<p>
He goes on the talk about the different factors which affect your
kid's success at school (specifically: ability, effort, attitute, 
school quality,
teacher quality, school learning habits, home learning habits, evaluations,
communication).  And then for each factor he talks about how you can 
affect and improve it, varying from study techniques to working with
your kid's teacher to homework routines.  It was a pretty useful book,
for what it was.  I am older and wiser* now than I was when I read the 
book, and have some different
perspectives on school and learning and how much involvement I
should have in my kid's life, so even though I only read this book
a few months ago I think I would approach it a lot differently 
if I read it today.
</p>
<p>
* I am older and wiser now mainly because of a book I just read
called <em>Punished by Rewards</em> by Alfie Kohn which has blown
my mind and made me rethink everything about interacting with my
children, but in the best possible way.  I will post about it 
sometime.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Not-So-Star-Spangled Life of Sunita Sen</em> by Mitali 
Perkins</strong>; another just-picked-it-up choice.  This is a 
young adult novel about an Indian-American teenager who is 
torn between her traditional grandparents and her desire to
be an ordinary American girl.  I generally liked the story
and the message of the book, but I am spoiled by all the
Canadian books I usually read and was really put off by all
the American references.  I don't see why an American book 
shouldn't have American references, but there's something nice
about books set in Canada.  They're easier to read.  I expect
the same is true about books set in Sweden if you're Swedish.
I also though that Sunita's boyfriend's exoticization of Indian
culture was kind of creepy, but it was presented positively in the book. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance</em> by 
Atul Gawande</strong> is a book about how to succeed in medicine,
or any endeavour which involves risk and responsibility.  Gawande's
three core requirements for success are Diligence, Doing Right
and Ingenuity.  He illustrates them with fascinating examples
from the field, from the difficulty in getting people (doctors!)
to wash their hands to the subtleties of conduct in the examining
room, to the near-magical improvements in neonatal survival
after the introduction of the Apgar score.  This is a wonderfully
written, interesting and thought-provoking book, whether you
are a doctor or just want to be smarter and better at what you
do every day.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, here are Gawande's five "Suggestions for Becoming
A Positive Deviant":
</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask an unscripted question; be interested in someone else,
surprise them, learn something about the people you see every day,
find their humanity.</li>
<li>Don't complain; it drags you and everyone else down, it is
unhelpful and boring.</li>
<li>Count something, track something; be a scientist in the world.
If you count something you find interesting, you will learn something
interesting.</li>
<li>Write something; add some small observations about your world;
step back and think about a problem; make yourself a part of the
larger conversation.</li>
<li>Change; respond to new ideas; recognize the inadequacies in what
you do and seek out solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Find something new to try, count how often you succeed, write about
it, ask people what they think.  See if you can keep the conversation
going.  These are words I try to live by, even in my relatively small
world.  I strive for constant improvement.  That sounds really dorky,
but it's true.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>How Doctors Think</em> by Jerome Groopman</strong>.  Another
fantastic book!  It's great when I get two good books in a row.  This
is a fascinating book about, as it says, how doctors think, and mainly
how they diagnose.  Groopman talks about the inadequacies in medical
training, how doctors feel about you as a patient, how they come to
their conclusions and how they can get stuck in stereotyped views of
you and your condition.  Most importantly he writes about how you can
ask questions to understand your doctor's thinking and perhaps gently
steer them in a different direction if you feel like they are not giving
enough thought to your condition, or if you just want to understand
their diagnosis better.
</p>
<p>
Everyone who is a patient should read this book, and doctors should
too.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Simple Home: The Luxury of Enough</em> by Sarah 
Nettleton</strong>.  This is mainly house porn; lots of pretty pictures
of "simple" houses; houses that are exactly as big and complex as they 
need to 
be, and no more.  Pretty and inspirational.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Supernanny: How To Get The Best From Your Children</em> by 
Jo Frost</strong>  and <strong><em>Nanny Wisdom: Our Secrets for Raising 
Healthy, Happy 
Children â€” From Newborns to Preschoolers</em> by Justine Walsh 
and Kim Nicholson</strong>.  I read these books because I was looking
for inspiration on how to discipline Cordelia, who was just getting
into a bit of a hellish phase.  Both books favoured timeouts, which I
tried and which failed miserably because Cordelia would either be
completely happy on the "naughty step", or Delphine would go over and
comfort her.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, otherwise these are pretty good books which emphasise what I
consider to be the cornerstone of good parenting, a structured routine.
They also both give a shoutout to an early bedtime, another parenting
tool which I think is sadly underused these days.
</p>
<p>
However, I wish the <em>Nanny Wisdom</em> nannies would stick 
to general parenting advice 
and stay away from advice on nursing, which is... well, it's none of
their business and they don't know what they're talking about.  They
say you should stop nursing at a year and they say that at some point
your milk dries up and your kid is just nursing for pleasure.  Which
is not true at all!  They clearly overstepped the bounds of their
own expertise there.  If you want good nursing advice, the book for
you is <em>Breastfeeding Made Simple</em> by Nancy Mohrbacher and Kathleen 
Kendall-Tackett.  Not some nanny book.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Finding Flow: The Psychology of Engagement with Everyday 
Life</em> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</strong>.  Flow is what you
experience when you are completely involved in what you are doing, 
when you feel simultaneously focused and transcendent.  It doesn't
happen very often, and Csikszentmihalyi has studied when it happens
and how.  This is a book about how to fully engage in life, how
to live without waste of time or potential.  If you don't believe
in an afterlife then you know we've only got maybe eighty years
of consciousness, and you'd better believe I don't want to waste
any of mine.  This is a wonderful book about finding happiness
and fulfillment, sometimes where you least expect it (like at work!).
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Factory Girl</em> by Barbara Greenwood</strong>.  
Barbara Greenwood is a lady in my choir who writes really neat
history books for children, which combine historical facts with
a narrative.  She tells the story for a few pages and then breaks
off and talks about the facts behind the story.  This was an
interesting read for me because it made me realize how much I
bluff when I'm reading historical fiction. For example, the character
in the book works in a sweatshop that makes shirtwaists.  Sure,
shirtwaists, I thought!  Cool!  It was only three pages later when
Greenwood breaks out and says, in effect, "Here is what a shirtwaist
is" along with a few illustrations out of the Eaton's catalogue, that
I realize I had no idea what it was, really.  Similarly she tells
what, specifically, you could buy with the girl's meagre pay.  I
found this to be a very effective teaching technique; I
think you're more likely to ask questions about what you're reading
if you know that the answers are coming up, and I think these
books encourage curiosity.  I look
forward to reading more of Greenwood's books with the girls.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Bones to Ashes</em> by Kathy Reichs</strong>.  This was
better than the last Kathy Reichs.  I think I need another go-to 
mystery writer, though, because Reichs continues to annoy with her
sentence fragments and her "it's on the tip of my tongue" intuitive
mystery-solving.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Send: The Essential Guide to Email for Office and Home</em> by 
David Shipley and Will Schwalbe</strong>.  This was useful but I can't
remember exactly what I learned that I didn't already know.  Oh, I guess
I learned that it is considered okay to put the entire message in 
your subject header (if your message is short).  That always annoys me,
but I guess if no-one else minds I'll have to put up with it.  Also 
apparently you are only supposed to have one topic per email; if you
want to talk to someone about two things you should send two emails.
That sounds really maddening to me, but I have learned from experience
that some people just don't read (or comprehend) more than one
item or paragraph in an email message.  Also I suppose having one topic
per message might make it easier to file, if you're a dinosaur and you
still use folders instead of tags.
</p>
<p>
And that's the end of my 2007 reading!  I can't believe Cordelia is still
asleep!  I might even be able to post about what I've read in the last
three months sometime before the end of April.

It's day three of March break, which I have been looking forward
to for a while.  As I might have mentioned a thousand times,
taking people to and from school is the thorn in my side for 
this winter, so a week of unstructured days where we don't have
to be anywhere in particular are any particular time sounds
awesome.  I'm also glad to say I haven't turned into one of
those Moms who is scared to face a week or even a day with
her kids.  (One of my favourite examples is an acquaintance
from school who has bought her kid millions of toys but "has"
to schedule her for activity after activity because she 
is "bored" at home.  My kids aren't allowed to be bored.)
</p>
<p>
So on Monday we had a friend of Delphine's over and they
did the usual dressing up and jumping on the bed and 
drawing pictures and stuff.  I threw together some 
lunch and then Delphine went over to the friend's house
while Cordelia napped and I ... I don't remember what
I did.  Read, maybe?
</p>
<p>
Tuesday we had a huge impromptu March Break Pizza Party.  
I had invited my friend Ellen over with her three, 
and my friend Tanya invited herself over (she's allowed
to do that) with her two, and she in turn mentioned
to a friend, Anna, that she was coming, and said friend
invited <em>her</em>self over (she's not really allowed
to do that but we have been muttering about getting
together sometime, and she's moving to England soon
so it's not like I need to worry about something awkward
developing.)  Anna has two boys, so altogether there
were nine children (two babies, three toddlers and
four kindergartners) and four Mummies.  We tossed 
the eldest out into the snow for a while where Jake
(the senior kindergartner) gave orders and pulled 
people around on the sled.  The Mums juggled babies
and made pizza and talked some awesome talk (I love
smart people) and then we hailed everyone in and fed
them all.  Then all the kids played upstairs.  It was
an interesting dynamic; they are all three and four and
I swear they spend eighty percent of the time discussing
what they were going to play and what the rules were
and whose rules they should use, and maybe twenty percent
of the time actually playing, usually chasing each other
and screaming.
</p>
<p>
Gradually people left (but not without cleaning the
kitchen first!) until it was just Tanya and me and ours,
and we agreed it was good fun but not something you'd want
to do every day.
</p>
<p>
Today I declared Toy Sort-Out day.  We brought every toy
in the house down to the dining room along with the assorted
boxes and bags and things they go in, and put everything
where it's supposed to be, creating new categories and 
boxes (with labels) as necessary.  I am trying to train 
them to be organized freaks like me.  It was hard work but
it only took the morning.  After lunch Delphine and I "rested"
on the couch (with the TV on) while DeeDee napped, and now 
they are outside painting the snow with food colouring-tinted
water, and making snow cookies with the sandbox toys I dug out.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow we're venturing downtown to the Gardiner Museum of
Ceramic Arts, and Friday is still wide open!  Maybe we will go
tobogganing in the park.  What are you doing for March break?

<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2l7me3">Here's an article</a> from Scientific American about how
a focus on your kid's effort â€” not their intelligence â€” is the
key to success in life (and school).  The bottom line is, either
your kid believes that she's smart and successful because she was 
born that way (a fixed intelligence mindset) or she believes she's 
smart and successful because
she works hard and practices (a growth mindset).  In either case,
eventually your kid is going to run into something she can't
succeed at effortlessly.  If she has a fixed intelligence
mindset she will give up on that thing, assuming
that it's just something she's not good at.  If she has a growth
mindset she will just try harder and harder.  Children with
fixed mindsets will also be scared to try new things, and to make
mistakes, for fear that they will be "outed" as someone who isn't
so smart after all.
</p>
<p>
So your kid needs to know that intelligence isn't intrinsic but
is something that can be changed and improved, and she needs to
know that being intelligent isn't much use without a good dose
of hard work and courage.  That's why I am not impressed when
my kids are smart; of course they are smart.  It's what they
do with themselves that I am interested in.
</p>
<p>
This issue is close to home for me because I grew up with a
very fixed mindset and it has taken me years to shake it.  It
also caused me to make some decisions I still regret now.  
Basically every time I wasn't instantly successful at something
I would give it up, and I was absolutely petrified of making
mistakes, so I never took any risks.  I 
would like my children to be bolder, less fearful of failure 
and mistakes, and to work harder than I did as a child.  (And
as an adult, now that I mention it.)
</p>
<p>
Here's an interesting paragraph from the article for Kat â€” this
ties into something we were talking about the other day:
</p>
<blockquote>
Mind-set can affect the quality and longevity of personal relationships as well, through peopleâ€™s willingnessâ€”or unwillingnessâ€”to deal with difficulties. Those with a fixed mind-set are less likely than those with a growth mind-set to broach problems in their relationships and to try to solve them, according to a 2006 study I conducted with psychologist Lara Kammrath of Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario. After all, if you think that human personality traits are more or less fixed, relationship repair seems largely futile. Individuals who believe people can change and grow, however, are more confident that confronting concerns in their relationships will lead to resolutions.
</blockquote>

Oh, incidentally I got the link from
