<p>Last night a friend asked me why I was excited that
Barack Obama won the American election.  Why, as
a Canadian, do I care?  I couldn't really begin to
explain in a Twitter post, and I was tired, but
I thought about it as I went to sleep and here is
what I have come up with.</p>
<p>I like Americans.  I know lots of them and I like most
of the Americans I know, and for a long time I have been
perplexed by the apparent gulf between "America" and 
the American people I know.  Last night's victory 
closed that gulf; it seems America the country is
a lot more closely aligned to the beliefs and hopes
of the America I know than to the vocal minority of
fundamentalist and fear-mongers we have heard from
of late.  And thank goodness for that.  So I am very
happy for my American friends, that finally their
government reflects them.</p>
<p>I like what this victory says about America.  I have
a friend who was predicting a McCain win: "The young
people won't wait in line to vote", he said.  "The 
early results with show a strong lead for Obama and
everyone else won't bother to vote", he said.  There
was an argument put forth that Americans <em>say</em> to
pollsters that they would vote for an African-American,
but then in the privacy of the polling booth their
secret inner racist comes out.  I am glad those
arguments were wrong.  I am glad America got excited
about its future and came out to vote in droves,
many for the first time, many waiting in line 
(or on line) for hours.</p>
<p>Why am I glad?  Because Americans are people, and
people are the same everywhere, and if Americans 
can get excited about democracy and step up and do
the right thing, it makes me feel better about people
everywhere.</p>
<p>I'm glad Barack Obama won because he ran an honourable
and decent campaign.  Everyone pisses and moans about
negative campaigning, mud-slinging and pettiness, but
it seemed, until now, inevitable, like the weather.
Obama has proved it's possible to win an election
with a positive, optimistic campaign.  (Okay,
maybe rather vague, but vague in a positive way.)
While McCain and Palin were screechin' and spittin',
fear-mongerin' and fist-shakin', Obama maintained his composure 
without condescending.  This is a great lesson for
American politicians and a great lesson for politicians
everywhere in the world.  The bar has been raised.</p>
<p>Obama is smart.  Really smart, and America is crying
out for a smart person in the White House.  Why
does this matter to me as a Canadian?  Because I
am excited to have someone in office who has a hope
of understanding and acting on 
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2008/11/how-green-will-president-obama.html?DCMP=ILC-arttsrhcol&amp;nsref=specrt12_head_Green%20White%20House">climate change</a>, a global issue if ever there
was one.  Where America leads, the world follows
and we desperately need someone to lead us in the
right direction on this matter.  (Apparently Canada
isn't going to do it.)</p>
<p>It's not just climate change.  The world faces
numerous potential global threats: a flu pandemic,
a disaster in our fragile food distribution system,
terrorism, peak oil.  Not to mention whatever the hell
is going on with the economy.  It's fine, I guess, to have
a numbskull in office when there's not much to do,
but when anything could happen I am much happier 
knowing that there is someone in the most powerful
position in the world who has a hope of really understanding
the situation, consulting with the right people and making
an informed decision without resorting to dogma and
superstition.</p>
<p>And I'll admit it: I got caught up in the excitement of
the moment.  (I still am; I am dying to sit down and
watch the Stewart/Colbert special from last night!)
Obama is the "other" to so many Americans: he is
black to white Americans, he is educated to uneducated
Americans, he is foreign-raised to Americans who have never
left the country, he is the son of an African to 
slave-descended Americans
(although I never heard anyone talk about that), he
is the son of an atheist and a lapsed Muslim to
Christian Americans, he
is erudite and witty and Northern and liberal(ish); he
is so many things that we have heard that Americans
aren't (Real Americans, that is) and yet America voted
for him.  That so many people were able to see past
the things they don't share with Barack Obama
and see in him the best of their common humanity
stirs in me great pride and hope
for what has been and could again be a great nation.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here are some more links:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obama could be <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/dn15130-obama-promises-new-era-of-scientific-innovation.html?feedId=online-news_rss20">great for science, yay.</a>
</li>
<li>Here's <a href="http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/dn15134-obama-on-science-in-his-own-words.html?feedId=online-news_rss20">Obama on science in his own words</a>
</li>
<li>The wonderful Dale McGowan points out that Obama is the <a href="http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/blog/?p=1078">first 
  American president raised in a non-religious
   household</a>
</li>
<li>Mr Crankypants (PZ Myers) sounds the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/the_glass_is_half_empty.php">voice of pessimism</a>.  I tend to agree with his commenters -- can't we have just one day of irrational exuberance before we get real?  (Mr Crankypants posted a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/context.php">follow-up comment</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know if Barack Obama is going to be as shiny as his
most enthusiastic supporters make him out to be.  I don't know if any
mortal could be.  But I am excited about what this
election says about America and I am optimistic
about the future.  Why not be?</p>

<p>Yesterday Blake taught Delphine about contrails.  This
morning we were out walking and she looked up into the
clear blue Hallowe'en sky and saw a plane.  "It has a
cotton-trail!"</p>
<hr>
<p>We were talking about everyone's costumes.  "Mrs
Thompson was a lady who works in a
church.  The ladies who wear necklaces with a criss-cross
thing on."  I love that my kid doesn't even know
what a cross is.  (Mrs Thompson was a nun.)</p>
<hr>
<p>Cordelia and I were reading <em>Dr Suess's ABC</em>:  "Big
A, little a, what begins with A?"  </p>
<p>"AMY!"  </p>
<p>"Aunt Annie's alligator, A..a..A.  Big B, little B, what
begins with B?"  </p>
<p>"BLAKE!"  </p>
<p>"Barber, baby, bubbles, and
a bumblebee."  And so on with Cordelia chiming in
whenever she knew someone with that letter.  After
C ("CORDELIA!"), D ("DELPHINE!") and E ("ERIK!") she
said "Almost everyone we know has a letter in this
book!"</p>
<p>Yeah, almost!</p>
<hr>
<p>Delphine and I were talking about meat today, because
we were walking over to a friend's house to pick up
a quarter cow.  She asked if someone killed the cow, 
and I said that they did.  </p>
<p>"That's sad.  We should
be nice to animals."</p>
<p>"That's true.  But then we couldn't eat meat."</p>
<p>"Meat is tasty."</p>
<p>"Some people don't like to kill animals, so they don't
eat meat.  They're called vegetarians."</p>
<p>"But meat is so tasty!"</p>
<p>"I know!  It's a hard decision to make."</p>
<p>So we talked about how Daddy and I decided to keep
eating meat but to try and make sure that the cows
and chickens and other animals we eat are happy
when they're alive, hence the trek to pick up 
cow.</p>
<hr>
<p>Not my kid but my friend's kid (and my kid's friend)
Ursa.  Yesterday they were eating a Chinese beef
dish and Ursa said "I like this dark brown chicken!"
(Good thing, because they got a quarter cow too.)
What's the deal with kids thinking everything is
chicken?  The other day Cordelia called tilapia chicken.
The kids at daycare used to call tofu chicken.
No wonder everything tastes like chicken, it's because
chicken tastes like everything!</p>

<p>Our school website contains a list of handy Hallowe'en
safety tips, among them the old chestnut about
inspecting kids' candy before they eat it.  I suppose that wouldn't 
hurt, but it might be interesting to know that there
has never been a case of random poisoned 
Hallowe'en candy.  There have been a few
reports of candy with pins, and apples with
razors, but the vast majority of those were hoaxes
or pranks.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of links from the valuable 
Snopes website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.snopes.com/horrors/poison/halloween.asp">On poisoning</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.snopes.com/horrors/mayhem/needles.asp">On needles and razors</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps it seems harmless to continue repeating
these needless warnings, but I think it breeds 
cynicism and fear, which we have far too 
much of.  (Don't even get me started on "Stranger
Danger".)</p>
<p>(I'm going to have to think further about the appropriateness
of cynicism and/or fear with respect to Chinese
candy.)</p>

<p>We're in the midst of the fall festive season, and
as anyone who is less than four feet tall knows, 
that means it's Hallowe'en.  Both Delphine and Cordelia
are very excited, and it's clear that Cordelia
remembers a thing or two about last year.</p>
<p>Delphine is planning to be a penguin this year.  We haven't bought a penguin costume; rather we
are hoping to kludge something together with 
a white shirt and a black hoodie and orange 
construction paper beak and feet.  I hope it
works because we haven't had a chance to
try it out and we're running out of pre-Hallowe'en
weekend.  Delphine has a pretty convincing penguin
waddle which would sell the lamest costume,
though.</p>
<p>Cordelia has independently decided to be a black
cat.  For a while there she was going with
ghost and I thought we would have to find and
then butcher a white sheet â€” you always see
that white-sheet-with-holes ghost costume in
cartoons and stuff but I've never seen it
in real life.  I thought it would be cool to try
it out.  But about a week ago she switched
to black cat, so I dropped a whopping $19 on
ears and a tail, which together with black clothes
and some eyeliner whiskers will make a convincing
and adorable cat.</p>
<p>The great thing about Hallowe'en is that it gives
you lots of chances to talk about such topics of 
childhood interest as death and scary things.  Last
year we spent a lot of time talking about being dead
and what death is (and who Death is â€” a house around
the corner has an inflatable Grim Reaper).  This year
we are leaning more towards Hallowe'en imagery and
what is scary.  Delphine wanted to know why someone
had fake gravestones on their lawn.  "Gravestones
aren't scary", she said.  I said they mark where dead people
are buried, but she was unmoved by that because to
her mind dead people aren't scary.  And of course 
by extension, skeletons aren't scary either.  What
<em>is</em> scary?  Witches, spiders and ghosts are apparently
scary.  I don't think bats are and rats definitely 
aren't, although we did decorate with black rubber 
rats.</p>
<hr>
<p>Delphine likes Monopoly.  I know, weird.  I wouldn't
have occurred to me to put her in front of a game of
Monopoly, but my friend Tanya, who is nothing if not
ambitious with what she exposes her kid to, brought it
over and Delphine loves it.  She loves the money: she
likes to sort it out, stack it up, pay for things and
get money from other people.  She likes choosing which
piece she will be, and she loves to move around the
board.  She got tired of it, though, after maybe forty minutes,
and started acting up.  "I'm so bored of giving people
money!"  Yeah, tell me about it.  So for Christmas I
got her <em>Monopoly Junior</em>.  I'm normally not in favour
of kiddified versions of things, but this looks like
it retains the main elements of the adult version
(including the lovely money) but goes faster.  Plus
the setting is a carnival, not some boring old city.
Delphine loves carnivals and fairs and things.</p>
<hr>
<p>Cordelia went for her birthday sleepover at Auntie
Morgan's house this weekend.  Unfortunately I have
no idea what they did because Cordelia said she had
fun but she didn't want to talk about it.  I know
what Delphine did, though, because she stayed home
for what we have termed a "sleepunder", which is
what you get when you're the sister who stays
home and has Mum and Dad to herself.  Mostly we
played Monopoly.  Delphine chose KD for supper, and
we read lots of chapters at bedtime because we
didn't have to put Cordelia to bed.  In the morning
Delphine decreed that Blake should get up early (that
is, when Delphine and I got up) and join us for a 
breakfast of French toast and pancakes.  Then more
Monopoly, and then we went out to get Cordelia back.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, the thing with Blake getting up with us turned
out abysmally.  Usually he stays in bed for an hour
or more on weekend mornings while I get up with the
kids and make breakfast and read the paper.  Having
missed that extra sleep, however, he was logy and 
grumpy all day.  He napped twice but it didn't help.
God knows what he's like during the week, but from
now on I will gladly let him get his morning beauty
sleep.)</p>
<p>The sleepunder was lovely.  Unfortunately at the moment the girls
are much more pleasant to be around one at a time than
together.  Delphine alone is insightful and contemplative
and interesting, Cordelia alone is funny and clever and
demonstrative.  Together they are whiny and scrappy 
and tiresome.  Not all the time, but often enough that
it wears me out.  Hopefully between them they will eventually
grow out
of it and figure out how to enjoy each other's company
more.</p>

<p>My dad died today at 4:15 am Saskatchewan time, which is
6:15 am EST.  So fifteen minutes before I woke up this
morning my dad was quietly dying two provinces away.</p>
<p>My mom called at 6:37 am to tell me.  I was only half-awake,
and so my first thought was "How did they know it was
4:15?"  My dad wasn't on any kind of life support, so 
barring the unlikely event that someone was in the room
with him and noticed him go, 4:15 is surely just a 
best guess.  Which is fine, really, but my early morning
pedant wanted that to be clear.  4:15?  Really?  Or
'around 4:15'?  Which is, I'm sure, exactly what my
mother needed!  </p>
<p>Actually apparently what she thought I meant
was "How did they know he is dead?" which is a 
valid question because lately the difference between
my dad dead and my dad alive has been a subtle one.
When we all went to see him in August he was largely
unresponsive, and in an unguarded moment (I have a 
lot of them) I described him to the girls as Mostly
Dead.  Which he was.</p>
<p>So now he's Completely Dead, and it's a bit weird how
that's so very different that him being only Mostly Dead
at, say, 3:15 this morning, while also being so much the same.
My brother and I and probably my Mum are having trouble
with this state change, this passing from being Mostly Mourning
to Completely Mourning.</p>
<p>Right now the girls are with their Baba and I suppose
I should be doing grown-up things like getting a flight
home, but really I just feel like baking a giant batch
of cookies and sitting down with a magazine and some tea.</p>
<p>One last whine â€” our terabyte drive crashed so we don't
have any music, and I don't have a single Requiem on 
my ipod.  Not Mozart, not Faure, not even the fairly
alarming Brahms we started practicing yesterday.  So
I'm stuck listening to some random mass, which is nice
but not the same.</p>

    <div>
<p>It's cool today, and rainy, but I opened the doors and
windows anyway, because it's the last day of summer vacation
and I want to get as much of that summer air in the house
as I can before we get back to the routine of walking here,
walking there, packing snacks, hurrying up and going.  This
year I have got myself yet more taking and fetching to do
in the form of an eight-year-old boy I'm looking after 
before and after school.  He won't make much more work for
me (I think, unless he turns out to be horrible, which
I'm pretty sure he isn't) and he makes me quite a lot more
money, so I expect that will be a net win.</p>
<p>But that's what's happening next, and I wanted to post
about what we did this summer.  </p>
<p>The first thing we did in summer vacation was a trip to
the ROM, on the very first day after school ended.  Getting there
turned out to be quite an ordeal; the subway wasn't running,
so we tried in various ways to outsmart the crowded
shuttle buses; we took the number 11 back to Mount Pleasant,
tried to catch a Mount Pleasant bus (almost lost Cordelia),
then got back on another number 11 which magically turned
into a Yonge Street shuttle.  (We missed the most 
obvious workaround which is to take the normal 97 Yonge 
St bus.)  All
our fooling around killed enough time that they managed
to get the subway running again by the time we got to St
Clair, and we were back en route.</p>
<p>After all that we had a nice visit to the ROM, and saw both
the Darwin and Wedgewood exhibits.  Because my mother is
from North Staffordshire of course we think we're related
to both Wedgewood and Darwin, so I particularly enjoyed 
the exhibits.  For that reason and also  because both Staffordshire
pottery and evolution are particularly close to my heart.
And did you know ceramics and fossils have similar
chemical properties?  It's all connected.</p>
<p>I mentioned we almost lost Cordelia, but what I should say
is that she almost lost us.  We were all standing at the
corner waiting for the bus, and the girls were fooling around
on a little staircase, hanging on the banisters, walking down
the hill, the usual fidgety little kid stuff.  Suddenly Cordelia
took off running in the opposite direction, crying and shouting.
I wondered if perhaps she had been bitten by something, or
seen a scary dog.  I shouted her name but she didn't turn around,
so Blake took off after her.  She was running full-tilt so she
got half a block before he caught up with her, and apparently
she had lost track of us and thought we had lost her.  She was
petrified!  She has a fear of being left behind or leaving
someone else behind â€” if I don't stop and wait for Delphine
while we're out walking she screams "Mummy 'top!" â€” and I 
guess she panicked and forgot to, oh, look around a full 360Â°
before running for it.</p>
<p>Another adventure was a trip downtown to have lunch with Daddy.
I wasn't sure whether simply going downtown would be enough
excitement for two little kids, but Delphine kept saying "I love
downtown!"  We went to Queen and stopped at The Bay for some 
kid undergarments, and then walked along to John to Grange Park.
Delphine and I had already walked along Queen a few weeks earlier 
when we went to the ballet, and I think she got a kick out of
seeing places again.  "This is where they always have a ice
cream truck and a french fries truck!"  We stopped for a snack
on the landscaped median of University, under the statue of
Adam Beck who apparently invented hydro-electricity.  Apparently
it still isn't cheap enough, because the fountain at his feet
wasn't running.  As we were sitting, Delphine looked up and
said "That building says 'Canada Life'."  Which it does!  She
reads everything now, signs and the writing on trucks and 
labels, which I remember doing as a kid and apparently Blake
did too.  Actually I still do it; if it's printed I have to
read it.</p>
<p>One of our goals for this summer was to go out on a boat, 
so one fine Monday morning the girls and I went down to the 
Harbourfront.  We walked along the boardwalk admiring the
boats and ships, and looking for ducks, until I found someone
selling boat rides.  I asked him which was the cheapest one, and he
said we could all go out on the Ste Marie for $11; it was 
to be a 45 minute ride leaving at 11:15, so we signed on.  We
turned out to be the only passengers on a tour around the 
Toronto islands; we saw nature preserves and Centre Island,
swans and cygnets, and learned all about Ned Hanlan.  Delphine
won herself and Cordelia a lollipop each in a one-question trivia
contest: "What lake are we on right now?"  "Ontario Lake!"  I
had told her that very morning.</p>
<p>Our biggest adventure this summer was a surprise trip to
Saskatchewan, surprise because I had intended to go at
Christmas until I realized it would be fully twice a much
money, to the tune of $4000 instead of $2000, to go at
Christmas instead of summer.  So we decided to go in 
August instead.  I flew out there with the girls first,
and my mother's saintly friend Shirley picked
us up from the airport in Saskatoon.  Blake came a few days
later, and picked up a rental car and drove to Big River 
by himself, almost without incident!  </p>
<p>Shirley also engineered
the high point of the visit, a fishing trip in her
motor boat.  Delphine got to reel in a fish, and I also
fished for the very first time.  Blake caught the biggest
fish of the day, but we released all of them in favour of
some already-clean fish from Shirley's freezer.</p>
<p>We managed to stay quite busy in Saskatchewan, going out
for lunch a couple of times, driving down to PA to see an
old school friend, going to the school playground, visiting
the farmer's market, shopping in Debden, or just going to
get the mail.  The girls had a great time with my mum; she
let them watch as much TV as they wanted, eat cookies and
play with all her thousands of tchotchkes.  Blake said
that between the cookies and fishing and <em>Wheel of Fortune</em>
and <em>Jeopardy!</em> it was just like his visits to his grandparents
in Winnipeg when he was a kid.</p>
<p>We also visited my Dad in the nursing home a couple of times.
Last year, when Cordelia and I were in Sask in September, my dad
had just moved into the nursing home and we visited every day.
We chatted with him and had a nice time.  This year I literally
didn't recognize him at first: he was tucked up in a giant
bed-like wheelchair and he had lost a lot of weight.  With his
teeth out he just looked like some generic old guy, skinny and
wrinkly and not like
my dad at all.  It took a minute to recognize that nose and
those ears, things that don't change, and then I realized
that old guy was really my dad.  </p>
<p>The first day we were there
he didn't open his eyes or acknowledge us at all, apart from
tapping his foot apparently in response to the songs that
the girls and I sang for him.  I was so
shook up it took me a couple of days to gather the nerve to go
again, but when I did I was sorry I had waited, because Dad
opened his eyes and looked at me and the girls and smiled at us.
But the next time we visited, again he didn't open his eyes.  All
I could do for him was ask the nurses to play music for him.</p>
<p>While we were in Sask the hospital called my mother to let her
know that they are discontinuing his diabetes medication because
he's not eating.  I know my poor Dad is just trying to go, and
there's no legal way we can make it easier for him.  Humanity my ass.</p>
<p>The girls took it all in their stride.  They asked why Grandpa
doesn't talk or open his eyes, and I said he's really old and
sick and he needs to sleep all the time.  I said he's too tired
to open his eyes or talk.  They weren't upset about it at all,
because they are still young enough that they take it in their
stride, and because neither of them really knew him when he was
lucid.  Dad got to meet Delphine when she was three, but I don't
know how much of that either of them remember.</p>
<p>My mother, on the other hand, is doing well by herself.  She
has friends and neighbours who help her out with things like
mowing the lawn.  The people in town â€” the pharmacist, 
the postmaster, the plumber (just like in a Richard Scarry book)
â€” know her and look out for her.
And of course she has her cats to torment her and keep her
on her toes.</p>
<p>I remember when the children were younger the travel itself
was the big worry, but there was hardly anything to talk about
this time; I loaded up with activity books and little 
plane-friendly toys â€” a magnetic dress-up doll, some brilliant
Micro Playmobil in its own little box, sticker books â€” and
plenty of snacks, and we managed the three hours on the plane
and two and a half hours in the car without much ado.</p>
<p>Since we got home from Sask we haven't had any  grand adventures, although
we have had a steady stream of playdates and visits.  School
starts next Wednesday and Delphine is looking forward to it.
She was scared that she wouldn't like her teacher, until she
received a welcome letter from said teacher in the mail and 
now she's excited and happy.  Cordelia's school starts the
following Monday â€” she's doing Monday, Wednesday and Friday
this year.  I don't know how that's going to go; she has
been very clingy lately.  I expect she will howl terribly,
I will leave and she'll be fine within five minutes.  I
expect further that after a couple of weeks of school
she will no longer be so clingy.  There's nothing like
confronting your fears, even when you're two and your mother
makes you do it.</p>
<p>I think this has been a great summer.  At the beginning I
wondered if I should have enrolled my kids in a thousand
camps and programs, like everyone else does (nevermind that
we don't have the money).  I decided I would rather not
spend my entire summer ferrying everyone around, and that
we would make our own fun, and so we did.  There was a 
little whining that there's nothing to do, that we never
go to the park, that our backyard is the worst in the world,
and that everyone else gets to go away on holiday, but for the
most part we got along with each other and found interesting
things to do both near and far.</p>

<p>Yesterday was my thirty-third birthday.  Thirty-three
isn't a very interesting number, but it's one of the 
ones you have to get through on the way to ooooold.  </p>
<p>Blake's first present to me was to tell the girls
not to fight on my birthday.  If you know any 
two- and five-year-old sisters you will know how
long that lasted, but they did try.  For at least
an hour.  The next nice thing was that Blake let
me languish in bed while he went downstairs with
the girls and made tea and toast for me.  </p>
<p>After
breakfast we opened presents: Delphine got me a
strand of blue silk flowers and beads on a wire,
to decorate things with.  Cordelia got me a wire
and bead ladybug (and then broke it, but not 
fatally), and Blake got me a Moleskine notebook
for Writing Things Down In.  I loved everything.
Blake thought I might not like the girls' things
because of their tchotchke-like nature, but it's
surprising how much I completely adore them just
because my girlies picked them out.  I put the
blue flower garland on the banister and I put the
ladybug... well, I put it up high.  Hopefully I 
can put it somewhere else soon.</p>
<p>Despite it being my birthday we still had a million
errands to run (partly because we're going to 
Sask next week) but I had a nice time.  I spent
far too much money on clothes for Delphine (but
they were on sale!  And so cute!) and far too much
money on a present for my cousin.  We met up with
our friends Tanya and Ursa and continued
the tradition started last year of 
decorating cupcakes (which is to say,
burying them in as many sprinkles as they will hold).
Tanya and I got some very rare talking-together-like-grownups
time while the little ones slept and the five-year-olds
played with Playmobil.</p>
<p>After Tanya and Ursa left, Blake came home with 
KFC (my annual treat) and more presents!  A
beautiful <a href="http://www.basil.nl/assortiment_detail.asp?titel_var=2&amp;lang=3&amp;id=1864">Basil pannier</a> and the Torchwood
season one DVD!  He tried to get the latter 
signed, but I'm glad he didn't manage it
 because I would have
died of jealousy if he had met John Barrowman 
without me.  Well, maybe not died, quite.</p>
<p>Then more company; Kat came over and watched
our TV while the children were in bed, and we
went for a walk and had coffee.  We came home,
watched the first episode of Torchwood (I think
we may have converted Kat) and went to bed.  </p>
<p>All
in all, a super birthday, but my first full day
of being thirty-three was fabulous too.  Kat 
stayed over and we went to yoga together in the
morning.  Yoga was fun, as usual, but my hamstrings
are astonishingly tight and there were some postures
I couldn't even consider.  As usual, though, yoga
threw me some ego-boosting soft pitches:  I can balance!
I can ... well, mainly  I can balance! But there's a
lot of that in yoga!  The thing I like about yoga is 
that you might try a posture one minute that seems
completely impossible â€” you look at the person next to you
and wonder if perhaps there is some optical illusion
involved â€” but the very next posture is something you can
not only do, but do the "if you want a little more challenge"
variation!  Yoga wants you to feel good.</p>
<p>But the best thing of all was that today Delphine
learned how to ride a bike!  She went off with Blake
to practice riding in the school ground, and when they
got back she was riding all by herself.  I could
hardly believe my eyes!  This summer has been
great for her; she learned to climb a tree, she is
reading (not entire books but words and phrases), and
now riding a bike.  Wow!</p>
