<h4>Part II: Blake</h4>
<p>There's something slightly weird about me posting about
the other writer of this shared blog, but whatever.  This
is the wifely perspective on Blake's life.  </p>
<p>So Blake is in some kind of between-job limbo, fortunately
punctuated by contract work which we assume will be lucrative
once he gets paid.  There's a vague job offer in the offing
but nothing has been signed yet.  Limbo indeed.</p>
<p>The working from home is going pretty well, I think.
We don't have a home office, per se, in that our house
has six rooms (three bedrooms, bathroom, kitchen and 
living/dining) so he's set up in the bedroom, on 
Baba's antique sewing machine.  It's a pretty sad
 state of affairs and it wouldn't work in the long
term, but it will do for now.  He also takes breaks
in the living room, and sometimes gets out of the house
and works at U of T (where he Knows People) or Starbucks
(where he Spends Money).</p>
<p>Apart from the working he spends what seems to be
a lot of time on his own programming projects and on
open source projects.  (I say "what seems to be" because
for all I know he was spending the same amount of
time on that stuff when he was at the office and I
just didn't see it).  He also reads lots of books (but
not as many as me because he's not insane) and listens
to a lot of podcasts.  A huge number of podcasts.  Mostly
really geeky ones about programming languages, comics and
role-playing games.</p>
<p>Despite Blake being laid off in these Trying Times, we're pretty
optimistic.  Our spending habits are pretty sensible, and
the future looks bright.  And like Blake says, we have a lot
of available credit.  Hah.</p>

<h4>Part I: Our Routine</h4>
<p>It's the middle of January, and January sucks.  It goes on and
on forever and ever, and it's bloody fracking cold this year.
I mean really cold, and I'm tired of it.  I know it gets cold and
it snows every year - this is Canada - but I hate it.  I hate the
bundling up and the having to hurry everywhere outside, but 
mostly I hate the sheer discomfort of being cold.  I am a big
baby.</p>
<p>The girls and I are still doing what I like to call 
<em>Der grosse Schlep</em> on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  We take
Cordelia to school for nine, pick her up at 11:30, have lunch
and then take Delphine to school for 12:40.  When Delphine is
at school Cordelia takes a nap, and then we pick Delphine
up at 3:20.  This massive to-ing and fro-ing was supposed to
be a little easier this year because Baba and Zaida bought
a condo halfway between Delphine's school and Cordelia's,
which was to be our waystation and lunch room.  However, the
condo is still (still!) not finished.  I am hoping it will
be done before the end of the school year, but my breath is
not held.</p>
<p>On the other hand Blake's quasi-employed status is proving to
be very helpful.  I can leave Delphine at home while I take
Cordelia to school, and pick her up, and after lunch he puts
Cordelia down for her nap while I take Delphine to school.
This makes for much less putting on and taking off of snowsuits,
and of course I can travel much faster alone.  Hopefully by
the time he gets back to work, snowsuit season will be over.</p>
<p>Apart from the main schedule, which revolves around school,
we have some other stuff going on too.  In the fall both 
girls had gymnastics, and now we're in Music Together on
Saturday mornings.  (In order to keep our schedule manageable
we do an annual rotation of activities: gymnastics in the 
fall, music in winter, swimming in spring.)  Delphine also
has Sparks on Wednesday evenings at 5:30, which let me say
is an insanely bad time for an activity.  We have to leave at
5:15 and we're not home until 6:45, which (when bedtime is
at 7:00 is far too late for dinner.)</p>
<p>The other regular rhythm to our life is that after school
the girls watch two (2) TV shows.  I was pretty hardline on the
TV thing for a long time, but an essay in that Alfie Kohn
book convinced me that TV isn't inherently evil, and 
Delphine's getting to the age where TV is a significant
part of her peer culture.  And Blake and I watch and 
enjoy our TV shows - I try not to be too much of a hypocrite.</p>
<p>That's our routine these days.  It's going to be like this
until the end of the school year, and then next year life
will be significantly easier because Cordelia will be
in JK at the same school as Delphine.  Hooray!</p>

<p><strong><em>Village Life in England, 1860-1940: A Photographic Record</em></strong> <strong>by 
Johnathan Brown and Sadie B. Ward</strong> is a collection of early
photographs of life in rural England.  The book includes hundreds of pictures
accompanied by descriptions, and divided into categories:
school, work, domestic matters...  It was just there on the shelf, 
it looked neat so I picked it up.  Lots of interesting pictures,
if you like this sort of thing, and the text taught me a lot about
the fate of village life as more and more people moved to the
cities: basically the villages became either bedroom communities,
or theme parks for town folk looking to get away on the weekend.
  My favourite picture was the one of two village lads wearing 
their work clothes, with their sleeves
too short, tiny pockets up high on their waistcoats, exactly like
the hobbit costumes in <em>Lord of the Rings</em>.  (I guess those costume
people know what they're doing.)  </p>
<p><strong><em>You Know What They Say: The Truth About Popular Beliefs</em></strong> <strong>by 
Alfie Kohn</strong>.  Debunking and Alfie Kohn, two of my favourite things 
together in the same book!  Kohn takes on dozens of common misbeliefs
and aphorisms: do birds of a feather flock together or do opposites
attract?  Is it never to late to learn, or can you not in fact teach
an old dog new tricks?  Are no two snowflakes alike?</p>
<p>The book is pretty old, which means on the one hand it hasn't worked
because most people still believe the stuff he tries to clear up,
and on the other hand a couple of the beliefs he discusses have
been further researched and the latest research actually supports
the belief.  Specifically, there has been more research on whether
being cold causes you to catch cold, and it seems that being cold,
or at least having cold feet, can <a href="http://www.edwardwillett.com/Columns/oldwivescolds.htm">increase your susceptibility to
cold viruses</a>.
That's the great thing about science, you never know what's gonna
be true tomorrow.</p>
<p>A couple of the chapters I just didn't believe, like the one
about PMS which scientists apparently don't (or didn't) have
any evidence for.  I'm pretty sure the misery I feel before
my period comes is materially different from the misery I
feel the rest of the month.  It's the difference between
soul crushing depression and, say, the disappointment I
feel when they're out of sour cream glazed at Timmy's.  It 
just feels different.  Hopefully they've done some better
research since the book was published, but I expect the
pharma companies just decided to declare PMS an official
disease so they could sell us crap to cure it.</p>
<p>That apart, I really enjoyed reading the book, because I 
love to get the story straight on everything, and also 
because I like Alfie Kohn so
very much.  He's smart, he's funny, he's a skeptic and a thinker
and a humanist.  I might even send him some fan mail, I like him so much.</p>
<p>Oh, and I think it's kind of funny that two of the popular beliefs
were "Rewarding people makes them do better work" and "Competition
builds character", both of which he then expanded into entire books of 
their own.</p>

<p>It's Thursday morning, which means no-one has to go
anywhere until Delphine's school starts in the 
afternoon.  This is good news because it's minus
ninety-five outside and I don't want to go out, 
but it's bad news because the girls have to 
negotiate each others' company all morning.</p>
<p>This morning they were doing Arts and Crafts.  Delphine 
is miffed because there's an Arts and Crafts afterschool
program and I didn't sign her up for it, but
fortunately she's pretty sensible so she
deals with it by doing Arts and Crafts (you 
can hear the capitals when she says it) on the
dining room table with Cordelia.  This goes well
for a while until Cordelia doesn't comply with
some requirement of Delphine's and the yelling 
begins.  Delphine is quite bossy: "You have
to draw a face on this person or I won't make
you another person!" </p>
<p>Cordelia is very stubborn: "I don't want to 
draw a face!"  Except Cordelia's
voice is very high and loud, and she isn't so 
good with consonants, so it's more like "I
DON WAN DRA FAY!"  Which is enough to get anyone's
ire up, and Delphine has a short temper as it
is, so Delphine crumples up whatever it was that
needed a face and declares that she doesn't want
to play any more.</p>
<p>I point out that if they don't want to play together
they each have their own bedroom, so Delphine goes
upstairs.  Cordelia starts to follow her.  "Don't
follow me!  I don't want you!"  Delphine slams her
door.  Cordelia tries to open the door and then
yells "I can't open the door!"  Well, "I CAN' OPE'
THDAH!"</p>
<p>I yell up "If Delphine has her door closed she can
have some privacy!" and Cordelia starts up with her
heart-rending sobs.  When this kid cries she puts
everything into it and you'd have to be made of 
granite to not feel bad.  She collapses on Delphine's
door.  "I love you Delphine!", she wails.</p>
<p>And then the door opens.  "I love you too, Cordelia."
And they hug, and now they're making worlds out of
buttons and Lego and cotton balls.</p>
<p>Friends, enemies, friends, enemies.  I think the
only thing harder than parenting sisters is being
one.</p>

<p>About six years ago I received in the mail a small tub of
NeoStrata AHA cream with 10% glycolic acid.  It was
sent to me by a friend who had tried it to cure her 
acne with no success.  To my surprise, shortly after I
started using it, my skin cleared up.  The clogged pores
that made my forehead into a shiny billboard of braille nonsense
disappeared, along with the pimples which had been with me
since high school.  I never had terrible acne, but I always
had one or two or three pimples on the go at a time, and
I always made it worse by picking.  Pick pick pick.</p>
<p>But once I started using the new cream, for the first 
time in my adult life I had clear, 
smooth almost-alabaster skin.  It's a small thing and
I feel like I shouldn't be so vain about it, but it was 
nice to walk around and not be self-conscious about
my skin.  Before the acne went away I thought I would
feel prettier if I didn't have these spots, and
as it turns out, I was right.  I felt prettier and 
more confident.</p>
<p>So every time I ran out of the glycolic acid cream I
went for a few days without it, just to make sure that
I wasn't wasting my money, and sure enough within a
couple of days the clogged pores would pop up on my
forehead, a sure harbinger, I thought, of the pimples
to come.  So off to the store I would go to spend another
$35 on the magic cream.</p>
<p>But now the pimples are back, just like before.  I have
a scar on my chin where I picked one last week, I have
a scab on my forehead and another at my hairline, and
I have a new pimple brewing on the other side of my
chin.  <em>Exactly</em> the same as before: same kind of pimples,
same places.  My skin is doing the time warp.  I actually
wore makeup the other day.  I never wear makeup!</p>
<p>So what changed, I asked myself.  I am using exactly the
same beauty routine as I was three months ago: plain soap
and the glycolic acid stuff.  What changed?</p>
<p>Then I realized: Cordelia stopped nursing.  Yeah.  I 
started using the glycolic acid cream when I was a few
months pregnant.  Then I had Delphine, then I nursed her,
then I got pregnant with Cordelia (without giving up 
nursing), had her and nursed her, until a couple of months
ago.  And then the acne came back.  But not the clogged
pores!  Apparently the cream cured them but wasn't 
actually having an effect on the acne.</p>
<p>It's almost funny (haw haw) how much time and money
and grief I spent between the ages of thirteen and
twenty-seven, trying to get rid of these pimples.  All I 
needed to do was get knocked up!  Ha!</p>
<p>So next time I go see the doctor I will ask her about
trying one of those birth control pills which cure
acne as a "side effect".  Since pregnancy cured it, 
perhaps something which feigns pregnancy will have
the same effect!  We'll see.  In the meantime I will
try and stop picking.</p>

<p>So (obviously?) I've been thinking a lot about my beliefs
(or lack thereof) lately.  I came across this good quote
today from Dale McGowan, the guy who wrote the book about
raising children without religion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though I’m sure they exist, I have never yet met an 
atheist delusional enough to say he or she knows God does 
not exist. Atheism simply means “I don’t think God exists.” 
It is a statement of belief, based on the evidence as we 
see it, not one of certainty. But agnostic is too often 
misunderstood as a 50-50, “dunno, don’t care” position. 
That not really an agnostic, it’s an 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheist">apatheist</a>. I said 
that I am a teapot agnostic, then explained 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot">what that is</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually <a href="http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/blog/?p=1578">the whole post</a> 
is really good.  Anyway, I think I might lean towards apathetic
agnosticism, except that I find this stuff quite interesting to
think about.  And I quite enjoy not believing in stuff, which
isn't very apathetic of me.</p>

<p><strong><em>Three Day Road</em></strong> <strong>by Joseph Boyden</strong>.  This was my 
over-New Year's Day book.  Joseph Boyden is kind of shiny
here in Canada these days because he just won some 
award, I think for his next book.  Okay, okay, I did some
research: he won the Giller Prize (sorry, that's the
Scotiabank Giller Prize) for <em>Through Black Spruce</em>.</p>
<p>This book is about two Ontario Cree who sign up to
fight in WW I.  Actually the book starts when one of
the men returns, and it's told mostly in memories,
the soldier's memories of war and his elderly aunt's
memories of her life.</p>
<p>I would have to say this was a very good start to
a year's reading.  It's a good story, I learned
a whole lot about World War I (which isn't saying 
much because I know next to nothing about World
War I anyway) and got lots of insight into Cree
culture, another embaraassingly large hole in
my knowledge, considering I claim to be from
Northern Saskatchewan, some of the time.  The
book is beautifully written.  I'll have to check
out <em>Through Black Spruce</em> too.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ja, No, Man: Growing Up White in Apartheid-Era 
South Africa</em></strong> <strong>by Richard Poplak</strong>.  Poplak was
born in 1973 and lived in South Africa until he was
sixteen, and ended up in Toronto.  I was born in
1975 and lived in South Africa until I was seven,
and ended up in Toronto.  So I thought this book would
be a cool read and might fill in some holes in my
memory and my understanding of my childhood.
The <em>Globe and Mail</em>
loved this book, and I too love the book.  It's hilarious
and again, very educational (apparently there are
no limits to my ignorance).  Poplak crams in a 
lot of South African history among his droll tales
of corporal punishment and weird racism.  This 
book made me really thankful we got the hell out
of dodge when we did.  It also made me laugh out loud.
(Dave, you should totally read this too.)</p>
<p><strong><em>It's All Too Much: An Easy Plan for Living a
Richer Life with Less Stuff</em></strong> <strong>by Peter Walsh</strong>.
I'm not sure exactly why I keep reading 
organizing books, because it's not like I'm drowning
in clutter.  I can have close friends and family
over almost without notice, and visits from 
less-close friends only call for maybe half an
hour of picking up and cleaning the bathroom.
So it's not like I'm a giant household screw-up.
But it's true that it wasn't always like this.
Our apartment was pretty hideous, and it has taken
me a long time to recognize how much ongoing effort
it takes to keep a house clean and tidy.  </p>
<p>The other thing is I like is to have less stuff, and
to only have the right stuff, and that's what this
book is really about.  Rather than just dig in to
all that <em>stuff</em> Walsh insists that first you think
about what you want from your life, what your dream
life really looks like.  Then he gets you to think
about what you want from your home, and then he gets
you to break it down by room.  For each room in your
house Walsh asks you to make a list of desired 
functions in the room, and get
rid of everything in the room which doesn't meet 
one of those functions.  Once the room is clean,
you designate a physical area for each function,
and then put everything away in the appropriate
area.</p>
<p>This is a good notion and something I might implement
sometime, to some extent, but I think the best 
thing about the book is the yearly schedule of
stuff to do to keep your place in line once you
have sorted it out.</p>
<p>Two other nice things about this book: lots of
anecdotes.  I love anecdotes.  Second Walsh has a
bunch of neat tricks for figuring out whether
you use stuff: turn all your hangers inside
pointing out, and only turn them back when you
wear the item outside of the house.  At the end
of the year, get rid of the clothes which are
still pointing the wrong way.  Or: masking tape
all your Tupperware closed and only untape it
when you use the Tupperware.  After six months
(preferably six months including Thanksgiving
and Christmas) get rid of all the Tupperware
that is still sealed shut.  Or, move all your kitchen
gadgets and utensils to a cardboard box and only
put them away in a drawer when you use them.
If you don't use them in four weeks, toss them.
I don't agree with that time-scale; I have 
useful kitchen tools that I use less often
than four-weekly, but then I think I'm more
of a cook than his target audience, who apparently
can't find their kitchen counters under junk 
mail and clothes that don't fit.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a good book; I enjoyed reading it
and it's helpful too.  I'm slightly embarrassed that I
have so much to say about this rather unsophisticated book and
apparently no more than a paragraph or two to say about the
real books I read.  I'm tired!  And I have rather more hands-on
experience with domestic organization than I do with apartheid
or Cree culture or WW I.  Not much excuse, I know.  Maybe I
need to work on being smarter.  Some more.</p>

<p>First off let me say I got one of my wishes: a computer of my
own!  To be sure, it's an ancient Toshiba laptop with no mouse,
running XP, but beggars can't be choosers.  It's a computer,
and it's so gnarly no-one else will want to use it!</p>
<p>Today is the last day of Christmas holidays.  At the beginning
of the two weeks off school, Delphine was pretty miserable.  She
likes school better than home, probably because school notably
lacks an annoying little sister.  Also school is thick with
structure and full of activities: she never has to wonder what
to do next at school.  So she and I both were a little nervous
at the start of the holiday.</p>
<p>The first weekend we attended the annual Party Across The Street,
the party the whole block goes to.  All twelve houses worth!  Delphine was feeling sick, though, so she only stayed for a little
while.  Sunday she was feeling better and good thing too, because it
was the first day of Hanukkah and we had my friend Kat over
for latkes and cabbage soup and some <em>Doctor Who</em>s.  We scared
the crap out of her with <em>Blink</em> and that one with the 
gas mask kid.</p>
<p>On Monday Delphine and I left Blake and 
Cordelia behind and went downtown to do some Christmas shopping.  Delphine 
has only been downtown a few times, not counting
swimming lessons on Bloor and Riverdale Farm, so it is still
a big adventure for her.  We went to the Eaton Centre, shopped
in vain for a winter jacket for Zaida, got some presents for
Daddy and had sushi and ice cream.  Delphine ooh-ed and aah-ed
at the Swarovski crystal Christmas tree, and at the fountain.
I told her the secret to finding a nice clean, empty bathroom
when the mall is busy (go to the top floor of one of the 
department stores), and we bought me some underwear.  Yay!</p>
<p>On Tuesday we went tobogganing with friends, which is to say we all
went to the park and then I peeled off to do some errands.
I meant to be back in time to toboggan, but by the time I
was finished shopping everyone had retreated to our friends'
place for lunch.  (It was the book store, the book store always
takes longer than you think.)  Then Delphine stayed at said 
friend's house for the rest of the afternoon for some
getting-away-from-little-sister time.</p>
<p>The next day was Christmas Eve.  Due to in-law difficulties (not
with my in-laws, though) we had decided to have Christmas Dinner on 
Christmas Eve, at Baba and Zaida's house.  (I know, there's just
something weird about Christmas Dinners at Baba and Zaida's
house.  We're a modern family.)  However, I'm obviously the
big Christmas maven (heh) around here and Christmas Dinner
is my baby, so I sent over three giant bags of food and 
equipment in Zaida's car in the morning, then drove myself
and the girls crazy cleaning our house while Blake worked.  It was a
pretty rotten morning but it was the only time this whole
Christmas season when I got stressed and overwhelmed, which
is a big improvement over last year when pretty much all of
December sucked.  After the house was clean enough I shoved
the girls over to Baba and Zaida's in a very unseasonable 
rainstorm, and Baba took over childcare/napping while I
cooked away.  I did prime rib (part of our quarter cow), roast
potatoes and Yorkshire puddings and gravy, and Baba did green beans.
For afters we had Christmas pudding (I made five Christmas 
puddings this year!  That might be too many!) with brandy
butter and whipped cream, and some of the vast selection of
cookies baked by Baba's friend Bob.  Bob starts baking in 
September or October and bakes, like twenty different kinds of
cookies and bars, and then disseminates his handywork to all
his friends.  Hooray for Bob!</p>
<p>After dinner we headed home and did all the Santa juju, with
the cookies and port (no milk for Santa at our house, we do it
English-style), and stockings hung
on doorknobs (Delphine) and dining chairs (Cordelia. Don't ask
me, it wasn't my idea) with care.  Delphine declared she was going to stay
up and wait for Santa, but Delphine couldn't stay up if there 
were a real live pony in it for her, and within ten minutes
she was gone.  Then I got down to the real hard Santa work
and finally crawled into bed by ten thirty or so.</p>
<p>The nice thing about having children who wake up really early
normally is that you're used to it, so when they wake up
really early Christmas Day it's not such a shock.  We had
coached the girls that they should open their stockings
<em>before</em> waking us up, so we got to sleep until 7.  Christmas
Day unfolded as it should, with some stocking opening, a light
breakfast, opening some presents.  The whole family and 
a friend came over for brunch, catered by Morgan and Erik, 
and there was ample sitting around talking and eating more
cookies and the traditional Terry's chocolate orange and
giant Toblerone bar.  Finally everyone left, and there was
more present opening.  Delphine declared herself to have
received too many books and activity books (and to be
sure, she did receive plenty of both) but I think she
ended up pretty happy.  Her favourite thing was a sewing kit
I put together out of some sheets of felt from the dollar
store, some fine yarn, actual grown-up needles and actual
grown-up scissors.  Actual grown-up stuff is a huge deal
when you're five.  I think Cordelia's favourite thing was
the baby doll she got from Baba and Zaida (technically
a Hanukkah gift).</p>
<p>Boxing Day was officially my day off: the house was clean,
the fridge was full of leftovers, and everyone was amused with
their new toys and books and activity books.  I had nothing
to do!  So I read my Christmas book (that collection of short
stories) in the morning and in the afternoon Tanya and her
brood came over and we ate more and compared schwag.</p>
<p>The next day we had Cordelia's friend Henry over for a
playdate and lunch.  Henry was a little sick and had a
minor meltdown and he and his Mom had to leave without
really enjoying their lunch, but the kids did get to play
a little bit.   Morgan came over for lunch too, and we
gave her her birthday present.  Later we had more latkes
with Kat and Baba and Zaida.  After the kids went to bed
Kat and Blake and I watched <em>Juno</em>, and I made Kat cry.
Christmas is hard.</p>
<p>Sunday no-one came over and we didn't do anything.  Delphine
was happy; I told her on Saturday the Baba and Zaida were
coming over and she said "I don't want any more company!"  She 
has very specific needs, that one.</p>
<p>Monday my friend Ellen and her million children (actually
three but two of them are louder or more rambunctious than
average) came over.  I love Ellen.  We always have fun when
she and her kids come over, but after this visit we decided that we
should try and get Dexter and Delphine together sometime
without younger siblings so they can play properly.</p>
<p>Tuesday we all went out together up Mount Pleasant to the
drugstore and the library and the toystore.  Delphine spent
her Christmas money, all five dollars of it, on a pocket
sized one of those little magnetic drawing pads.  She said
"it's just like Daddy's little computer!"</p>
<p>Wednesday, New Year's Eve, we all slept in until 8.  Normally
that would be great, but I had hoped to head down to the AGO
early.  I always like to get places early because usually 
they're less busy, and so that we can get home in plenty of time
for Cordelia's nap.  In reality we didn't get downtown until
11:00.  However, an hour at the art gallery is really all 
Cordelia's good for.  Delphine is at an awesome age for the
art gallery - she is becoming interested in how to draw
things "well", and we can talk about what colours the artist
uses, whether pictures are pretty or not, whether we like
them or not.  With Cordelia it's more, "Don't touch
that, Cordelia.  Please don't run, Cordelia.  Could you
be more quiet, Cordelia?"  We went for lunch at the food
court I used to go to when I worked downtown, and I had
a number 4 at New Thai Food: cashew chicken with sticky rice and papaya
salad.</p>
<p>Blake and I stayed up late on New Year's Eve, but it 
was pretty lame.  We ended up watching George Strombouloupoulos's
interview with Sarah Palin because there was so nothing on,
and that's ten minutes of my life I'd love to have
back.  </p>
<p>New Year's Day Delphine had a friend over, and the
next day we went skating!  I hadn't been skating since I
was a kid, and Delphine and Cordelia have never skated before.  Before
we went skating we went to the local skate shop and spent
$200 on skates, mainly for me.  I got some of these
new comfort skates.  <em>Comfort</em> skates!  They're purple!  Skating 
was very much
fun; I was surprised by how quickly I picked it back up
again.  I wasn't up to speed by any means, but I figured out
how to go forwards, how to go backwards, and how to stop.  Delphine 
got pretty good too, in an hour or so.  She isn't
quite skating properly but she can keep her balance.  Even
Cordelia did quite well, although when you're that short
and enshrouded in a snowsuit it's hardly catastrophic when
you fall over.  Kind of fun, actually.</p>
<p>That brings us to yesterday and today, which was a fairly
regular weekend.  I had taken the tree and decorations down
on Thursday and Friday, so the house is all back to normal
and tomorrow is just an ordinary Monday: Cordelia is back to
school, Delphine is back to school, I expect Blake will dig
back into work again and I will be back to my usual, busy,
slightly lonely and boring life.  Hmph, there's got to be
something to look forward to.  There's choir.  I have
a book club meeting on Friday.  Music class starts on
Saturday.  At some point in the future it will get warm again.
I guess it's not so bad.  I think I just have the Sunday 
blues.</p>
<p>But it was an awesome holiday!  I love Christmas.</p>

<p>Here is the last pile of books I read in 2008.  Since
it's now 2009 I can be reasonably sure I won't add
anything to this list.</p>
<h4>Non-Fiction</h4>
<p><strong><em>Restoration Home</em></strong> <strong>by Mark Bailey, Sally Bailey, and Debi Treloar</strong>
is an interesting decor porn book with a salvage bent.  These
people take shabby chic way beyond rumpled slipcovers and
distressed coffee tables.  They like chipped paint and missing
patches of plaster.  I liked the ideas about using industrial
light fixtures and other fittings, and about reusing found
objects.  I also like the aesthetic of not having everything
perfect and flawless.  Some of the examples in this book go
a little too far for my taste, though, into that crack-house
look.  To each their own.</p>
<p><strong><em>(parts of) Character is Destiny</em></strong> <strong>by John McCain and Mark Selter</strong>
This is a collection, written for a young adult audience, of short 
biographies of various historical figures
chosen by the authors to exemplify various character traits and
support their theory that "character is everything".  I 
picked it up partly because I had (previously) quite liked
and respected John McCain, and because there's a chapter on 
Roméo Dallaire, who I love.  I also ended up reading the 
chapters on Elizabeth I, Winston Churchill, Sojourner Truth,
and a couple others I forget now.  I learned a lot about
the people, which was the main point.  </p>
<p>This book made me wonder what
happened to John McCain that made him stray so far, during
the 2008 campaign, from the decent person he used to be.
I'm sure he's still decent, but something made him act all
crazy.  This probably ties into the fact that character is
indeed not everything and that how people behave is actually 
very strongly affected by the situation they are in (see
<em>The Lucifer Effect</em>.)</p>
<h4>Non-fiction books that are pretty good but that I don't have a lot to say about</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><em>Why Women Should Rule the World</em></strong> <strong>by DeeDee Myers</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>David Suzuki's</strong> <strong><em>Green Guide</em></strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Traffic</em></strong> <strong>by Tom Vanderbilt</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Mindfulness</em></strong> <strong>by Ellen Langer</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fiction</h4>
<p><strong><em>The Road</em></strong> <strong>by Cormac McCarthy</strong> was one of the best fiction
books I read this year, but in the same gruelling "I just want
this to end" way as <em>A Thousand Splendid Suns</em>.  I don't know 
what the connection is between gruelling and really good, but
if I ever come up with a happy and uplifting book which is
really good I will be sure to post about it.  This book hit a
few of my hot buttons: post-apocalyptic, small child, Viggo
Mortenson (okay, he's not in the book but I knew they cast
him for the movie version so that's what the protagonist
looked like in my head).</p>
<p><strong><em>Children of Men</em></strong> <strong>by P.D. James</strong> was really good.  I
didn't know P.D. James did speculative fiction.  This is 
another book I read instead of seeing the movie.</p>
<p><strong><em>What I Was</em></strong> <strong>by Meg Rosoff</strong> was a pretty decent young
adult book about a boy who is sent to a miserable boarding
school in Norwich (can there be any other kind?) and meets
a wild boy who lives on the beach.  They fall for each other
and hang out, there is some tragedy and a surprise ending.
Nice book.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Landing</em></strong> <strong>by John Ibbitson</strong> is yet another young
adult book, about a boy living in Muskoka in the twenties.  He 
plays violin but when you're poor in rural
Canada you're not going to get very far with that kind of
artsy nonsense.  Then he meets a woman who introduces him
to classical music and encourages him to pursue his playing.
Tragedy, rebirth, blah blah blah.  Actually a really good
book.</p>
<p><strong><em>Only You Can Save Mankind</em></strong> <strong>by Terry Pratchett</strong>; I mentioned
this earlier — I read it as a companion to <em>Ender's Game</em> and
like I said earlier, while I don't have as much meaty substance
as the other book it is funnier and equally well-written.</p>
<p><strong><em>Home for Christmas and other stories</em></strong> <strong>by Scott Young</strong> is
a collection of short stories, the old-fashioned kind with
a beginning, middle and end which don't
involve lots of weird allusions or great revelations or moments
of truth.  The kind of short stories that I and Michael Chabon
like.  They're all about Christmas, too.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Other Boleyn Girl</em></strong> <strong>by Phillipa Gregory</strong> is our
next book club book, and while it's not great literature it was
a good read, quite educational (assuming the historical
detail is accurate; I always wonder about that with historical
fiction) and will provide lots of things for us to talk about.</p>
<h4>Memoir</h4>
<p><strong><em>Schuyler's Monster</em></strong> <strong>by Rob Rummel-Hudson</strong>.  Well, the
cover of the book says "Robert Rummel-Hudson" but I've been
reading Rob's journal since Schuyler was just a baby, and
he's always been Rob.  It was cool to read Schuyler's
story in book form, and I liked that Rob kept his smart-assy
voice in the book.  I've always enjoyed Rob's writing and I
find it very hard to be impartial about the book because
I already liked it before I even read it.  I'm looking forward
to reading something of Rob's that I haven't read before.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Alchemy of Loss</em></strong> <strong>by Abigail Carter</strong> is a memoir
by a woman who lost her husband in the 9/11 attacks.  It's about
her grieving process and how she dealt with taking care of 
her two little kids, her family and husband's family, and with
her loss being part of a much bigger loss.  I picked this book
up because I have a fear of losing Blake, sparked in fact by 9/11,
and I wanted to read about how someone else had grieved and then
gone on with her life.  This book is beautifully written, very
honest, and hopeful.</p>
<h4>Parenting and Child Development</h4>
<p><strong><em>The Unschooled Mind</em></strong> <strong>by Howard Gardner</strong> is about how
kids learn about the world, and how educators really need
to take into account children's existing models of the world
when teaching them new things.  Apparently often what happens
is that kids learn two models of the world, the "real"
one and the "school" one.  The "real" model is the model
they kluged together through their observations back when
they were little kids, and the "school" model is techncially
correct but because they were never shown (not told) the errors
of their real-world model they only learn the school model 
by rote and never understand it well enough to take it out
into the real world.  So teachers have to know how to delicately
dismantle children's models — or rather help the children do it —
in order to make room for the new, subtler models.  Very interesting,
although Gardner is pretty dry.  More anecdotes please!</p>
<p><strong><em>The Homework Myth</em></strong> <strong>by Alfie Kohn</strong>.  I love Alfie Kohn.  He's
just so convincing.  In this book he convinced me that most
homework is a useless waste of time, which I'm sure will go over
really well with my kids' teachers.  Whatever, I'm not going to
squander my kids' precious free time doing busywork.  If the teachers
can come up with valuable interesting homework we'll do it.</p>
<p>Of course Delphine will do her homework anyway because she will
be too scared of getting in trouble not to do it.  Maybe Cordelia
will come onboard with my homework rebellion, though.</p>
<p><strong><em>How to Talk so Kids Will Listen And Listen so Kids Will Talk</em></strong> <strong>by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlich</strong>.  Everyone has said everything there is to be
said about this book.  If you deal with kids and you haven't read it
yet you'd better get on it.</p>
<p><strong><em>What to Look For In A Classroom and other essays</em></strong> <strong>by Alfie Kohn</strong>.
More Kohn cleverness.  He's an interesting and intelligent man.  This book
covers diverse topics in education, from standardized testing to the
subtle racism of middle-class mothers.  (Don't get me started on that
one.)  Great book.</p>
