<p>I have a friend who says he would read my blog if I
posted the minutes of our family meetings.  Now, I don't
necessarily want this friend to read my blog because I'm 
scared that he'll figure out I'm not as smart as he thinks
I am, but it is kind of a neat idea.  The family meeting
minutes are on the fridge, along with all kinds
of other household ephemera: kids' artwork, of course, and
Delphine's weird written creations; the week's dinner menus
and resulting shopping list; back when we had a regular 
income, our budget was up there; invitations to upcoming
events (usually for Delphine)...  Basically all our dirty
laundry is aired on the fridge.</p>
<p>So here are some highlights:</p>
<hr>
<h5>This week's dinner menu:</h5>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>chicken jambalaya<br>
ham, mashed potatoes and peas<br>
oven-roast root vegetable fries &amp; grilled cheese sandwiches<br><a href="http://www.mymilkcalendar.ca/recipeSearch/showrecipe/recipeid/2117/fromsearch/false">fiesta chicken soup</a> with tofu instead of chicken<br><a href="http://www.mymilkcalendar.ca/recipeSearch/showRecipe/recipeId/2124">teriyaki beef on rice</a></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So far it's all been pretty tasty.  I ended up using ham for the
jambalaya because there wasn't as much leftover chicken as I
thought there would be from the weekend's roast.  Kat was here 
for the oven fries and grilled cheese and she loved it.  I
like feeding Kat, she's always happy with what I make.</p>
<hr>
<h5>Minutes For The Next Family Meeting</h5>
<ul>
<li>rules for video games</li>
<li>how to prevent fighting every evening</li>
<li>bedtime: Mum's responsibilities and girls' responsibilities</li>
<li>we need some rules about touching the computer<ul>
<li>let's set up an account for Delphine</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h5>New Rules</h5>
<ul>
<li>Underpants must be worn at all times (except in bed)</li>
<li>No TV during the week</li>
<li>No candy before lunch</li>
<li>No complaining about people or situations within the home.</li>
</ul>
<p>(The underpants rule has since been modified by my pedantic
children to include the bathroom as well as bed.  The TV
rule has since been changed to allow two shows during weekdays
and four shows a day on weekends.  The complaining rule came
about because certain people were expressing their concerns
by whining rather than constructive requests:  "I can't reach
the bread!" rather than "Can someone pass me the bread."  I
think it's a good rule for life, actually.)</p>
<hr>
<h5>Delphine's List of Foods For Each Month</h5>
<p>No, I don't know why each month needs a food.  No, I don't know
what it means: do you have to eat the food every day that month?
Once that month?  Can you eat the food any other month?  She just
demanded we devise this list.  Translations in parentheses.</p>
<p>J pie (January: pie)<br>
F horts (February: hearts of any description.  I so want to bring
home a package of chicken hearts.)<br>
M Fiddld (March: fiddleheads.  She was quite impressed when she
realised fiddleheads has three d's in it.)<br>
A tost (April: toast.  Complete with backwards "s")<br>
MAY cace (May: cake!  It's her birthday.)<br>
JUN schobaires (June: strawberries.  She goes crazy with the spelling
sometimes)<br>
JL pechs (July: peaches)<br>
O iescrem (August: ice cream)<br>
S Apples (September: apples!)<br>
N rodabaga (November: rutabaga)<br>
Oct Pamkns (October: pumpkins)<br>
D Pudine (December: pudding. "I don't even like Christmas pudding, Mama,
I just put that in for you."  Awww.)</p>

<p>So Blake keeps asking me (why he asks me I don't know,
maybe he thinks I need practice looking stuff up) why
mirrors reverse left and right, but not up and down.
Well, uuuh, I dunno, but I thought I would look it up
for him since he hasn't bothered to do so himself.
(It's called enabling.)</p>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath441.htm">this page</a>
which is notable not so much for its comprehensibility
(I actually couldn't figure out what the hell they
were talking about, not that I tried very hard) but
for its patient explanations of basic social rules.  "It's 
not nice to treat people like they're stupid
by deliberately misinterpreting their questions, 
even if it is lots of fun."</p>
<p>A better explanation is <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/mirrors.html">this socratic treatment</a>, if you're interested.</p>

<p>Since my last run on Tuesday the weather has taken
a turn for the snowier.  We got 15 or 20 cm of snow
yesterday.  Most people have shovelled, but today's
run was more adventuresome than usual as I tried to
figure out how to get over and through all the slush.</p>
<p>I did 3K in 2-and-1s.  There were a couple of times 
I was really glad to get that walking break, and one
time in a very snowy block I just ignored the
"start running" beep and took an extra few seconds
of walking, but otherwise it was a good run.  It
was -8Â°C,  but I was warm enough in my usual gear,
until I stopped to chat with a neighbour at the end.</p>
<p>Now I've gone and woken up Cordelia.  Hopefully she
will go back to sleep because I still want to have
my afternoon reading break, and I have to stretch, and
empty and load the dishwasher.  And do laundry.  God my 
life is lame sometimes.</p>

<p>The other day I was talking to the head librarian at the 
library, about the options for someone who wanted to be 
a librarian when she grew up.  I've been toying with 
taking a one-year library technician course at a local
college, but the website says something like, "With
this diploma you can find work at public libraries 
outside Toronto."  But not inside Toronto.  If I want
to work at the TPL I have to either get a Masters or
work my way up the ladder for decades.  Well heck.  If I go into library work,
do I want to work at a public library or do I want to
work for a law firm or a corporation?  I'd like to at
least keep the option of public library work open.  We 
talked about the Masters of Information Studies at U of T, which
would be great if I can get in, apart from being pretty
expensive.</p>
<p>So I went to the U of T website where I found this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Applicants who graduated five or more years ago but 
without achieving sufficiently high standing for admission 
to the School may be considered for admission if, since 
graduation, they have done significant, intellectual 
work and/or made a significant professional 
contribution which can be considered equivalent to a 
higher academic standing. This contribution and its 
impact on the profession must be detailed and 
documented (e.g., publications, research, professional 
advancement, development of new skills, responsibility, 
etc.) and presented as part of the application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven't actually checked to see whether my BMath 
marks are sufficiently high, but since they are best described 
as dismal I can only assume they won't be. I spent 
ten years in a field which I hated and so
I wasn't exactly a stellar employee, and then I stayed 
home to take care of my children, and last I checked 
they don't actually give out awards for that.  So 
maybe, just maybe they will let me into this program
with a lot of sweet talking, more likely I will have to
take a few undergrad courses (which would be fine) or
worst case, I would have to take a whole new undergrad
degree.  Which will take years and cost a billion dollars
which I don't really have because we're in debt and we
haven't saved a penny for the girls' educations.</p>
<p>If I could give a high school graduate one piece of advice,
it would be to take an undergrad program that is easy enough
for you to graduate with good marks in, because not having a four-year
degree with good marks closes off so many career options.
I wish I had known, I would have switched into English like 
I thought about doing in 1A.  That is my one Erica Strange-style
regret.  I should have listened to my gut and not
stayed in math to try and impress the boys.  You
have one opportunity to be shiny and if you blow it, it's over.</p>
<p>That's not true.  I could start afresh and get a whole
new undergrad degree, and I guarantee I would kick ass
because I would choose something I'm passionate about 
(not math).  But man... the years, the money.  Am I just
making excuses?  Should I bite the bullet?  You hear all
the time about people who go back to school when their
kids are little, and work jobs at the same time!  Why can't
I be awesome like that?  I'm always looking for the easy
way.  Maybe if I want to do this properly, to live this
life as fully as I should, I shouldn't look for the easy
way.  Maybe the easy way will lead to regrets.  Maybe the
easy way will lead to a life of mediocrity distinguished
only by the nagging sense that I could have done better.</p>
<p>Or maybe I will make myself and my family miserable by spending 
too much time and money on a degree that won't actually fix
my life.  Maybe I should just get some tech job that I hate
and spend the money renovating the house.  Or try and get
a good job without getting a bunch more education.</p>
<p>So whatever.  Do I even want to be a librarian?  I have no 
idea.  I really want to do something useful and meaningful,
which sounds so idiotically idealistic and adolescent, but
I'm not speaking as an adolescent, I'm speaking as a mature
adult who sees what is going on in the world and who can't
tolerate the idea of being away from hearth and family simply
to earn money and further the ends of some CEO.  If I'm
going to work, I want the work to be worth doing.</p>
<p>Anyway, the time has come when I have to make a decision. 
Cordelia is going to start kindergarten this year, and 
in 2011 she'll be in grade one.  I need to start thinking
about what I'm going to do so I can take some
evening courses, or think about how to make money in the
meantime.  Can I even justify any further education when
we're so in debt?  Or does it make more sense to get me
all educated up so I can earn more sooner?</p>
<p>I just don't know.  I'm a muddled, confused mess and all
these questions are ricocheting around my head all the time
making me frustrated and exhausted.  I hate not having 
a direction, and I
have never been as directionless as I am now.  The only
thing I'm sure of is that I need to think about what I
like to do and what I'm good at, and make an appointment
with a career counsellor to figure out what the hell I
am going to do when I grow up.  Because I'm really ready
to grow up now.</p>

<p><strong><em>Everyday Survival: Why Smart People Do Stupid Things</em></strong> <strong>by 
Laurence Gonzales</strong> is a book about life.
It's a book about the origins of life, about how (and why) life
on earth developed, about how humans got to where we are today
and our purpose in the world, about mindfulness and mental
models and behavioural scripts.  </p>
<p>As such is it one of the most woefully misbilled books I have 
ever read.  I figured I was in for a discussion about how
humans' evolutionary history causes us to make mistakes in
the modern world.  And yea, that is what I got.  In the first
six chapters.  The next ten follow Gonzales in his search for
the origins of life, for answers about why we are here.  Along
the way I learned about energy and entropy, about fractals and
self-organizing systems, organic chemistry, vortices, tornadoes, 
the fact that life thrives in every nook on earth, even in the cores
of nuclear reactors, about giant caves, Murray Gell-mann's theory of
life ("The earth is rotting, and life is the waste."), and 
about why humans have such expressive faces.  And a hundred
other things, all of which Gonzales manages to pull together
in a sensible (if not necessarily linear) way to make his point.</p>
<p>Which point, by the way, is that climate change is the stupidest
thing of all, and that it is well within our capabilities to stop it,
if only we can manage to get out of the behavioural script,
the vacation state of mind, that we are living in now, the
script which says everything has been going fine until now,
so I will keep doing what I have been doing.  Gonzales doesn't
beat the climate change drum very often, but it's a theme that
reoccurs at key points throughout the book.</p>
<p>If I were to nominate a book to be an Atheist Bible, this might
be it.  Gonzales describes the origins of life (as far as we know
about them) and the origins of humankind, and explains why
life came about and what our place is in the universe.  He 
even takes a stab at explaining how we can fulfill our 
potential as human beings.  It is at times an intensely 
spiritual, moving book, whilst always being completely rational.</p>
<p>Lawrence Gonzales is a genius.  The way he digs deep and
deeper into a problem and synthesizes dozens of different 
areas of knowledge is breathtaking.  I had to read this book
with a notebook by my side to keep track of all the new
facts and ideas, and try and join them up like Gonzales did.
But he's such a good writer that it all goes down as effortlessly
as ice cream.    Anyone who is interested in thinking,
who likes a good idea, who loves a eureka moment, or who
wants to know what our place is in the universe should read
this book.  Everyone should read this book.</p>

<p>Kat has inspired me to get my running shoes back on; she is
training for an as-yet-unspecified 5K, so we're going to 
egg each other on.  She runs on the treadmill at her condo
and I like to run outside (because I don't have a treadmill
and I'm too poor to join a gym, and because running on
a treadmill is boring) so we probably won't actually 
run together until spring.  But we'll talk about running!</p>
<p>We talked about running last night before choir, and as Kat
wisely pointed out, if you want to do something you should
do it as soon as possible after you've determined to do it,
so I ran this afternoon after I dropped Delphine off at
school.  Since Blake is "working" from "home", he can 
make sure Cordelia doesn't catch fire or something 
while she's napping, and so I can leave the house in the 
afternoon.  Plus it was sunny and warm (only -5!) - too
good to pass up.</p>
<p>I did 3K in 1-and-1s.  1-and-1s is pretty lame, but I
haven't been out for a long time, and it's cold and 
when I run in the cold my lungs get wheezy and I get 
that coppery taste in my mouth, so
I thought I would go easy on myself.  And it was a
pretty easy run.  There were times
when the one minute of running seemed too short, and
only one time when I was really glad of the break, so
next time I will do 2-and-1s.  </p>
<p>My plan is to run three times a week, on Tuesdays,
Thursdays and the weekend.  I'll do 3K for the next two
runs and then up the distance a little bit and also
increase intensity to 3-and-1s.  I just hope it doesn't
stay so cold for weeks and weeks.  I don't know if I
can motivate myself to run when it's horribly cold.</p>
<p>I went for a couple of runs over the winter, before
it got so cold.  I tried something new: listening to
music instead of timing my intervals.  (I have to
choose because I time intervals by the beeping of
my watch and if I'm listening to music I can't hear
the beeps.  I'm sure there is some technological 
solution to this problem.)  Listening to music is
fun, but I missed the satisfaction of being able 
to measure and manage the ratio of running to walking.
(I'm a geek.)  Plus it's kind of nice to have time
to just let the thoughts roll through my head.  Apparently
that kind of unstructured daydreaming time is <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026811.500-the-secret-life-of-the-brain.html">very
important</a>.  So I'm going to stick with timing
intervals.</p>
<p>And now I should go stretch.</p>

<p>Our house is pretty chilly in winter, and it's quite clear
that one of the weak links is the windows.  You can tell 
from the avalanche of freezing cold air that rolls off the
windows as soon as you open the blinds*.  So this winter
we decided to try that plastic wrap stuff that you tape
around the windows and then blowdry to tighten it up and 
make it all smooth.  It's kind of ghetto but we can't afford
to replace the windows, so it will have to do, and I was
determined to do it right -- there is a house nearby 
with plastic on the windows and they didn't prep it properly
so the tape has come off and it's hanging down and it 
looks <em>really</em> ghetto.</p>
<p>There were two brands at the store, 3M and another brand
from Quebec.  This whole post would be much more useful if
I remembered what the brand of the other stuff was; anyway,
it comes in a blue box and it's from Quebec.  We bought
the two-window kit by 3M and the five-window kit from the 
other company; both kits were about $35, so you can see that
the 3M stuff would have to be much better to be worth the
extra money.</p>
<p>Here were the differences between the two products:</p>
<ul>
<li>the 3M stuff had slightly wider double-sided tape, and 
the tape backing had red text printed on it - that doesn't seem
like a big thing but our window frames are white so the white-only
backing on the other tape made it a little harder to find the
end of the tape.  3M advertise that "the difference is in the 
tape", and indeed that's one of the things they are known for,
but apart from the slight difference in width and the backing,
I couldn't perceive a difference in the tape.  Maybe the
other brand will start peeling off in February or something.</li>
<li>the instructions on the other stuff were more thorough.  At
first Blake interpreted that to mean that the other stuff was
harder to install, but installation was identical for the
two products, it's just that 3M tried to make it sound easy.</li>
<li>the non-3M film was thinner.  I suppose that would make it
more fragile but I didn't have trouble with it breaking, and
it heat-shrunk better.  I doubt the width of the film makes
much difference to insulation; I expect insulation is mainly
furnished by the air between the window and the film.</li>
</ul>
<p>So this is what you do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clean the window frame.  I used a solution of water, dish soap
and vinegar, and a cloth diaper.  (I cleaned the window too
because I'm not going to get at it for a few months.)
Then I wiped it with rubbing alcohol - that's what the
non-3M stuff said to do.</li>
<li>Put the tape on the window frame.  After the first couple
of pieces I figured out that you need to peel a couple of
inches off the backing paper before you put the tape up because
it's really hard to start it when it's up on your window.</li>
<li>Cut the plastic film to size.  We ended up with lots of 
extra film, but I'm not sure how much extra they give you.
Our windows might just be small.  Anyway, give yourself three
or four extra inches on each side just to be safe.</li>
<li>Peel the backing paper off the tape.  This is kind of fun.</li>
<li>Adhere the film to the tape.  You can actually stick it on 
fairly gently to start with, and then pull it off, stretch
it and restick it until you have it as tight and smooth
as possible.  Then press it firmly onto the tape once you're
happy with it.</li>
<li>This is the fun part: use a blow dryer to heat the plastic
so it shrinks like a giant shrinkydink and pulls all the
remaining wrinkles out.</li>
<li>Trim the excess film.  Carefully.  I was very conservative
and left lots of extra because I didn't want to risk puncturing
the film.  Your mileage may vary.</li>
<li>Stand back and admire your work.  I'm really happy with how
ours turned out; you can't see it at all from outside, and it's
barely noticable from inside.</li>
</ol>
<p>It took me about half an hour for each window, and I did it over
a week or so.  Kind of a big production and pain in the ass.
I think it's helping with the cold thing though.  Our big problem
(apart from the aforementioned avalanche of cold) was condensation,
and there's much less of it now, so clearly that cold is being
stopped.  I'm not sure if it's going to save us $70 in utility  bills, 
though.  But we'll probably do it again next year just for
the increased comfort.</p>
<p>Anyway, so that's what I learned about insulating window film.
Hopefully this is helpful to someone somewhere.</p>
<p>* Incidentally our blinds are awesome.  We have honeycomb blinds
from Hunter Douglas and they block a heck of a lot of cold.  We
saved a bunch on natural gas after we installed them, which is
good because they were about a million dollars.  I expect another
brand of the same product would be equally effective, but
the Hunter Douglas ones are very well made.  I'm happy with them.
(I wish we had got the top-down/bottom-up mechanism on all the
blinds, though; the only window we didn't get it for was the
living room, and sometimes I would like to open just the top
of that, like in the morning in summer when I'm not dressed yet.)</p>

<p>I mentioned briefly in my last post that Blake and I have
started watching a show called <em>Being Erica</em>.  It's about
a 32-year-old Toronto woman who gets a chance to travel
back in time and revisit some bad decisions from her past.
We're really enjoying it;  the characterization is
good, the scripts are funny, the music is AWESOME, and 
of course it's perfectly our age group so everything is
sometimes painfully close to home.  And it's SO Toronto
and so Canadian: lots of location shots, Molson Canadian,
sex in a canoe.</p>
<p>So Blake said, "I should totally tell Morgan to watch this,
with the graduating in '94 and the trips to Muskoka."  And
I said, "Yeah, I want to tell Kat about it, too."  Kat and
Morgan and I are all '75ers, and I think Kat would really
enjoy this show and relate, too.</p>
<p>And finally I wonder if my New York friends Sascha and Leontine
would like it -- they love Canada and Toronto so maybe
they'd get a kick out of it, if they have time to watch
TV.</p>
<p>Anyway (I think) all those people read this blog, so 
consider yourselves notified.  (Kat, we have them downloaded
if you want to watch them here.)</p>

<h4>Part III: Me</h4>
<p>Seems like even though this is my blog (well, half mine)
I don't post about myself very much.  I post about the kids,
I post about what I read, I even post about my husband
sometimes, but I don't post about what's going on with
me.  Lucky for you, but today your luck has run out: this
post is all about me.</p>
<p>It's still January, and January is still kicking my ass.
I've been so tired and so disinclined to do anything since
the Christmas decorations came down.  I haven't vacuumed, I
haven't tidied; I am just barely getting through the absolute
necessities.  I read awhile ago that when you get depressed
there's actually some kind of blockage in the system which
takes messages from your brain to your muscles, so you lie
there thinking, "I'm going to get up and pick up all that
Lego" and... nothing happens.  That's how I feel.  Plus,
as discussed earlier, it's so bloody cold.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a little breakdown because there's crap
all over the downstairs: dolls, stuffed animals, books, 
random miniature backpacks, board games, the usual
detritus of small children.  Since I have been more 
disinclined than usual to tidy up, this stuff has been
accumulating in the corners and nooks like giant, 
brightly coloured dust bunnies, and it finally tipped me
over the edge yesterday.  Blake's solution was: "Get the
girls to tidy up."  Bwah hah hah, yes, I'll get right
on that.  I'm sure that will be much easier than doing
it myself.  Then he got mad at me for being sarcastic.
So we had a big fight.  Le sigh.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Cordelia is still
too small to really understand how to tidy up, so if I 
want to continue to allow her to <em>own</em> and <em>play with</em> stuff,
I need to pick up after her.  Normally I'm okay with
doing that, but see above re: January.  Not only do
I lack the energy to clean up but I'm more emotionally
fragile than usual so the mess bugs me more.  Double-whammy,
POW, BIFF!</p>
<p>Whatever.  Out of the dust a phoenix rises, or at least a
good idea: we're going to get each girl a giant bucket
(I like <a href="http://www.tubtrugs.com/tubtrugs.html">these</a>)
and every day before dinner everyone has to load their 
shit, er I mean their prized possessions into their bucket
and take it upstairs.  Once there, Delphine can do whatever she
wants with her stuff and I will help Cordelia put hers
away in her room.  Result!  Hopefully.</p>
<p>Anyway, so that was my large digression regarding the
state of the house as it pertains to my state of mind, which
is not great right now but I'm sure will improve as the
days get longer and the snow melts.</p>
<p>Apart from the usual Mum stuff of cooking, cleaning, 
reading out loud, playing and taking people places, mainly
I spend my time reading and watching TV.  In addition to
the books I read, I also get through most of the Saturday
<em>Globe and Mail</em>, (excepting the Sports, Report on Business
and Travel sections which I recycle first off).  I also get
<em>New Scientist</em> every week (well, it's supposed to be weekly;
it seems to come in spurts), and <em>Today's Parent</em> every
month.  I used to get <em>Canadian House and Home</em> but I don't
have the money to decorate or renovate so it just depressed 
me.</p>
<p>We cancelled cable a while ago and now we download all our
TV, which is working really well.  I'm pretty happy with
the stuff we watch; life is short and there are lots of books
to read, so I try and only watch shows I really like.  I just
dumped <em>90210</em> because it wasn't good enough to squander precious
hours of my life on.  That doesn't seem to set a really high
bar, does it?  This is what I do watch: <em>The Daily Show</em>, 
<em>Chuck</em>, <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, <em>Dirty Jobs</em>, <em>Mythbusters</em>
(mainly because Blake watches it), <em>Doctor Who</em>, and 
<em>Torchwood</em>.  We also just started watching a show called <em>Being
Erica</em> which looks like it's going to be pretty good.</p>
<p>Extra-curricular activities are limited by time and the
goodwill of the various people willing to look after my
children so I can leave the house.  I have choir practice
once a week from September to May.  Every month or two my
book club meets for dinner on Friday night in a restaurant.  (Ooh!
A restaurant!  Shiny!)
Every month I go to the school Parents Association so I can
stay in the loop with all the juicy school gossip.  That's
about it, I think.  Housebound much?</p>
<hr>
<p>So here's an interesting thing.  (Interesting if you're me.)
When I graduated from high school I was the most boring,
unmotivated, uninterested, extrinsically motivated person
imaginable.  I didn't know what I was interested in because
I wasn't interested in anything -- the only thing that
motivated me was pleasing other people, and other people
don't have the first clue what's right for me -- so off 
I went to university
and did Math for some very bad reasons, none of which had
anything to do with genuine interest.  But I forged through.
(And now that I think about it was pretty damn good to get
a degree in Math from a such a hard school when I wasn't
the slightest bit interested in it.)  Anyway, so I got the
degree and I worked in computers and every day was horrible
because I just didn't care.</p>
<p>The last five years, since I haven't been working and since
I have been reading, have been like an Independent Study.  I've 
been free to read whatever I want and explore my own
interests. If I don't want to read something, I don't have
to.  If I do want to, I can, and then if that book leads me
to one or two or three other books I can read them, too.  (Funny 
thing: in all that time I don't think I've read a
single book about math.)</p>
<p>So oddly enough, being a stay-at-home mom has been a
very rich time for me, intellectually.  I've exposed myself
to lots of ideas, lots of novels, lots and lots of facts.
And the more I read and the smarter I get, the more I know that
I must change careers and that I need to spend some time
and effort figuring out what's right for me.  Fortunately
I have read plenty of books about finding happiness and satisfaction
in life, so I can use them for guidance.  But more on that
later.  That's a whole 'nother set of posts and I
still have lots and lots of thinking to do.  (For some reason
I have time to read but not time to think.)  Stay tuned.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now it's time for bed - tomorrow is Thursday, and it's going to
be warm so we might go play outside.  Apparently Delphine told
Blake she didn't want Mummy to be crabby any more, so he wants
me to figure out what I need to feel better.  I thought about it
a little bit and I think I need some time to myself, to get
away from everyone's needs.  I don't get a lot of that, and
usually I can deal but, well, January.  So I'm going
to take some Me Time tomorrow afternoon and go window shopping
on Bayview while Delphine is at school.  Delphine has French
after school, then home for supper and then I might
go downtown and see if I can get a good deal on 
a winter coat.  Dunno -- maybe I shouldn't blow all my Me time
on one day.  Or maybe I should!</p>
