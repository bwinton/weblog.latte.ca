<p>Well.  Didn't take long for that train to come off the tracks.
I haven't gone running since last time I posted, which was about a 
century ago.  First I got sick, then once I was better it was
all icy and cold, and then I just couldn't carve out a good

<p>We just came off a long weekend - Friday was a PA
Day (which means school is closed for those of you
who aren't from 'round here), and Monday was
"Family Day", a merciful and much-needed mid-winter
Ontario statutory holiday.  The weekend was full;
Friday the girls and I got together with friends.
Saturday we had <a href="http://www.musictogether.com/">music class</a>,
and then Delphine, Blake and I left Cordelia with Auntie
Morgan and Uncle Erik, and headed down to 
The Beaches for a birthday party for one of Delphine's
classmates.  While she was partying, we went to Dufflet
and enjoyed a tasty slice of cake while an orange and
white cat had a large and, I can only assume, satisfying 
poo in the garden outside the window.</p>
<p>It was great to hang out with Delphine by herself
for a while.  Both girls are really charming by 
themselves: Delphine
is thoughtful and interesting, Cordelia is intense
and funny.  Together they are often irritating,
to each other and thus to us.  So to take a nice long
transit ride with Delphine and get to hang out with
her and see the city was a real treat.  (How old do
you have to be before the view from the Bloor Street 
Viaduct stops blowing your mind?  Older than 
thirty-three, anyway.)</p>
<p>After the birthday party we came back uptown and
dropped Delphine off at Baba and Zaida's, with 
Cordelia, for a sleepover.  Then we went out to 
a movie!  We saw <em>Coraline</em>, in 3D.  (The movie was
great but the 3D was gratuitous.)</p>
<p>Sunday we slept in, then went in search of breakfast.
On the way home we picked up some groceries, and 
then relaxed for an hour or so before the girls came
home.  Later that day Kat came over, and the whole
family joined us for Sunday dinner.  After the girls
were in bed, Kat and Blake and I watched every 
<em>Being Erica</em> so far.  (Conclusion: good for now,
but Erica is going to have to stop saying stupid
things if she's going to keep our sympathies.  Moving
the plot along by making your protagonist repeatedly
screw up is lazy writing.)</p>
<p>Kat slept over, and the next morning we went skating
together.  In addition to her already-dizzying array
of talents and accomplishments, Kat is a Can-Skate
instructor and figure skater, so she taught
both Delphine and me some cool tricks.  I now have
muscle aches where I wasn't previously aware I had
muscles.</p>
<p>Kat headed home in the afternoon (after a long
and nearly fruitless search for an open grocery store),
and the weekend wound down quietly.</p>
<hr>
<p>Going out to see a movie was a nice treat, but the 
best part of our date was talking to
Blake before the movie, and on the way home, and 
the next morning when we went out for breakfast.
It was exactly like we were before the girls were
born, a relaxed, easy repartee.  We talked about all
kinds of things, we laughed at each other's jokes,
we worked on the cryptic and teased each other.
I was literally
shocked at how happy I was to be away from the children.
As I alluded to above, the girls have been a little
annoying lately and I guess it's been making me 
tenser than I realized.  </p>
<p>No, it's worse than that.  I felt <em>more like myself</em>
when I was away from the girls.  I felt like I was
the real me, the me who has a tidy
house and isn't mad all the time, the me who
talks to her husband about something other than
tomorrow's agenda and who is going to give up what
in order to take somebody somewhere.</p>
<p>I don't want to be one of
those mothers who is delighted to get away from
their kids!  I love my kids!  They are charming and
clever and fun.  I'm just overwhelmed by
them - five-and-a-half-years of almost non-stop
childcare is a lot. Maybe next year when Delphine 
is in school five hours a day, and Cordelia is in 
school half-days
I will have enough breathing space that I can properly
enjoy their company.  I want to like being with my kids, and
I want to feel normal when I'm with them, not
all stressed and crabby and resentful.  </p>
<p>But in the meantime, thank goodness for sleepovers.  No; 
thank Baba!</p>

<p>There was an article in yesterday's Globe about a
<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090206.wprof06/BNStory/National/home">University of Ottawa professor locked out of his office and banned from
campus</a>.  The article implies that he
was suspended from teaching because of his unorthodox
teaching methods: he doesn't like to give grades,
he altered course curriculum with student input.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was not his job, as he explained later, to rank their skills for future employers, or train them to be “information transfer machines,” regurgitating facts on demand. Released from the pressure to ace the test, they would become “scientists, not automatons,” he reasoned.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Which, frankly, to me, sounds freaking fantastic.  It's
exactly what <a href="http://www.alfiekohn.org/topics.htm">Alfie Kohn</a>
 recommends: student-led learning,
no evaluations.  </p>
<p>I'm pretty sure we're not getting the whole story,
though.  A quick Google shows that this guy is a
bit of a pain in the ass, so maybe the university has
other reasons to can him.  It would sure be nice if
they would step and say so, if they do.  In the meantime,
it seems like they're being idiots.</p>

<p>Cordelia and I are sick.  According to the
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/2006/0420/11-w-symptoms.jpg">Venn diagram of misery</a>
I have either a cold with muscle pain, fever and headache,
or a flu with sneezing and runny nose.  Maybe I have
a cold and flu simultaneously!  Whatever I have it's 
mild enough to allow me to get up and make myself
useful while still being severe enough to make me
miserable.</p>
<p>I kept Cordelia home from school today because she
woke up during the night all hot and coughing, but
now that she's awake she seems more or less fine.
I'm sure she will hit a brick wall sooner or later.
Hopefully I can get someone to pick Delphine up from
school so Cordelia can have a nice long nap.</p>
<p>Now I'm going to set the children up with the obligatory
Sick Day TV.</p>

<p>This morning while I was hanging up laundry in the basement,
I was thinking about stuff.  Mainly I was thinking about the
clever, interesting people at the party yesterday and trying
to figure out how I could spend more time with, or maybe work
with, clever, interesting people like that.  (Not that I didn't
work with clever, interesting people in software; in fact,
that's one of my favourite things about software.  Love me
some geeks.)  I was casting my mind about, musing on this
and that, on academia and science and research and clever
people doing interesting things, when it came to me:</p>
<p>I don't want to do science.</p>
<p>I don't know why that seemed like such a bombshell, but it seemed
very exciting at the time.  (It doesn't take much when
you're hanging cold wet t-shirts in a cold wet basement.)
I love science, I love facts,
I love knowing about the latest studies and ideas, but
I don't want to do the research myself.  I'm more interested
in getting things done (with the best new knowledge) than
in finding things out.  I love that other people are finding
things out but I just want to know what they've got.</p>
<p>So a career in dusty academia is not for me, which makes
this not much of an epiphany because I never thought it
was.  However, hanging out with Greg Wilson's clever friends
made me think that I would like to work close to
science, applying or disseminating the latest studies
and discoveries.  Blake's suggestion was science outreach,
and I also think science writing could be cool.  The other
idea that popped into my head was urban planning.  I feel 
like there must be some way to take scientific knowledge
and apply it to public policy, maybe try and get us out of
this mess we're in.</p>
<p>So many ideas.</p>

<p>This weekend Blake and the girls and I went to Greg Wilson's 
housewarming party.  Wow.  I have never in my life
been surrounded
by so many accomplished, interesting people.  Scientists, professors,
a guy who was writing a book, millions of PhDs.  The woman 
who owns Bakka books
was there, for Pete's sake.  Everyone was very clever and
cool and I, predictably enough, felt pretty boring and lame.
I think I aquitted myself fairly well, though, mainly by not saying 
very much.</p>
<p>It was a weird situation.  In a way I felt totally out of my
depth, completely outclassed, but in another way I felt like
I could fit in pretty well.  For example, I read <em>New
Scientist</em> magazine.  I have never knowingly met anyone
else who reads <em>New Scientist</em>.  (Apparently my friend
Dmitri reads it too but it's never come up when I've talked to
him.)  At yesterday's party, three of the people in one
particular conversation all read it, not counting me.
But does that mean that I'm in their league or does it just
make me a wannabe?</p>
<p>I dunno.  On the one hand I think I'm pretty smart.  On the
other hand, I have nothing to show for it.  Maybe I'm like one of
those people on <em>American Idol</em> who swear they're great
singers because their friends all tell them so, and then
they open their mouths and it sounds like someone's violating
a corgi.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm not particularly good with other people's parties
at the best of times so I think I did pretty well yesterday.
I talked to several different people about different things,
and I didn't make too much of an ass of myself.  I even made
people laugh a couple of times.  The 
children behaved themselves and were gorgeous.  And I have
serious appliance envy for Sadie's induction cooktop.  Gas
is pretty and all but that shizznit is <em>fast</em>.</p>

<p>I did another 3K in 2-and-1s this morning.  It was two 
degrees above, so mild I had to unzip
my jacket to cool off, and sunny!  I don't know
what we have done to earn this nice day, and on a weekend
to boot.  (This is an anomaly, though, this
afternoon it's going back to ball-freezing cold.  But at
least it's not January any more!)</p>
<p>It was a pretty rough run; two minutes seemed really long
and difficult.  I had a long day yesterday, though, and went to
bed late and was awoken at 2 am to find a lost sippy cup.
All these things make for harder runs.</p>
<p>Next week I'm going to forge ahead with 3.25 K in 
3-and-1s and see how it goes.  I realized this morning
that I've already screwed myself with my schedule: I 
was planning to run on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons,
but then I forgot and offered to help in Delphine's classroom on
Tuesdays.  So maybe I'll run on Tuesday evenings.  That
way I'd get one afternoon run, one evening run and one
morning run a week, which would provide some welcome 
variety.</p>
<p>Also I'm not going to blog every single run.  It's just
not that interesting.  I'll try and check in every week,
to keep me honest.</p>

<p><strong><em>Peepo</em></strong> <strong>by Janet and Allen Ahlberg</strong> is my absolute very
favourite picture book ever.  It's a rhyming story about a
baby's day and all the things he sees.  He wakes in the 
morning and sees, from his crib, "his father sleeping in
the big brass bed, and his mother too, with a hairnet on
her head."  Later in the day "he sees a bonfire burning,
pigeons in the sky, his mother washing windows, a dog going
by".  (I'm doing these from memory so they might be a bit
off.  I'm tired.)  </p>
<p>The book is set in World War II England and the illustrations
are exquisite.  Janet Ahlberg researched them meticulously
and each picture is rich with period detail.  I took this
book with me last time we went to visit
my Mum, who was a child during the war.  Mum loved the 
book so much I bought her a copy of her own to pore over.  Repeated
readings are rewarded with new details, and the text is
so charming and evocative of everyday family life 
that it is no hardship to read it over and
over (and over and over).  I buy this book for every new 
baby I know.</p>
<p>Also by the Ahlbergs is <strong><em>Each Peach Pear Plum</em></strong>, a
simpler book for younger babies with two lines on each
page: "Each Peach Pear Plum / I spy Tom Thumb."  And then,
"Tom Thumb in the cupboard / I spy Mother Hubbard."   The
smallest listeners will enjoy the rhythms and rhymes
and pretty pictures, and older children can find Tom
Thumb, or finish the lines for you.  This book 
introduces lots of characters from nursery rhymes,
fairy tales and folk tales which children will be
delighted to encounter later: Bo-Peep, the Three
Bears, Baby Bunting, and others.</p>
<p>Apparently this book has fallen out of favour because
the Three Bears go hunting, and Baby Bear is prone to
tripping over and accidentally firing his gun.  I say
pish.</p>
<p><em>Each Peach Pear Plum</em> gets bundled with <em>Peepo</em> in 
my baby shower gift
bag (along with "Breastfeeding Made Simple" by 
Nancy Mohrbacher and Kathleen Kendall-Tackett).  There
goes the surprise if I ever come to your baby shower.</p>

<p>I looked on the internet for some kind of career counselling
or guidance and I came across <a href="http://www.careerjoy.com/">Career Joy</a>.
I got them to send me one of their FREE 15-Minute Career Test
which promises to help me identify my key strengths and find the
right career for me!  Well, I've taken the test and I still don't
know the right career for me.  I think that might take a bit more
work. But I did figure out a couple of interesting things.
Here are my results.</p>
<h4>Step 1 - Personal Inventory</h4>
<h5>1. Talents.  What am I good at?  What do others say I am good at?</h5>
<ul>
<li>reading</li>
<li>writing</li>
<li>organizing</li>
<li>baking/cooking</li>
<li>talking to people</li>
<li>making people feel comfortable</li>
<li>understanding what people know, explaining things to them<ul>
<li>explaining things verbally</li>
<li>explaining things in writing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>proof-reading</li>
<li>spelling</li>
<li>typing</li>
<li>looking things up / research</li>
<li>managing the household:<ul>
<li>finances</li>
<li>activities for four people</li>
<li>food - nutrition / purchasing / cooking</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>singing</li>
<li>dealing with children</li>
<li>understanding and using computer software</li>
<li>understanding concepts / smart ("I'm clever!")</li>
<li>visualizing / spatial / math</li>
</ul>
<p>(This is going to sound a bit weird, but if there's anyone reading
who can think of anything I'm good at that I've missed, or if you
think I'm not actually good at something that I listed, please
comment.  I'm supposed to know what others say I'm good at.)</p>
<h5>2. Passions.  What do you love?  What do you read about?  What do you get angry about?</h5>
<p>Love: </p>
<ul>
<li>family</li>
<li>science and ideas</li>
<li>facts / truth</li>
<li>music</li>
<li>children</li>
<li>books</li>
<li>food (Shut up, I do love food.  I would marry it if I could!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Angry about:</p>
<ul>
<li>climate change / sustainability *</li>
<li>justice: hunger, human rights, health care</li>
</ul>
<p>(I put a star by climate change because it's really, really
important and if I'm to be any use to the world it should probably
be my first priority.)</p>
<p>Read about:</p>
<ul>
<li>childhood development and parenting</li>
<li>memoirs/other people's lives</li>
<li>climate change</li>
<li>science</li>
<li>sociology -- how people and systems work</li>
<li>psychology / happiness</li>
</ul>
<h5>3. Values  - what do you value in other people?  What do you believe strongly in?</h5>
<ul>
<li>truth / honesty</li>
<li>conscientiousness -- doing what you say you will / ought to</li>
<li>fulfilling your responsibility as a person or citizen / being a grown-up</li>
<li>kindness and consideration for others / taking care of the earth</li>
<li>being good and moral</li>
</ul>
<h5>4. Lifestyle - what do you want from your lifestyle?</h5>
<ul>
<li>right-size house (3 br, 2 bath, 2 office areas, lr/dr, den, backyard, shed)</li>
<li>short / bikeable commute from midtown Toronto</li>
<li>time to be with family</li>
<li>time to read </li>
<li>you know what I would really love?  I would love a job where I could read the newspaper as part of my job!  That would be cool!</li>
<li>two children (I already have those but I'd like to keep them if it's all the same to you.)</li>
<li>no additional property</li>
<li>no car</li>
<li>occasional vacation</li>
</ul>
<h5>5. Ecosystem/Environment - what atmosphere/environment do you work best in?</h5>
<p>Environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>clean</li>
<li>organized</li>
<li>quiet</li>
<li>indoors</li>
<li>personalized (my pictures, etc. around)</li>
</ul>
<p>(I'm a real princess, eh?)</p>
<p>Atmosphere:</p>
<ul>
<li>friendly</li>
<li>cooperative, not competitive or political</li>
</ul>
<p>(And a delicate flower, too, apparently.)</p>
<h4>STEP 2: Measuring Your Career Joy</h4>
<p>This is the step where you measure your current or previous career
according to what you determined about yourself, on a scale of one
to ten.</p>
<p>How well did software technical support utilize my best and most important talents?  <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p>How well did software technical support engage my 
passions?  <strong>2/10</strong></p>
<p>How well did software technical support meet my values?  <strong>4/10</strong></p>
<p>How well did software technical support meet my ideal 
lifestyle?  <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<p>How well did software technical support meet my 
ecosystem desires?  <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<p>TOTAL: <strong>31/50</strong></p>
<p>This is where it gets like one of those quizzes in <em>Seventeen</em>, 
because they tell you what your score out of fifty means.  My score
gets "Needs improvement. What is your lowest score? What
action(s) do you need to take to make improvements?"  Which is a
little unhelpful - aren't you supposed to tell me that?
Well, clearly my lowest score was in the area of Passions, which
I knew, but what is interesting to me is that the software career scored so
high in Lifestyle and Environment, which is probably why I stuck
with it so long.</p>
<p>Well, it was enlightening to think all this stuff through and 
write it down, but I am going to need more help to
sift through this information and decide which direction to go
in.  Onward.</p>
