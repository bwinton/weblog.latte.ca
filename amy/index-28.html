    <div>
<p>This is our third summer in this house and I'm finally starting
to get some inkling of an idea of what to do with the garden.</p>
<p><img src="../images/amy/backyard.jpg" align="right"></p>
<p>Today we dug up some of that unreasonable raspberry patch
and replaced it with a blueberry plant that Blake bought on impulse
this weekend. we should probably mulch it, but we don't have
any mulch. I also moved a few of the ostrich ferns which had
been stranded between the fence and the deck when we built the
deck. They were on either side of the pathway you see on
the bottom right there, and they were in danger of being trampled.
So I dug a nice new bed on the opposite side of the garden,
by the fence about halfway back, and moved five of the ferns 
over there. I'm 
going to get some huechera to go in between and it should be
quite charming. I love ostrich ferns—I told Blake I would
be happy if our garden was, like, forty percent ferns. They even
smell good.</p>
<p>We spent a lot of time cleaning out the hedge in the front yard.
I don't really want that hedge but I haven't come up with anything
better to do there so we're keeping it for now, but it's a mess.
Lots of different things growing in it, to the extent that
I had to arbitrarily decided which species was the "real"
hedge and then yank out anything that wasn't that, including
a truly irritating number of maple treelets.  I'm not sure
what the hedge is made up of, but I've noticed a few hedges
of it in the neighbourhood so it must be something pretty
standard. While I was checking out other people's 
hedges I noticed more than
a few which were lousy with maple. One was mainly maple. </p>
<p>The last big accomplishment today was moving the composter from
the neighbour's yard to ours. They are shiny urban hipsters
and composting isn't really their thing—the composter was left
by the previous owner—so they said we could have it. We
tucked it just behind the new fern bed, not too far from the
house that we won't use it, but not too close either. It's
not terribly ugly and I think once the ferns grow up more 
it will be mostly concealed.</p>
<p>Incidentally, having our own compost will yet further complicate
throwing stuff out, because now we'll have two categories of
compost: backyard compost (fruit and veg scraps, tea and coffee,
and yard waste) and city compost (leftovers, meat, kleenex, all that
gross stuff). So we'll need two containers on the kitchen counter.
There's gotta be a good way to do that but I haven't figured it
out yet.</p>
<h5>The Plan</h5>
<p>Okay, "plan" is a little grandiose for something that's not much
more than a collection of notions. First, as you can see I've
covered a fair bit of ground with that giant playstructure.
For now I'm happy to have that area be weeds and dirt, and it's
happy to oblige. So that's a good 320 square foot I don't have to
worry about. (Well, I planted some scarlet runner beans to grow up it
just for fun.)</p>
<p>I want to create a path between the back gate and garage, and the
front gate (which is where the path by the deck leads).  Ideally 
that would be some kind of cool flagstone path, either with rectangular
flagstones or crazy paving, but for now we'll have to settle for
the leftover Unilock from those same neighbours' previous front
path. It would also make sense to pave the area around the laundry
dryer since I stand around there a lot and lawn doesn't stand a
chance. Plus that way if I drop something it won't get all muddy.</p>
<p>We've got the vegetable garden going by the deck there, and I
expect it will stay there because that's one of the sunniest parts
of the yard, unless we give up on it altogether and just grow
food in the planters on the deck.</p>
<p>For the rest of the garden, I'm going for a low-maintenance,
woodland, bird- and butterfly-friendly mainly-native plant
vibe. The only specific plants I have in mind at the
moment are a Saskatoon berry plant for the birds, and something
evergreen for winter interest, of which I have none at the
moment. I'm finding it really hard to source native plants
but I suspect I just don't know where to look.  I need to 
keep researching them so that I have the names of native
plants in my head, so I recognise them when I see them. Most
garden centres and catalogues don't have any comment on whether
plants are native or not.</p>
<p>That's the plan. It's going to take a while to get there, but
at least I have some idea where I'm going so I'm no longer
paralysed by my garden. Onward!</p>

<p>I was given <strong><em>Love Monkey</em></strong> <strong>by Kyle Smith</strong> by 
<a href="http://inquisiturient.blogspot.com/2009/03/march-2009-books-and-movies.html">a friend</a> who hated it. Not sure what this says about my
friends, but I definitely didn't hate this book. It's
your typical 30-something single New Yorker looking for
love book, except the protagonist is a guy instead of
a chick. </p>
<p>Smith sets up his protagonist, Tom Farrell, as 
a dick—he's rude to his mother and he's a cartoon-watching,
cereal-for-dinner-eating 
man-boy—and then redeems him over the course of the book
with self-deprecating honesty and vulnerability,
and with the charming, witty conversations he has with his 
romantic interests, the almost-perfect Julia and the
reliable back-up date Bran.</p>
<p>I found it interesting to get into this
particular man's head. At first I was quite put off by
how self-conscious Farrell is and how he overanalyses
and manipulates situations to suit himself, but then
I realized that I do that too—we all do.
For example, I had some people over
yesterday, some of my coolest and brightest friends.
We all brought some books that we had enjoyed and
wanted to pass on, and did a big old book swap. One
of the women brought <em>She's Come Undone</em> by Wally
Lamb, and she reported that when she chose it her
husband questioned her choice: "Think of your
brand!" he said. We all made fun of that but I 
think we all know what he meant—you have this
image of yourself that you want to project to other
people, and it
isn't necessarily your whole, honest nitty-gritty
self. You second-guess your impulses, you
debate clothing choices, you carefully curate the 
items in your home. I will admit that the books
on display in my dining room are slightly cooler
and smarter (and prettier) than the books hidden 
upstairs.  Smith unflinchingly documents Farrell's 
management of his brand, which could make him seem 
like a manipulative phony, but his vulnerability and
honesty and wit won me over in the end.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Going Solo</em></strong> <strong>by Roald Dahl</strong> is the sequel to
Dahl's childhood memoir, <em>Boy</em>. <em>Going Solo</em> documents
Dahl's early twenties working for Shell in Tanzania, and in
the Royal Air Force fighting in Greece during
the German invasion. He talks about the people he met
in Africa, the bizarre adventures he had there, his
training as a pilot followed immediately by a
spectacular crash which sent him to hospital for
six months with a horrible head injury. Once he
recovered he was sent right back into the fray,
where he faced ridiculous odds against the German
invasion and was one of the last of the Allied forces
to flee Greece.</p>
<p>The only
slow spot in the book was when Dahl detailed apparently
every training flight he took. (I expect flying
the planes was more interesting than reading about
it.) The rest of the book was exciting and moving.
The best part was when Dahl encountered a
group of Jewish children and the man who was 
protecting them, hiding them in an obscure corner
of Greece. Like so many people, Dahl was oblivious
to the Holocaust and his bafflement about
the Jews' plight was curiously charming. </p>
<p>The disastrous loss of almost all the men he flew with was 
a reminder of the idiotic nature of war. 
I am both thankful that Dahl made
it through the war alive, and sickened by the thought
of the amazing talents that we will never know about
because they didn't.</p>
<p>I enjoyed <em>Going Solo</em> and would recommend it particularly
to boys, although I don't know what age. (I picked it up
at the school library, so obviously someone thinks that kids
twelve or under would like it.) It's exciting
and captures what it was to be a gentleman and adventurer
in an earlier, but still fairly recent, time.</p>
<p>We read <strong><em>The Pillars of the Earth</em></strong> <strong> by Ken Follett</strong> in
Book Club. I gave it a 5, which is the second-lowest
rating I have given a book club book. My first exposure
to this book was back when it came out in '89; it was
panned horribly by a <em>Globe and Mail</em> reviewer and one
of the English teachers at my high school used the review
as an example of how to review a book negatively. I don't
recall if I read that review, but ever since high school
I've carried with me the idea that this is not a particularly
good book, and reading it didn't turn that impression around.</p>
<p>My two main problems with the book are that the writing is
clunky and awful, and that it has no particular Literary
Value—it's not clever. I did quite like
the characters, and the plot was exciting if a little
relentless towards the end. The book was 
well-researched and Follett certainly made sure to put
in plenty of historical detail so all that time doing research
didn't go to waste. I enjoyed all the information about
building and architecture, and I appreciate
Follett's attempts to describe complicated structures
without illustrations. I wish he had put a little more
effort into period-appropriate language; the book is 
thick with anachronistic words and usages. For
example, when writing from the point-of-view of a 
female character he refers to menstruation as having
a period, a usage which didn't appear until the 1800s.
The book would have been richer and more engaging
if the language hadn't seemed so modern.  </p>
<p>In the end <em>The Pillars of the Earth</em> didn't engross me.
I read on because I wanted to know what happened, but I
wasn't invested in the characters or absorbed into the 
action.</p>
<p><strong><em>Get a Freelance Life: mediabistro.com's Insider Guide to Freelance 
Writing</em></strong> <strong>by Margit Feury Ragland</strong> Yes, you see where
I'm going. I kind of hate how listing the books I've
read provides a kind of window into what I'm thinking 
about, but there doesn't seem to be any real point in
being secretive. </p>
<p>This is the second book I've read on writing as
a job, so you might suppose that I'm contemplating a
new career direction. Well, maybe I am. If I were this
would be a very helpful book, perhaps even one to buy
and keep around. It has plenty of advice on how to
launch your writing career, how to focus on a speciality,
how to do research, pitching ideas, the editing process
and all the many varieties of editor that can be found
in the wild, and much more besides. The book is aimed 
mainly at magazine and book writing, with only one chapter
about business writing.</p>
<p>I started reading <em>Make a REAL Living As A Freelance 
Writer: How to Win Top Writing Assignments</em> by Jenna Glatzer
but right at the beginning of the book she says something
about how you <em>could</em> make a living writing for businesses,
but would you rather tell your friends that your byline is
on an article in <em>People</em>, or that you wrote the piece of
junk mail they just tore up. Well, first off I'm not a
pathetic celebrity whore, and second not all business 
writing is junk mail. I don't even think I have any friends
who read <em>People</em>! (My problem with writing for magazines is
that I don't really read them: I read <em>Toronto Life</em>, 
<em>New Scientist</em>, <em>Today's Parent</em> and <em>Chirp</em>. I'd be 
happy to write for any of those publications, but a potential
market of four magazines is
hardly going to put bread on the table.)</p>
<p>Between that, the ALL-CAPS EMPHASIS in the title, and 
some snotty comment about how it's so unprofessional 
to have children crying in the background
when you're on a business call (because God forbid you
should want to <em>earn a living</em> after having <em>reproduced</em>)
and I just gave up on this book. If I ever develop a 
burning desire to write in magazines for fame and fortune,
I will know where to look for advice.</p>
<p><strong><em>Your Five- and Six-Year-Old</em></strong> <strong>by the editors of Parents magazine</strong>.
Delphine has gone all weird and cranky lately, so I sought
out books about six-year-olds to see if it's a Thing, and
apparently it's a Thing. Six-year-olds are all neurotic
because they're trying to detach from their parents and become
independent but
at the same time they totally adore us, so that creates this
horrible inner conflict which causes them to be psychotic bitches
half the time and completely adorable, enthusiastic
sweethearts the rest of it. It's exhausting. It's
funny how before you have kids everyone tells you about
the Terrible Twos, but they don't mention the Fucking
Fours or the Psycho Sixes. Two was easy, dude. At least
Two doesn't tell you she hates you.</p>
<p>This was a helpful book, nice and pragmatic. Lots of stuff
about praise, which is kind of anti-Kohn, but then apparently
six-year-olds eat up praise and so much of parenting a
six-year-old is about easing them through this horrible
stage (they're not enjoying it any more than you are) so 
maybe a little judicious praise, or at least unbridled
adoration, would go a long way.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Fine Art of Copyediting</em></strong> <strong>by Elsie Myers Stainton</strong>
When I mentioned to <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/">Greg Wilson</a> that
I was pondering a writing career he suggested I consider 
editing as well, so I got a couple of copyediting books
out of the library. If you imagine that a book about copyediting
would be quite boring, you'd be right. I think this book
is probably as exciting as a copyediting book could be, and
it was still pretty dry. Stainton does a great job giving
an overview of the copyeditor's job, as well as providing
plenty of concrete reference material such as editor's marks
and grammatical rules. The best part, though, is her 
defense of the art of copyediting, of the importance of it
and the satisfaction of being part of the 
intellectual discourse. </p>
<p>I learned some things about 
editing which I didn't know: I didn't realize that editors
are responsible for identifying poor reasoning and flawed
arguments, nor did I realize that they are supposed to 
identify racist and sexist language. It's not just 
grammatical nitpicking! (It's other kinds of nitpicking too!)
That made me much more interested
in copyediting, although I'm not sure I am detail-oriented
enough to be a good copyeditor. It's worth
contemplating further.</p>

    <div>
<p>I've been thinking some more about Guides. There's a lot
more to it than I first thought.  The problems
I wrote about yesterday, with the badges and the structure,
those are problems of unmet potential. Guides
could be a fantastically cool opportunity for girls
to explore their interests and challenge themselves, but 
in fact it's a leader-centred crafts-and-activities club.
Some of the crafts and activities are cool, some of them
are pretty lame, but they're seldom actively damaging.
(Although I wish Delphine's troop hadn't chosen to
do a <em>bridal shower</em> for a leader in one of
the meetings.)</p>
<p>But failed potential is only that; it doesn't mean Sparks
has no value. It's an all-girl group of friends separate
from Delphine's school friends, which is important. It's
good for kids to have more than one group of friends; if
one group goes wrong with bitchiness or drama, you have
other friends to fall back on. And it's valuable
for kids of either gender to spend significant amounts
of time in same-sex groups.  On both those counts,
Sparks stacks up in a way that I don't think will be
easy to find elsewhere.</p>
<p>The other nice thing about Sparks/Brownies/Guides is
that it taps into the Guiding infrastructure. They
have programs, they have funding, they have summer
camps and campsites. (Sparks don't go camping, but Brownies
do.) Camping with Brownies and Guides was my first 
exposure to real camping, and it had a lasting impact
on me as it did on Kat.</p>
<p>Guides is also an organization with a rich history, 
and it's represented throughout the world. When I was a kid
I remember thinking it was pretty cool that there were
Girl Guides just like me in places like India and 
Australia.</p>
<p>I've tried, largely in vain, to find other clubs or 
organizations which would fit the bill: a (preferably)
girls-only organization which will provide community
and allow my girls to explore their interests and
challenge themselves in a supportive, pedagogically 
progressive environment.  In the States
they have Earth Scouts and Camp Fire Boys and Girls, which seem
to be much more sciency, and more child-centred, than
Guides. Camp Fire Boys and Girls is 
US only. The Earth Scouts website is pretty horrifying
and they do that stupid badge thing too. (Maybe my standards
are too high.) I've thought about seeing if the ROM
or the OSC have any kind of generic Science or
Discovery clubs, but they wouldn't provide that 
continuity of community that I'm hoping for. I've
even thought about starting something up myself, but
I don't care about this enough to invest that kind
of time and effort into it. (Not that I don't care
very much, but it would be a <em>lot</em> of time and effort.)</p>
<p>In conclusion, Sparks seems to be the best of a bad
lot of options. Is that good enough? I'm still thinking
about it.</p>

<p>I'm trying to decide if we should keep Delphine in Sparks 
next year. (Sparks is the
precursor to Brownies, for 5- to 6-year-olds.) Delphine has
been in Sparks for the last year, and now the time has 
come to sign up for next year.  But I have serious qualms.  </p>
<p>Guides is supposed to be about empowering girls and
allowing them to build confidence, and yet they're going
about it all wrong. The organization decides what girls
should be interested in (by making badges available), 
decides how they should go about exploring those 
interests (the bullet-point items you have to fulfill
before getting a badge) and then rewards them for
their interest. Rewarding kids for things is a <em>proven
demotivator</em>. And worse, in Sparks the girls haven't
even had a chance to express their own interests: the
meetings are predetermined at the beginning of the
year. The girls' interests don't even come into play!
It's incredibly disappointing to see a great
opportunity to excite and engage girls be squandered
because the adults involved lack the knowledge or
imagination to do things differently.</p>
<p>Of course it's a giant crapshoot how good your troop is
going to be because the Guide organization doesn't provide
all that much, well, guidance on how to plan and run meetings.
You might get amazing leaders who do know how to motivate
and engage kids, or your girls might be stuck with a group
of unruly kids led by frustrated adults yelling at them to shut
up and get on with the Pointless Craft of the Day.</p>
<p>And if that weren't annoying enough, you have to sign an
idiotic release form every time the troop does anything
out of the ordinary. If the organization is that risk-averse,
how are they going to help my girls become fearless?</p>
<p>Finally it's expensive. The annual fee is $125, there's a $1 dues
  charge at every meeting, and twice a year we have to pay
  $96 for those lousy cookies (and then dispose of them as we see fit).
  Plus we had to buy a shirt and sash. I suppose compared to
the $250 or so that we spend on most 12-week programs Guides
isn't actually all the pricey, but they seem to keep leeching
at us all year instead of just once up front.</p>

she really enjoys

<p>Here is the how I throw thing out:</p>
<p>I recycle: plastic containers and glass (the plastic containers
with their lids on but not the glass containers), tin cans, styrofoam,
cardboard cans with their metal lids, plastic bags but only the 
ones from stores, and not the bags that milk bags come in which are
completely identical but for some reason unacceptable. That's okay,
I save them for cat litter. Also plastic
bags must be recycled in bunches, not one by one. Further I save
the bags without holes in them to contain regular garbage and
compost, which means that I have three separate streams into
which plastic bags can possibly go. Also recyclable are newspapers,
magazines, and regular paper but not paper that the girls have
glued random crap onto, nor stickers (too sticky, they gum up
the recycling works).</p>
<p>Speaking of compost, that's the City of Toronto compost which
accepts all the usual vegetable matter as well as any other food
(except gum), paper plates and napkins (but not paper cups from 
coffee shops), diapers, kleenex and paper towels, tea bags, cat 
litter and dog poo but not cotton balls, q-tips, or hair and 
fingernail clippings. (Because that would be gross.)</p>
<p>Outside, there's yard waste, which is weeds and leaves and
twigs and stuff but not grass clippings.</p>
<p>Then there's the stuff which isn't garbage yet, the clothes and
toys and furniture and housewares we don't need. Some of that
I'm saving for the school's fundraising garage sale, some of
it goes into the Goodwill bag for when Andy does a Goodwill run,
and some of the toys I'm saving for that mythical day when I sort
out all their pieces and find their manuals and take them to the 
consignment store.</p>
<p>Finally, as a last resort, there's regular garbage:
anything that doesn't
fit into the above categories, mainly rejected plastic bags and
other plastic packaging, and broken things.</p>
<p>I hate throwing things out because it's complicated.  It's 
hard to believe that fifty years ago people just threw
everything away in one container. How simple! Which
is exactly why it's dangerous — it can't be that easy
to get rid of things. You have to be mindful of whether your
trash still has value, as a source of energy
or materials, or to someone else in its current form. And
when I'm feeling sorry for myself because it's so hard to throw
something out I remind myself that I wouldn't have this
problem if I didn't bring that thing into my house in the first
place.</p>

<p>In the last few weeks I have had no fewer than four conversations
about the impending apocalypse. Not ironic conversations,
either.  (Well, one of them involved zombies, but the others were
in earnest.) One of my friends has a plan for what to do if 
America annexes Canada. Another is trying to work out how to
feed her family with what she can grow in her backyard.</p>
<p>We are all serious. We all believe that the world is
going to change drastically in the next twenty to fifty years,
and it's by no means clear that the changes will go smoothly.
We face climate change, a crisis in the food distribution networks,
a global pandemic, peak oil, economic collapse, and even (this one is new!)
loss of electrical service due to a 
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/djulc7">massive solar storm</a>.  There's
a palpable sense among my peer group that we're living in
a fantasy, that the life we live is too good to last.  We've 
built an edifice so high, so fragile and so glorious that
it is bound to come tumbling down.</p>
<p>Does anyone else feel this way? Is it just me and my weird 
friends? Admittedly we all tend to be overthinkers, we are
all a little fringey and cynical and mistrustful of 
common knowledge and received wisdom.  The mainstream media
seems oblivious: articles in the Globe only occasionally
mention climate change, apart from the articles <em>on</em>
climate change off in the "Science" ghetto.  There was
fear of a flu pandemic a few years ago, but after it died
down no-one mentioned the danger again until this latest
outbreak of swine flu, despite the fact that the risk
of a flu pandemic never actually changed. As for the
food thing, no-one seems to be acting on the fact that 
our food production and distribution system is a house of
cards, apart from a few urban foodies who are willing to
pay hundreds of dollars for a share in a nearby farm.
There doesn't seem to be a meaningful political response to
any of these threats, perhaps because the time-frame is
so vague, so unfittable into four-year terms.</p>
<p>Ever since the 9/11 / blackout / SARS conflagration of
debacles the Government has been encouraging us to have an <a href="http://www.getprepared.gc.ca/index_e.asp">emergency preparedness kit</a>
containing enough food, water, flashlights, blankets and 
medical supplies to last 72 hours. That's a good start, but
that's <em>so</em> not the scale of emergency I'm worrying about.
I'm talking weeks or months or years of upheaval followed by an
entirely new way of life.  </p>
<p>So what am I doing?  Well, 
mainly just worrying,
and speculating. What's gonna happen if... the power goes
out? How long before Toronto cuts down all its famous trees
for heat and cooking?  What if... Canada is deluged by climate
refugees? How many people will we have to share our 2700 square
foot of land with in order to live sustainably?  What if... 
there's a flu epidemic? Will the grocery store shelves be
empty? Should I buy more flour?</p>
<p>We've done all the major things we can
afford to do. We live centrally so we don't need a car. Just
by sheer luck we happen to live in the middle of one of the best
patches of arable land in Canada, so provided they don't 
build McMansions all over it we should be well-placed
for a mainly-local-food diet. We have a tiny house which is
cheap to heat and stays pretty cool in summer. We're trying 
to grow our own vegetables.  One day we'll get some solar 
panels so we aren't entirely dependent on the electrical grid.</p>
<p>But we're not that crazy!  We're not stockpiling food, or 
medicine, or seeds, or
guns.  We're not going off the grid. We're not building a
bunker. It's hard for me to discern what's too crazy. I was
wondering if it would be worth learning how to salt-cure meat,
in case the power goes off when we have a freezer full of
beef. But then I'd have to stockpile a lot of salt, and that
seems to be beyond the too-crazy mark. On the other hand I
do intend to find out how to purify water so we can drink
the water from the rain barrel if the taps dry out.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel stupid, worrying about this stuff. Other
people don't seem to.  What if everything turns out fine?
Won't I look silly then? But stupid doesn't begin to describe
how I'll feel if something does happen and I'm not prepared,
at least as prepared as I can be. In the meantime, life 
goes on; I shave my legs and get my hair cut and sing 
and take my children to school. I carry on. I bet you
can't even tell I'm crazy.</p>

<p>Something's not quite right in my life; I'm out of balance.
Fortunately — and I know this is rare — I know what's wrong
and I have a pretty good idea how to fix it.</p>
<p>A few months ago I got this laptop. It's a Toshiba Satellite
with a Celeron (celery!) processor and 192 MB of RAM. It's
running Windows XP and it's really, really slow. (I should
probably switch to Ubuntu.)  Nevertheless,
it's a laptop, and that means I can fart around on the Internet
while we watch TV, after the girls are in
bed. That's good because it adds an extra couple of hours
to my Internet day, giving me time to blog and Twitter. It's
bad because somehow the combination of TV and Internet makes
it very, very hard for me to get off my butt and go to bed
at a reasonable hour, leaving me cranky and exhausted the 
next day.  The other bad is that I don't write
particularly well when I'm watching TV, and I don't watch
TV particularly well when I'm writing.  The TV I watch 
tends to reward attentive viewing, and half-watching it is
worse than either watching it or not watching it at all.</p>
<p>Simple problem, simple fix: I'm going to stop using the
laptop in the evenings, and instead watch TV properly, or 
read if it's one of Blake's shows.  I'll go to bed at a 
decent hour, which will give me the energy to write in the 
afternoons. Currently my afternoons are spent either
napping (on the really bad days) or reading, with a little
light housekeeping if I absolutely have to. I'm not sure
whether writing in the afternoon will deal too much of a
blow to my reading time; I hope I will be able to get to
bed by ten and read until eleven, and maybe read in the
mornings sometimes too.</p>
<p>All this is temporary, of course: once Cordelia is in 
school everything will change again and I'll have to find
a new balance.</p>

<p><strong><em>Getting Started As A Freelance Writer</em></strong> <strong>by Robert Bly (2008)</strong>
is about... well, just guess what it's about. It  was on the "new"
cart at the library so I thought I would check it out. Maybe I
can be a freelance writer! Here's how!</p>
<p>Robert Bly has written about a million books, almost all of which
you undoubtedly haven't heard of, and he also writes magazine articles,
marketing material, annual reports, brochures, junk email... pretty
much anything you can make money at. He's not an "author" or a 
"novelist", he's a writer, and in this book he tells you how you
can make a living as a writer too.</p>
<p>Obviously it's hard for me to say whether his advice is any good since
I'm not a writer, nor have I ever read any other books on making
a living as a writer.  It seems pretty sensible - he offers practical
advice on how to set up your office, how to market yourself, how to manage
your writing business, how to find work - but then this guy makes
most of his living writing "direct mail marketing" copy, ie, snake
oil ads.  Bly also makes lots of money through self-published ebooks, 
booklets, giving speeches,
selling CDs of his speeches... basically regurgitating the same
content in as many ways as possible to get more money out of it.</p>
<p>The book also contains sections on gettings cartoons, personal
essays, and poems published.</p>
<p>Ironically, the book could have been better written, or perhaps
better edited. There were a couple of times where he introduced
the same concept twice within a page or two, as if he had rearranged
some paragraphs and then not checked it closely enough.  (This,
I suppose, supports his contention that you don't have to be
a <em>good</em> writer to make a living at it.) The section on the
Internet was terribly dated; "If you think, as some people do,
that there's any future in the Internet". (That's a paraphrase,
I forgot to write down the exact quote.) This edition was a rework
of the 1997 edition, and clearly he should have paid more attention
to the Internet section.</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether this book convinced me that you can make good
money writing, or whether it just showed that you can make money
doing just about anything if you are willing to work hard enough
at selling yourself, and repackaging your material in lots of different
ways. The more I think about it the more it seems what made Bob Bly
rich wasn't being a writer but being an entrepreneur, which is not
to say that you can't make money writing, but Bly's path to riches
isn't exactly the path I want to take.</p>
<p>One more thing - Bob Bly makes lots of money selling books about
how to be a copywriter, and on further investigation there's a
whole online cottage industry of ebooks, email newsletters, etc 
about writing. Doesn't that
seem like a pyramid scheme? Bly sells a book about writing to 2000
people, those people write and sell 2000 books each - what happens when
everyone who wants to be a writer has bought a book about it?
Doesn't someone, at some point, have to write about something
else?</p>
<hr>
<p>Thomas Foster mentioned the novels of Reginald Hill a few times
in <em>How to Read Novels Like A Professor</em>, so when I found
<strong><em>Pictures of Perfection</em></strong> in a plastic bag at someone's curb,
I picked it up. It says on the cover that it's a Dalziel/Pascoe
mystery, but Dalziel and Pascoe are fairly minor players; the
main investigator is a policeman (I can never remember people's
rank) named Wield who is sent off to an odd little village in
Yorkshire - odd not in the usual Yorkshire way - to discover the
whereabouts of the missing village bobby. On the way to locating
the missing policeman, Wield meets various peculiar village
characters and has to sort out their relationships, their
history, and their intentions. </p>
<p>Reginald Hill writes for an intelligent reader - this book is 
rich with references to literature and music. He has a knack
for describing things in a way which makes you pay attention.
Here he is saying someone has a good memory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wield's brain, which his CID chief, Andy Dalziel, opinied 
should be picked in strong ale and and sold to IBM after the
sergeant's death, had been punching up references to Enscombe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here he says the same character is hairy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wield barked the sound which his friends recognized as his way
of expressing amusement - though others often took it as a 
sign that the interrupted lycanthropic process suggested by
his face was about to be resumed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not writing for a lazy reader.</p>
<p>I very much enjoyed this book; I liked the characters, I liked
the relationships, I liked the mystery.</p>

<p>Delphine has gotten to be pretty picky at the dinner
table, and after one too many "I hate this!"es, Blake
and I decided to let Delphine pick every dinner this
week. Blake walked her through picking things that
are on sale, and he also advised her on the standard
protein-vegetable-starch distribution of a meal.</p>
<p>So this is what we're having this week. Try and guess
which words Delphine wrote and which were Blake's (Blake
likes Random Capitalization and Punctuation):</p>
<ul>
<li>Mashed Potatoes &amp; Hot Dogs AND (charred) ESPARAGIS</li>
<li>Pizza with Pepperoni &amp; Tomato</li>
<li>Chicken Sandwiches &amp; cut up apples &amp; Corn on the cob.</li>
<li>Burritos (Beans, tomato, cooked carrots, cheese)</li>
<li>SRINP ring AND GRILD cheese SANWICHES BOK CHOY???</li>
</ul>
<p>Should be a tasty week.</p>
