<p>Both the girls "graduated" last week, Delphine from Senior Kindergarten,
and Cordelia from Nursery School. There is some division
of opinion on these early graduations: Some people seem to think
they're idiotic—graduating from kindergarten?! Seriously?—while
others, mostly parents, think they're charming. I'm in the latter
camp: a rite of passage is a rite of passage, even if you're
only three feet tall. Both Cordelia's life and Delphine's are
going to be very different in September, and I think that's 
worth acknowledging.</p>
<p>Cordelia is starting Junior Kindergarten in fall, in the mornings.
We haven't met her teacher yet because she's going to be new
to the school, and I have no idea who else is going to be in 
her class. All we know is which room she's going to be in.
She's familiar with the school, though, from dropping off
and picking up Delphine for the last two years. She's thrilled
to be going to "my sister's school". (She refers to Delphine
almost exclusively as "my sister".)</p>
<p>Delphine is starting Grade One in fall, and we'll find out 
tomorrow who her teacher is going to be. She's alternately
scared and excited about Grade One. I'm excited about finally
being able to buy school supplies.</p>
<hr>
<p>Cordelia has a new passion: chewing gum. I always used to
judge, a teeny bit, people who let little kids chew
gum, but as in so many ways, I have become that which I 
judged. I have to limit her to one piece of gum a day. She
likes the minty kinds.</p>
<p>Delphine's new passion is <em>Dirty Jobs</em>, which she likes to
watch every day. I figure it's an informative window
into the grown-up world, and it will give her some idea of 
how much work goes into making the food and objects which
appear in our house. And into cleaning skulls and preparing
owl pellets. She calls Mike Rowe "Mark".</p>
<hr>
<p>Delphine and Cordelia were enjoying a marathon TV session
on Saturday morning, when <em>Saddle Club</em> came on. <em>Saddle Club</em>
is one of those cheap soap operas in which Australia seems
to specialise—this one is set at some kind of horsey school
and is aimed at, I assume, "tweens". Delphine doesn't watch
it regularly but she enjoys it when she catches it. I think it's
rubbish, and when it came on I huffed and rolled my eyes. 
Delphine said, "What?"</p>
<p>"I don't like this show. There's too much melodrama and people
getting upset with each other."</p>
<p>Blake cut in with, "They don't talk to each other about their
problems, they just get mad."</p>
<p>I said, "No-one acts like that in real life."</p>
<p>Delphine gazed at us levelly. "Maybe they just want to make it
exciting."</p>
<p>Well, I guess I don't need to worry about her media awareness.</p>
<hr>
<p>I went to Value Village today. (Blake stayed home and looked
after the children, so they don't appear in this story. Sorry.)
My mum sent me some money for my birthday, because I said I
wanted to buy myself some new clothes.  I thought the money would
go further if I shopped at VV instead of Addition-Elle or
Lands' End.</p>
<p>The trouble with living in a middle-class neighbourhood 
surrounded by more middle-class neighbourhoods
is that you have to travel a long way to get to a second-hand store.
My second-hand-shopping maven friend told me that the
Value Village at Landsdown is the best one, so off I trekked. A
bus trip (it was too hot to walk to the subway station) and
a long subway ride (with a transfer!) later, I arrived at Landsdown.
I can't comment on how nice the Landsdown area is, because it
was 30 degrees today and there's a municipal strike on; I 
imagine every Toronto neighbourhood looked like shit today.</p>
<p>The Value Village at Landsdown is huge, it's like a small
Zellers. I managed to find beautiful dresses for the girls to
wear to the two weddings we're invited to this summer, and then
I started shopping for myself.</p>
<p>How is it possible that I'm too fat to be a size 18 in the
dress section, but too thin to be a size 20? (Also why are there
so many ugly dresses? Did the <em>Golden Girls</em> Fan Club and
Drag Show recently clean out its closet?) Further, how is
it then possible that I can be too thin to be a size 18 in the
pants section? How is it possible that there was only one
cute dress that fit me, but dozens of sweaters and shirts? Do
fat women not buy cute dresses? Or do they buy them and then
hang on to them for dear life?</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing was how unevenly placed the sizes
were; I found clothes that fit me (and many more that didn't) 
in the size 16, size 18 
and size 20 sections. Some of those clothes had the original
store size labels on, and the VV staff had faithfully placed
the clothes in the section that matched the label. Which, of
course, is a failure. I'm an XL at Cotton Ginny, 
a L at Tabi, and a 1X at Addition-Elle, but I don't fit into
Reitman's XL, or really most other labels' XL. I'm a 16 pant 
at Lands' End and a 18 at Addition-Elle. So even if you
do place clothes in the label-appropriate section, you won't 
get consistency in section sizes.</p>
<p>VV has a chance to correct the vagaries of women's clothing 
sizes; surely it would be simple to have a template in the
back room against which staff could hold up each donated
item of clothing,
to sort it into the right bin. Even if you only picked one
dimension—waist for pants, say, and bust for 
dresses—once you found the size that matched your body, 
you would be one variable closer to finding something that fit.</p>
<p>This was only my second VV trip, and I think I've decided it
isn't worth it. It's a long trip to get there, it took me 
forever to find clothes to try on, I had to wait for a change
room, and then only about
fifteen percent of them fit. And after all that, of course, it's
another long way to come home again. If there were a location
nearer to here I might go again—they're opening some
new locations, but I fear we are too embedded in Richville to
ever get a thrift shop nearby.</p>
<p>After all that, I didn't even find a dress for myself to wear
to the weddings. Tomorrow I will call the local consignment
stores (without much hope) to see whether they carry my size.
I expect I will end up going to Addition-Elle, which is no
loss; I still have a good chunk of my birthday money left.
(That's the great thing about VV: two sweaters, three shirts,
one pair of pants, two pairs of earrings, a hat, and two 
kid's dresses for $70. Seriously!)</p>

    <div>
<p>(I rewrote this entry to be shorter and hopefully more useful.)</p>
<p>I'm on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. I love 
Twitter—it's a fun way to stay connected, get 
the latest news, and to share ideas and news of my own.</p>
<p>Some of my friends have signed on to Twitter, tried it for
a couple of days, and never returned. I'm going to try and
explain how I use Twitter which makes it so fun and useful
for me, in the hope that people
will try it, or try it again. Because when it comes to
Twitter, the more the merrier!</p>
<p>Before I go on, I will quickly explain how Twitter works.
You probably already know it's a site where you can post
140 character messages. The messages can be read by anyone
who "follows" you.  </p>
<p>Your Twitter page also shows 
your "Twitter feed", which is a display of all the messages
("tweets") posted by people you follow. Note that
you don't have to follow the people who follow you, and the
people you follow don't have to follow you.</p>
<h5>Getting Started</h5>
<p>Signing up to Twitter is easy—the hardest part is
picking a good username. After you have signed in, fill 
in your Location and a short Bio, to make it easier for
people to find you and decide whether to follow you.</p>
<h5>Finding your Tweeps</h5>
<p>Once you're in, you need to follow some people. But who,
and how many? 
The real key to making Twitter work for you is balancing
the number of people you follow and the frequency with which
you check in. If you don't follow enough people, Twitter will
be boring and pointless and you'll lose interest. If you follow
too many people, your feed will be too busy and you won't be
able to keep up. </p>
<p>I'm going to throw out the number 75 as the minimum number of people you
should follow to keep things interesting. Of course, it will
depend how voluble your followees are, and how often
you can check in to Twitter. (I follow 225 people, and check in
four or five times a day, and I'm seldom either bored or
overwhelmed.)</p>
<p>Finding people to follow is the fun part. There are plenty of
ways to find people. You probably already know 
a few people who are on, so find out what their Twitter
usernames are and check out who they are following like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the person's Twitter page: http://www.twitter.com/username</li>
<li>On the right you'll see a number with "following" under 
  it—click on that number to see the list of people your
  friend follows.</li>
<li>Now you can click "follow" to follow anyone you like the look of.
  If you're not sure, you can click on any username to go to
  <em>their</em> Twitter page, which will show you all their tweets from
  latest to oldest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow anyone who looks interesting—it's really easy to 
unfollow people later. (When you follow someone they get an 
email notification, but when you unfollow them they don't.)</p>
<p>You can also find people using the "Find People"
option, at the top of the Twitter window. There, you can find 
people who are in your email contacts, or you can search for people
by name. </p>
<p>How do you decide who to follow? That's up to you; I look
for people who post interesting things about what they are
doing, and interesting links. Funny is good too.  I avoid 
people who only seem
to @reply to other people, and people who mainly RT (retweet). 
Interaction is nice but I like to read original thoughts too.  </p>
<p>You can also follow institutions and entities you
have a relationship with in real life, like 
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/starbucks">@starbucks</a> or 
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/globebooks">@globebooks</a>, and of
course a few celebrities are fun. I follow
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/SlashHudson">@SlashHudson</a>,
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/Jeffrey_Donovan">@Jeffrey_Donovan</a>,
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/donttrythis">@donttrythis</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Another interesting way to find people is 
<a href="http://www.tweetmondo.com">Tweetmondo</a>, a site which
lets you find Twitterers who live nearby. I found
a couple of people in my neighbourhood, and it's neat
to read their tweets about weather and local happenings.</p>
<h5>How Often To Twit</h5>
<p>Twitter works best for people who are online 
all the time, but you can still have fun with Twitter if you 
only get to your computer once or twice a day—you will 
just have to scroll down a few pages to catch up, or only
read the latest couple of pages and your @replies.</p>
<p>I don't think it would work to check Twitter less than once
a day, or maybe every couple of days at the very least. Twitter
is an of-the-moment medium and the more involved you are, 
the more you'll get out of it.</p>
<h5>About @replies</h5>
<p>One of the best things about Twitter is the @reply system. 
@replies are a way to directly address another
Twitter user. You put their username in your tweet,
with an @ sign before it. For example, if you want to
@reply me, include "@amyrhoda" in your tweet. Your tweet 
will be specially flagged for me to read when I log on.</p>
<p>You can also reply to a specific tweet by clicking
the little curly arrow which appears to the right of the tweet
when you mouse over it.</p>
<p>To read your @replies, click on @yourusername
on the right-hand column of the Twitter page. 
If you don't have much time to Twitter, you can always
check your @replies page to make sure you read and
respond to tweets addressed directly to you. </p>
<p>If you want to send a message to another user, but don't want
it to be public, start the message with "d username". This
will send them a Direct Message which can only be read by
that user. Read your Direct Messages by clicking on the
Direct Message link on the right column of your Twitter page.</p>
<h5>Following Back</h5>
<p>As I mentioned above, you will receive an email message
whenever someone follows you. Do you have to follow back 
everyone who follows you? No.  I tend to set the "should I
follow" bar a little lower for new followers, but I still
won't follow you if you're not a real person, if you don't
have any updates, or if you're unspeakably lame. Say.  </p>
<h5>Have Fun</h5>
<p>Some people take Twitter way too seriously. It's not
a popularity contest. It's not a major marketing tool. You're
not obliged to tweet, to retweet (repeat someone else's
tweet to pass it on to your followers), to @reply, to follow 
certain people, to participate in #followfriday, or anything
else. </p>
<p>Use Twitter however you like, however it works for you.
It's a great, fun way to connect with people. You just 
have to find the right set of Tweeters
to follow, and figure out the rhythm of Tweeting that works 
for you.</p>

<p>I just started making compost in my backyard, and because
I can't scratch my nose without intensive research,
I took a couple books out of the library.  Both named <em>Compost</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Compost</em></strong> <strong>by Ken Thompson</strong> is a glossy, beautifully 
produced little book published by the always-extravagant DK.
As well as being gorgeously designed and illustrated, it's
simple, to-the-point and includes everything you need to 
know to get started composting. It's thorough and scientific, yet
readable and above all, encouraging.</p>
<p><strong><em>Compost</em></strong> <strong>by Clare Foster</strong> covers about the same
material as the Thompson, but it's much dryer, preachier, and 
lacks the pretty pictures.</p>
<p>I also re-read <strong><em>Freakonomics</em></strong> <strong>by Steven D. Levitt and
Stephen J. Dubner</strong> for the non-fiction book club at the
library. (What is that book, like, four years old? It
would be nice to read something newer in the book club.)
It was good to reread this, especially
having read <em>Punished by Rewards</em> by Alfie Kohn which
addresses the issue of incentives. The Steves talk about
how everything can be explained by incentives, but then
give some examples which have clearly been disproven,
as shown in Kohn's book. That doesn't affect the 
plausibility of the Steves' arguments, though, because
despite talking about incentives in the introduction
they don't lean on them much throughout the book.</p>
<p>I liked this book the second time as much as I liked it
the first time. I relish the use of data to
understand the world in ways which are contrary to
popular wisdom, whether it's called economics or 
statistics or sociology.</p>

<p>Yesterday I got into a TwitFight. Not even a fight: There's
this guy on Twitter who posts the same advice every day. Literally,
the exact same Twit, every day. It's a "daily reminder". I
said to him, in a lighthearted way, that I would stop following 
him if he Twitted that again. One thing led to another and I
said I thought it was presumptuous to give out the same advice
every day (actually I said he was nagging), and he said it 
was presumptuous of me to assume he cares. Whatever. Tiny 
little disagreement about something of negligible importance 
with someone I don't know who means nothing to me.</p>
<p>How did I respond to this disagreement? Did I transfer my 
attention to something worthy of my time, maybe one of the
blogs I enjoy, or perhaps my children? My friends? No.
I let it get to me: my heart rate went up, I got nervous and
twitchy, I couldn't stop thinking about it.  I tried to talk
myself down, to get some perspective, to distract myself,
but my mind kept wandering back to the disagreement. I couldn't
stop thinking about it: was I wrong? Was the guy right? Should
I respond back to him? Would my friends back me up? Why was
he being a dick about it? <em>Was</em> he being a dick about it? Why
would he think that people want to read the same piece of advice
every day anyway? Should
I not have said anything? The thoughts kept buzzing around, 
almost beyond my control.</p>
<p>It's not just this time. The same thing happens whenever I get into
an altercation with anyone. It's been happening when I 
get into fights on the Internet
as long as I've been on the Internet, and it happens in
real life too, on the rare occasion when I have the balls
to disagree with someone who is within arm's reach. Any
fight, no matter how minor, results in hours of analysis
and worrying and anxiety. </p>
<p>I can't bear conflict.  I don't like 
people to disagree with me; when they do, I get defensive,
I get nervous, I second-guess myself. I try and get my
friends to take my side, or at least I reassure myself that
they would. I forget that I'm an
intelligent person who is entitled to disagree with others.
I forget that I don't need a bunch of people backing me up to be
right. I have a brain, I can have an opinion without taking a
poll of all my friends first. </p>
<p>Why do I have such a strong physical and emotional
reaction when I get into an argument with someone? Is it
just lack of practice? Is it some relic from my childhood?
Perhaps the more important question is, how do I get
over it? Maybe I need to pick more fights so that I 
learn to deal better.</p>

<p>The end of the school year draws near and everything is
starting to ease off. First, choir ended, freeing up my Monday
nights. Then Delphine's Sparks year ended, then Music Together.
Now all that's left is school: Cordelia has two 
weeks and Delphine has three. They both have "graduation" 
ceremonies, Cordelia's to celebrate the end of Nursery School
and advancement to Kindergarten, and Delphine's to celebrate the
end of Kindergarten and advancement to Grade One. Fall 2009
is going to be huge around here.</p>
<p>Cordelia is invited to visit her new kindergarten teacher
and see her next classroom the Wednesday after next. As
you can imagine, she's beside herself with excitement
to be going to the same school as her adored big sister.
(And yes, they do adore each other, as we discovered this
weekend when Delphine was away overnight and Cordelia kept
asking when she would be home.)</p>
<p>The excitement begins anew the week after school's out:
the girls are signed up for two weeks of swimming lessons,
every morning for half-an-hour. Then we have one 
honest-to-goodness week off before Delphine has a week of
all day camp downtown. The following Tuesday we're off 
to Sask to spend two weeks with Granny, who the girls adore.</p>
<p>No sooner are we back from Sask than the girls go
to the cottage with Baba and Zaida for a few days. It's a
small cottage so Blake and I aren't invited this year, which
is fine. I like the cottage fine but it's not a must-do.
(It just occurred to me that this will be the first time 
Blake and I have been away from the girls for more than 
a night. Whatever will we do?)</p>
<p>The following week, both girls are in a day camp nearby for a
week, and then we have two more weeks off before school
starts again. This summer is the opposite of last summer's
unscheduled bliss. We'll have to see which is better. I think
I might have overdone it with the camps and stuff this
year, but it might turn out to be just right.</p>
<hr>
<p>Delphine has a loose tooth! There are a couple of girls
in her class who have lost lots of teeth, dozens and dozens 
of them.  One of the girls started losing teeth in JK! So of course
Delphine is miffed that she hasn't lost any yet. I've been
periodically checking her teeth to see if they're loose, and
today one on the bottom middle was a little bit wiggly.
(It might even be the first tooth that came in.) She was
beside herself with excitement. </p>
<p>The bad news is, I asked online
how long it takes one of these things to come out once
they start wiggling, and apparently it's one to four months.
Four months! She might be in Grade One before this tooth
finally comes out. It will give me time to get used to the
idea of her beautiful tiny white baby teeth being
replaced by those disproportionate tombstones little kids
are stuck with.</p>
<hr>
<p>Blake got a job. Well, kind of. He got a four month, full-time
contract. With Mozilla—cool. Unfortunately it doesn't
come with an office. We've been trying to figure out what he's
going to do with himself in order to get eight working hours
in every day—since he got laid off he's been consistently
doing contract work, but never eight hours a day, so he's been
able to hang around the house and get distracted by us without
falling too far behind.</p>
<p>He has an open invitation to work at U of T, but that's a 
significant commute, and I'm not sure whether the undergrads 
are more or less distracting than me and the girls.  There's 
two hours of free wi-fi at Starbucks, which is where I would
go every morning. There's the library—I
would go to the library, too, but I don't know if that
would work for Blake.</p>
<p>Incidentally, in addition to this full-time contract, Blake
still has two other contract jobs on the go, so I might not
be seeing much of him for the next little while. Hopefully he
can get lots of work done when the girls and I are in Sask.</p>
<hr>
<p>I think that's all, apart from that I planted some Irish moss and 
creeping jenny in the front yard between the neighbour's yard
and our path. I'm not sure how well it's going to do, but the
neighbours two doors down have some creeping jenny which is 
thriving, so I expect it will be okay. Provided I water
it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Oh, I forgot to mention in my last post that Delphine and
my conversation about World Wars ended with a rousing chorus
of "Sniper, no sniping!"</p>

<p>This evening at dinner Blake was talking to Cordelia about
names. He asked what her name is. She replied "Cordelia
Winton!" (It's not.) He asked her what Delphine's name is:
"Delphine Winton!" He asked her what my name is: "Mummy
Winton!"</p>
<hr>
<p>Delphine is at Auntie Morgan's place for her birthday sleepover
tonight. They went out for dinner, and tomorrow they're going
to Sunnybrook Park, among other things. Sunnybrook Park was
Delphine's choice, even though I don't think she's ever been
there. I hope it lives up to her expectations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Cordelia is home with us for a sleepunder. One of
the perks of a sleepunder is getting to choose dinner—we
had Chinese. Another is that you get to sleep in the Big Bed
if you want to. So far no-one has ever taken us up on the Big
Bed thing, but Cordelia's in the Big Bed right now. (It's nine
o' clock and she's not asleep yet, so she may yet end up sleeping
in her own bed.)</p>
<p>Tomorrow we might go out for breakfast, but we spent a lot
of money on dinner so maybe not. The school in which Cordelia's
nursery school is located is having their spring fair, so we
might go to that too. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>It was pleasant having only Cordelia tonight. She's 
charming and funny and nice to be around. Oddly (not
really) when Delphine is around they're both annoying about
forty percent of the time. Yet Delphine is great by herself too;
we hung out together this morning at Yonge and Eg and she
wasn't annoying or snotty, she was mellow and interesting and
engaged. Blake and I thought there could
be a real future in a boarding school with a Sibling 
Mutual Exclusivity Schedule Option.</p>
<hr>
<p>The other day Delphine and I had a long conversation about
World Wars. It started when we stopped to look at an old
print of a WWII battleship in a storefront on Mount Pleasant.
Delphine wanted to know who started the war, who fought,
how they fought, who won. The whole conversation made me
realize how little I know about it—I guess it's time
for a trip to the library... We talked about different kinds
of guns, about guns on airplanes, about tanks.  I told her 
about attacks on cities. I told her about the
Enigma machine. We talked about what Daddy would do if there
was another World War—we decided we hope he would stay
home and work the computers, not go into battle.</p>
<p>It was an interesting conversation. It reminded me once again
about the incredibly huge amount of knowledge you have to 
absorb before you can even begin to understand our world. I
mean, not only do you have to know about the World Wars, you
also have to know about the Holocaust and slavery and the
Black Death. You have to know about The Beatles and Elvis
and Queen and Fred Astaire and tap dancing. You have to know
about gasoline and dinosaurs and planets and the atmosphere.
You have to know how to wash cotton, how to cook rice, how
to floss, how to make a new friend, how to approach a strange
dog, how to use the phone and the library. The human brain 
is astonishing.  I'm reminded of that when Delphine and 
I come up against some huge body of knowledge which she's 
hardly begun to explore. There's so much for her to 
learn. But she's made a pretty good start.</p>
<p>Apparently the World Wars conversation has provided
plenty of playtime fodder. The following day Delphine told
me that she and Pierce and Jaime played castles in school,
and they bombed and shot at each other's castles. What fun!</p>

<p><strong><em>Copyediting: A Practical Guide</em></strong> <strong>by Karen Judd</strong> is another guide
to copyediting very much like the last one I read, <em>The
Fine Art of Copyediting</em> by Elsie Myers Stainton. Both offer an
overview of what copyediting entails, along with lots of reference
material: when to use which punctuation, how to capitalize titles,
and so on. Either book would be a valuable addition to a writer
or copyeditor's library.</p>
<p>I don't think copyediting is a good career direction for me;
I revel in the satisfaction of finding obvious mistakes (doesn't everyone?) 
but I would get impatient having to look up everything I wasn't sure
about.  I could be a copyeditor, but I wouldn't enjoy it much.
(Although Judd actually says, 'Copyediting isn't fun," so maybe I'm
missing the point.) But having read these two books, I now know more
about good grammar, good writing and punctuation. Once I start
writing for real I'll buy one of these books and refer to it often.
My editors will love me.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Craft and Business of Writing: Essential Tools for Writing 
Success</em></strong> is a collection of essays about writing, from the
editors of Writers' Digest Books. It's divided
into five sections: Getting Started / General Business, Fiction,
Nonfiction, Children's Writing, and Poetry. Each of the last four
sections is further subdivided into "The Craft of..." and "The
Business of..." The essays are great, both helpful and inspiring.
However, for some reason
they chose to wire-bind the book and wrap it in a giant hardcover like
a big ol' cookbook. Made it very hard to read it in bed,
while brushing teeth, on the can, etc: all my best reading 
spots. So it has taken me weeks to read it. Between the dry-as-dust 
copyediting books and this I've been all clogged up in my reading.</p>
<hr>
<p>A while ago <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/">Greg Wilson</a> suggested I
write a book about survival in the event of a disaster or
collapse of our modern infrastructure.  Seemed like a fine
idea, so I thought I would find out what was already out there.
A few years ago I read James Howard Kunstler's <em>The Long
Emergency: Surviving the Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First
Century</em>, and I briefly revisited it. Then as now, it left me more
scared than prepared. The book mainly discusses what's going to
go horribly wrong. The last chapter deals with how we might manage
the process, but it's mainly prognostication and very little advice.</p>
<p>However, <strong><em>When All Hell Breaks Loose: Stuff You Need to Survive When 
Disaster Strikes</em></strong> <strong>by Cody Lundin</strong> is rich in advice on how to
survive a week or a few months without the modern conveniences we
take for granted. </p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts: "Head Candy" 
and "Hand Candy". Head Candy covers a wide range of philosophical, 
psychological, and physiological concerns, including posttraumatic 
stress disorder, consensus decision making, the power of gratitude, 
the importance of positive thinking. . . . Plenty of the material is
valuable, such as the importance of continuing to communicate
with your family, recognizing the signs of excess stress in 
others, and the impact of fear on physical function, but there's
plenty that could be left out too. There's a lot of woo-woo stuff
about thinking positive, and putting good vibes into the universe to
get good stuff back.</p>
<p>You're 84 pages into the book
before you get into the nitty-gritty of what you're gonna need
and how much of it.  That's the Hand Candy section, each 
chapter of which covers a
particular need: shelter, water, food, sewage
disposal, hygiene, light, heat for cooking, first-aid, self-defense,
communication, transport, and how to get out if you have to.<br>
Although the book is written in a light-hearted, humourous way, 
Lundin doesn't
talk down to his readers: each chapter starts with a technical description
of the matter at hand. For example, in the food chapter Lundin 
discusses the
different sources of calories (protein, fat and carbs) and how the 
body metabolizes each one.  He also devotes a page to explaining
the Glycemic Index, two to calculating your Basal Metabolic Rate, 
and three on an overview of Great Food Shortages in History, most
of which resulted in people eating each other (just in case you
weren't sure whether you wanted to store some food).  The light
section has two pages on the history of artificial lighting and
a one-page primer on batteries. And so on.</p>
<p>I would call this book over-written. Or maybe under-edited. Personally,
I love all this information, but then I thrive on non-fiction. 
I'm not sure that the average reader wants this much background 
in a book of this nature. However, if you can get through all 
the extra stuff, the advice in here is gold. Lundin has years 
of hands-on experience
living off the grid, living in the wild and leading survival 
courses. The book is rich with anecdotes and advice direct from 
experience, and when Lundin doesn't know something and couldn't
find it out, he's blunt about it. (Like, how long does whole
wheat keep anyway?)  He is pragmatic and considerate of 
all your family members—for example, a couple of times he
specifically addresses the needs of obese people without
being judgemental.</p>
<p>I took copious notes while reading this
book, and I now have a very long list of things to do and buy. Once
I've done them all I will feel much more prepared in the event of
something going horribly wrong for quite a long time.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you should think that planning for a long-term
failure of some or most of our infrastructure is paranoid, you
might not know that the CDC's worse-case scenario pandemic
plan involves the general public staying home for up to three
months. Or maybe a <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16400-major-solar-storm-could-cause-lasting-damage.html">solar storm</a> will knock
out the power grid indefinitely. The fact is I'd rather be 
ready and wrong.</p>

<p>This post could be filed under either "books" or
under "Delphine", because as usual, in
<strong><em>Your Six-Year-Old: Loving and Defiant</em></strong>, <strong>Louise Bates
Ames and Frances Ilg</strong> have nailed the phase my kid
is going through like they were observing her
personally.  Here are some quotes from the book
which describe what's going on around here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things often get so bad around the house that, as one
mother put it, "Each morning I get up with the solemn 
promise to myself to try and make my daughter fell loved. 
And I may succeed for an hour or so. But then she'll do 
something so impossible that I lose my temper and have to 
reprimand her." [I usually do better than an hour or so;
Delphine's pretty great in the mornings. It's after school
that she's almost intolerable.]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Six's way is, in his opinion, right; he cannot bear to lose 
or to accept criticism. On the other hand, he loves to be
flattered and praised. Certainly he is not as secure as 
he might be.  In fact, we believe that much of his stubborn, 
arrogant, and sometimes bratty behavior is his effort to build 
himself up and to make himself feel secure.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>His capacity for enjoyment is tremendous. Make him a present
or surprise, give him praise, propose a treat, and his vigorously
expressed joy and enthusiasm will well repay you. [Delphine
often tells me I'm "the best mum ever!" for something as 
simple as ice cream for dessert.]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Six is at his best and also his worst with the <em>primary</em>
caregiver.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>[On siblings] But on the whole, his competitive, combative
nature and his need to always be first and to win out, make certain
difficulty in the household. . . . He tends to be very jealous
of attention or objects given to to a brother or sister. . . .
Six may be very bossy with younger siblings. He may argue,
tease, bully, frighten, torment, get angry, hit.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>If your daughter is one of the many with a very sensitive
scalp, who screams bloody murder as you comb her hair, a short
haircut (if she will accept it [hah]) can save much anguish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously Ames and Ilg have Delphine's number. They also have
some insight into why it's so difficult to be six:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the Six-year-old's biggest problems is his relationship
with his mother. It gives him the greatest pleasure and the
greatest pain. Most adore their mother, think the world of
her, need to be assured and reassured that she loves them. 
At the same time, whenever things go wrong, they take things
out on her.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>We must remember that a Six-year-old isn't violent, loud,
demanding, and often naughty just to be bad. There are so
many things he wants to do and be that his choices are not 
always fortunate. He is so extremely anxious to do well, 
to be the best, to be first, to be loved and praise, that 
any failure is very hard for him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They offer a list of helpful techniques: praise, chances (second, third,
etc), counting, sidestepping the issue, bargaining, giving 
in, ignoring misbehaviour. It's not the most rigorous year
of parenting, but it seems that Six is a year to be 
endured, for child and parent alike, at least until Six-and-a-half.</p>
