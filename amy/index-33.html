<p><strong><em>Twelve Books That Changed the World</em></strong> <strong>by Melvyn Bragg</strong> is
a book that introduces itself. I believe it's a
tie-in book to a TV series, the kind of TV series that could
only be produced in England. The books range from the
St James Bible to Mary Woolstonecraft's <em>A Vindication of the 
Rights of Woman</em> and, curiously, <em>Rules of Association
Football</em>. Each book is described, put into context, and Bragg
makes his arguments for why it belongs in this list. This is
a great introduction to some seminal written works, but also
a brisk and effective overview of some high points of our society's history.</p>
<p><strong><em>Further Under the Duvet</em></strong> <strong>by Marian Keyes</strong> was recommended
to me by someone on Twitter (I think it was 
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/flossieteacake">FlossieTeacake</a>)
after a discussion of villa-itis, or the fear that you are going
to run out of bread while staying at a French villa. (I have
a chronic case of villa-itis which is villa-independent.) The book
is a collection of personal essays and short stories. Keyes is an Irish
writer with an extraordinary Cinderella story of going
from abject alcoholism to fame and riches as a writer. The story
is told in the book, along with essays on various topics including
the joy of writing
a makeup column (free samples!), air-guitar championships, shopping
and plenty of chocolate. Funny and sweet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Positive Discipline</em></strong> <strong>by Dr. Jane Nelsen</strong> is yet
another positive/democratic/whatever parenting book. I don't know
why I keep reading them, since I more-or-less know what I'm doing
by now, but it's good to be reminded, and I do pick up different
ideas from the various books. This particular book reminded me
of the importance of family meetings, and reassured me that some
problems (namely chores) will have to be revisited at regular
intervals but are still worth handling democratically. I wouldn't
call this my favourite democratic parenting book—it's just
not funny enough. But it's worth a look if you need a refresher
(or an introduction to positive parenting) or if you want a new
angle.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Gargoyle</em></strong> <strong>by Andrew Davidson</strong> is our first book club book
of the year, and already this year's book club roster is looking better
than last year's. <em>The Gargoyle</em> is about a man who gets terribly
burned in a car crash, then meets a mysterious woman with a
bizarre past while he's recovering. It's about love and redemption
and all that good stuff, with a big dose of history. It's beautifully
written and I didn't want it to end.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right</em></strong> <strong>by Atul Gawande</strong>.
I have long been a fan of the checklist. I like to-do lists to keep
my days focused, I like lists of things to take places, I like
to record our daily routines in list form so nothing is forgotten.
This book is the validation for my checklist habit: Gawande writes
about how checklists can improve the outcome of extremely complex
projects, such as construction projects, and surgeries. Checklists
are already in use in construction and aviation, and the book centres
on Gawande and his team's attempt to create a checklist to reduce
the number of fatalities as a result of surgeries. It's not a smooth
path, but along the way we learn the kinds of checklists (DO-CONFIRM
and READ-DO), what makes a good checklist (not too much information,
easy to read), what makes a bad checklist (too long), and the
mind-boggling difference that a checklist can make in a process that
everyone involved feels is already going pretty well. (Gawande
uses his own checklist, and at first he thought it wouldn't make
much difference to <em>his</em> outcomes. As it turns out, not a week
goes by that the checklist doesn't catch something he would have
missed, and it has even saved at least one life on his watch).</p>
<p>As usual, Gawande is engaging and convincing. This was a great
read as well as a confirmation (and refinement) of my love for
checklists.</p>

<p>You might know that, until recently, Delphine was just too sensitive
to watch movies. Any kind of suspense or peril would send her running
for the farthest corner of the house. But lately she's become more 
blase about everything, and she is much cooler about scary bits
in movies. "Actually this is pretty scary," she will say, while
holding her ground on the couch. So, we've been watching movies.</p>
<p>We started a while ago with <em>The Sound of Music</em>, which is really quite scary
what with the Nazis and all. (Although Delphine was more scared of
the stern father.) Then a few weeks ago we rented <em>Cloudy
With A Chance of Meatballs</em>, then <em>Nanny McPhee</em>. We decided to
have a regular movie night every weekend. After some discussion
we've decided to have matinees so as to avoid too much pre-bedtime
excitement and bad dreams. I'm excited to introduce the girls to some great
movies, and to get back to watching movies myself, even
if only PG-rated ones.</p>
<p>Last week we watched <em>Star Wars</em> (the original one). Cordelia
was really excited to see it, and Delphine enjoyed it in the end.
I think they both liked making sense of all the
stuff the boys in their classes jabber about. Although Delphine 
was very confused as to why Ethan would dress up as a bad guy—Darth
Vader—for Halloween. I couldn't help her.</p>
<p>Here's our list of movies to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bedknobs and Broomsticks</li>
<li>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</li>
<li>Seven Brides for Seven Brothers</li>
<li>Mary Poppins</li>
<li>Fiddler on the Roof</li>
<li>Toy Story</li>
<li>Beauty and the Beast</li>
<li>The Princess and the Frog</li>
<li>Alladin</li>
<li>The Aristocats? (This is the first movie I saw in a theatre, but I can't
remember if I liked it.)</li>
<li>Shrek</li>
<li>The Lion King</li>
<li>The Iron Giant</li>
<li>It's a Wonderful Life</li>
<li>The Muppet Movie</li>
<li>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</li>
<li>Darby O'Gill and the Little People</li>
<li>The Incredibles</li>
<li>Nightmare Before Christmas</li>
<li>Escape from Witch Mountain</li>
<li>The Wizard of Oz</li>
<li>To Kill a Mockingbird (maybe later)</li>
<li>The Princess Bride</li>
<li>E.T.</li>
<li>Fantasia</li>
<li>Babe</li>
<li>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</li>
<li>Miracle on 34th Street</li>
<li>The Parent Trap</li>
<li>Swiss Family Robinson</li>
<li>My Neighbour Totoro</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other classic, or great, kid or kid-friendly movies we should see?
Dave, what about Miyazaki? What do you like?</p>
<p>(Oh, and Columbine's post about <a href="http://www.eccentricflower.com/index.php/Eccentric_Flower:201002/Alice">Alice in Wonderland</a> is quite apropos.)</p>

<p>Blake has been away for two weeks on business. It's the first time he's
ever been away for more than a couple of nights, and before he left
I was worried
that it would be impossible and miserable to manage by myself.</p>
<p>Blake's coming home tonight, and his absence has taught me a few things:</p>
<p><strong>Blake doesn't do much around the house</strong>. I've suspected this for a long
time, but now I'm sure. I didn't perceive <em>any</em> change in the amount of
housework or childcare I do from when he was here to when he wasn't.
Obviously this sucks and has to change. I get that he has a job and
earns all the money, but I work hard too and I think everyone should
help out at home, I don't want my children growing up thinking
that housework is women's work, and I can't do any kind of freelance
work or self-improvement if I'm spending all my time doing other
people's scut work.</p>
<p>Sorry, that turned out to be kind of a rant, didn't it?</p>
<p>Anyway, that led me quite smoothly to realization number two:
<strong>I don't need him</strong>. Obviously I love him, and of course
we need his healthy income.
What I mean is I don't need him to keep the house and family running:
I can manage by myself. This is tremendously empowering. I was
honestly worried that somehow everything would fall apart without
Blake here. That <em>I</em> would fall apart without him. (Yes, apparently
being married has turned me into a jelly.)</p>
<p>This leads, somewhat less directly, to the next realization:
<strong>I still want him around.</strong> We've been married for ten years,
and we're attached to each other through this house, through
the children, and through habit. Sometimes it seems like all those things
are doing the work of keeping us together, and the spark and
affection which brought us together in the first place
has become irrelevant. </p>
<p>I'm trying to write about this without making it sound like I've
been plotting a divorce. I swear I haven't, I love being married
to Blake and we're always going to be awesome together. But for
a while there it looked like we were together because I didn't 
have any choice. Now that I know I have a choice, however hypothetical,
it makes it much more satisfying to be together. It means we're
here because we want to be—because we like each other—not 
because it's the only option.</p>
<p>Here's another thing I learned: <strong>I don't do housework 
either</strong>. I never thought I was doing housework for Blake's benefit,
but the house has gotten slightly more disheveled than usual in the
last two weeks. It's not so much that I'm cleaning <em>for</em> Blake—I
don't think he could care less. It's more that having another adult
around adds a level of accountability that keeps me honest. If I can
get away with it, I don't clean. Good
thing I had company today: at least the main floor and the bathroom
are clean.</p>
<p>I noticed is that I'm a lot happier to do the housework
I <em>do</em> do when I don't have someone to resent for not doing it instead.
I think once we've worked out some kind of respectable chore schedule
I'll be much happier to do <em>my</em> jobs, secure in the knowledge that
I'm not doing <em>all</em> the jobs.</p>
<p>Last one: <strong>it's nice to be the only decision-maker</strong>. Not so 
nice that I'd
want to do it all the time, but there is something about not
having to discuss everything: meals, plans, jobs, whose turn it is 
in the shower, all that chatter and negotiation. It's not
something that bothers me normally, but it's nice when it's not
there, like the silence when the power goes out.  </p>
<p>Tonight the silence ends and we get our man back. I wasn't happy
to see him go, but I'll be very happy to have him back, with a
little wisdom under my belt.</p>

<p>Since last week we've been continuing the pleasantifying
of mornings, and with one little hiccup yesterday, I think it's working.</p>
<p>To review, this is how it goes: we get up and have breakfast together,
then I go and shower and leave the children the following list:</p>
<ol>
<li>two trips to the kitchen</li>
<li>pack snack</li>
<li>get dressed</li>
<li>brush teeth</li>
<li>brush hair</li>
</ol>
<p>To which Delphine inevitably adds a sixth item: Play. I think
they're finally understanding that Play can only come after (and
if) every other thing is done.</p>
<p><a href="http://nurturestore.co.uk/">Cathy</a> suggested creating
a colourful chart listing the morning routine, but Delphine is
text-oriented and a list nerd like me, so the staid
to-do list format works for her. I write a new list every day, and
she solemnly X'es off the things she's finished. It works for both
girls, even though Cordelia doesn't read yet, because
Delphine's essentially in charge of Cordelia in the morning, and Cordelia
doesn't mind. (Your mileage may vary.)</p>
<p>Yesterday I didn't include "brush hair" on the list, and when I 
announced "we have to leave in five minutes" Delphine rashly 
concluded they had time to play because they were "almost done". 
Cordelia came downstairs with every intention of playing and
justly rebelled when I said I had to brush her hair first.
She dug her heels in and I lost my temper and hollered at them.
I'm not sure why I took it so badly—could be that I
didn't get enough sleep, or I was worried that I would miss
a 9:00 appointment.
Fortunately Delphine stepped up and was the grown-up. She 
brushed Cordelia's hair and her own, and helped us all get out
of the house in good time.</p>
<p>Today our morning went smooth as butter: I didn't leave anything
off the list, and the children didn't muck about. We arrived
at school in plenty of time, with no shouting. It probably
didn't hurt that the kids were in bed early last night.</p>
<p>I should add that one of the keys to this working is that
I studiously don't care what their snacks look like (apart from
that they have to contain fruit). Today Cordelia took a little
container with some pretzel sticks and a dried apricot—no
snack bag, no drink. It's certainly not how I would do it, but I
expect it will be good enough for her, plus she has the satisfaction
of having created and packed her own snack.</p>
<p>Another thing I cultivate a lack of interest in is what the children
wear. Today Cordelia wore a black dance leotard with teal leggings,
which might just be a little too gorgeous for kindergarten. Delphine
has been dressing herself sensibly (but with 
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/2005/1125/04-w-outfit.JPG">a certain 
flair</a>) 
since forever, and fortunately she's happy
to choose Cordelia's clothes too, on the days Cordelia's not 
interested.</p>
<p>So, for now, mornings are a success story. As the girls grow and the
dynamic between them changes, I guess our mornings will change too,
and of course the success of mornings will depend on how well-rested
we all are, but for now I'm happy that we have laid the groundwork
for a functional start to the day.</p>

<p>I'm not sure this is the post I want to post, but it's on my mind.</p>
<p>Today I did a positive parenting experiment. Normally Blake and I
nag and cajole 
the girls through their morning, until we're all angry at each other
and we end up rushing to school in a sweaty rush. Lousy
way to start the day, so I decided to Schäfer it up: I would
tell the girls what was expected of them and what I would do, and
then I would step back and let them take responsibility for their
morning routine.</p>
<p>They were forty minutes late for school.</p>
<p>Here's how it went down.
We ate breakfast together, and then I went upstairs to take a shower 
and dress,
with the following message: "You guys need to take your two trips [to
the kitchen with stuff from the table], pack your lunches and snacks
and get dressed. If you have time can you give Thomas his food and 
water?" At that point they had enough time to complete everything
if they got on with it.</p>
<p>While I was in the shower they fought. While I was getting dressed they
fought and then played. After I was dressed I came 
downstairs—the table was not cleared and they were both still 
in their pajamas.  I carried on without agitation or urgency. I finished
clearing the table while they played, them I folded laundry. At 8:30 I let them
know the first bell was ringing at school—they were
still in their pajamas, but at that point Delphine started to rush. She
asked for, and received, help packing her lunch, while Cordelia stayed
in her pajamas. Delphine tried to get Cordelia to hurry up, 
and she agreed to pack Cordelia's snack while she got dressed. Finally
we left the house at 9:05, and signed in at school at around 9:20.</p>
<p>I was calm on the outside but on the inside I was freaking out while
they played as if they hadn't a thing to do all 
day. It was a miracle of parental self-restraint. I didn't even 
nag on the way to school, I let being late speak for itself. (When
you say "I told you so" or "let this be a lesson to you" it's called
piggybacking and it turns a natural consequence into a punishment,
which just gets you caught up in a power struggle and demotivates
the child.) Being on time
for school is not my problem, it's theirs. My job is to provide 
them with the tools and information to get to school on time.</p>
<p>Tonight we're going to have a family meeting to talk about 
mornings. My suggestion will be to make a morning routine poster,
and I will let them know that a) I will only remind them of their
morning responsibilities once, b) I will not play with them in
the morning, and c) I will let them know what time it is every ten
minutes. Hopefully they will come up with some ideas of how to
stay focussed in the morning.</p>
<p>I hope tomorrow goes better. I know I'm supposed to be detached
and aloof, but the school expects the parents to "get" their children
to school on time, so I do feel responsible and guilty when they
are late. Also, I have a few morning meetings and appointments coming
up which I don't want to be late for. I'll have to review my 
parenting books and see what I'm supposed when my kids are making me
late. In the meantime I will repeat the following phrase: "It will
get worse before it gets better. It will get worse before it gets
better."</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What I Did Wrong</strong>: I sprung this new behaviour on them without
warning. As I said, normally we
nag and hustle and bother them all morning and I think that's where
they get their clues as to how late they are and what they should
be doing. Today I remained calm and I think the girls interpreted 
that to mean that we were on time, even though I told them in words
that we weren't. Actions really do speak louder.</p>
<p>Also, we were running a teeny bit behind right from the start. Not
behind enough to make us late, but behind enough that we needed to
be brisk. So I would say I'm responsible for about five minutes of that
forty. I would rather our mornings were leisurely but focussed, which
will mean I need to be more disciplined about getting up and fixing
breakfast on time.</p>
<p><strong>What I Did Right</strong>: I think otherwise I applied the principles of
positive parenting correctly. I remained kind yet firm, I didn't 
get into any power struggles, I told them what I <em>would</em> do rather 
than what they <em>should</em> do.</p>

    <div>
<p>For the last six years I've been reading parenting books. I've read
dozens of them, some good, some useless, but a handful stand out as
books I've reached for time and again when I had a question or
a problem, or just needed some reassuring company. These are 
the books I would buy (if I were rich) for 
every expecting mother I know. </p>
<h5>Start At The Very Beginning</h5>
<p>Well, not the very beginning—there are lots of books about
pregnancy and childbirth out there, but childbirth is such an
unpredictable and personal thing that you'd have to read a library's
worth of books just to learn the handful of things which will apply
to your situation. Your best bet is to find a good midwife and stay 
off the Internet.</p>
<p>Once the baby comes you'll want to feed it, and the best nursing
advice I found (in book form—again, a trustworthy advisor
is your best bet but unless you were clever enough to marry
 a lactation consultant you'll
need a source of midnight advice) is <em>Breastfeeding Made Simple: Seven
Natural Laws for Nursing Mothers</em> by Nancy Mohrbacher and Kathleen 
Kendall-Tackett. The title is an exaggeration, of course—no book
can make breastfeeding simple— but their advice is soothing, 
practical, and research-based.</p>
<p>After a while your baby will be ready for, as we call it, people
food, and the best introduction to the subject is <em>Better Baby Food:
Your Essential Guide to Nutrition, Feeding and Cooking for All
Babies and Toddlers</em> by Daina Kalnins and Joanne Saab. Published 
by Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children, this book introduces you
to the nuts (actually no nuts) and bolts of feeding babies and
small children, from nutrition advice to guidelines on when to 
introduce different foods. There are recipes for everything from
purees to delicious entrees the whole family
will enjoy. We love their hot and sour soup, and the chocolate
chip oatmeal cookies are divine. There is a good mixture of 
healthy meals and homemade treats, plain food and sophisticated
flavours. All the recipes are clearly written and easy to follow,
with common ingredients.</p>
<p>My only caveat with <em>Better Baby Food</em> is that it was published 
before the latest advice moved weaning age up to six months, so 
their baby food recipes are suggested for four months and up.</p>
<h5>Sleep, Gentle Sleep</h5>
<p>The best sleep advice around is to be found in Dr. Marc Weissbluth's 
<em>Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child</em>. Weissbluth is pragmatic,
respectful of your child's need to sleep (and yours) and insistent
on the importance of a good night's sleep. I wish the book were
better edited, as it is sometimes hard to slog through his academic
pontificating to get to the actual advice, but once you've found it
it's gold. People keep borrowing my copy.</p>
<h5>Dear God What Next?</h5>
<p>Children change all the time; no sooner do you think you've figured
your little one out then they become someone slightly different.
I have often thought to myself, sometimes dispairingly, "Is this
just a phase, or is this what she's <em>really like</em>?" The <em>Your 
N-Year-Old</em> series by Louise Bates Ames and Frances Lillian Ilg
can help answer that question. Each book comes with a subtitle which
is a teaser for what you can expect in that year of your child's
life; your three-year-old is "Friend or Enemy", your four-year-old
is, alarmingly, "Wild and Wonderful, but then you're rewarded with a 
"Sunny and Serene" five-year-old. </p>
<p>These books have
given me perspective on what my children are going
through developmentally and what I can expect from them, both
good and bad. Now, when Cordelia throws a giant fit because I
cut her toast the wrong way, I can just wait it out with a 
shrug—"She's four"—rather than dispairing that I've
borne a drama queen and she'll always be like this. These books make it
possible to untangle the influences of developmental stage from
my children's real personalities.</p>
<h5>Discipline</h5>
<p>No less than four books (plus two) on this topic. They all cover 
about the same territory but in slightly different ways, so I suppose you
could pick your favourite and just read that, but I find it's helpful to
reinforce this stuff periodically, and this way you don't have to do
it by rereading the same book over and over.</p>
<p><em>Kids Are Worth It</em> by Barbara Coloroso, <em>Positive Discipline</em> 
by Dr. Jane Nelsen, <em>Unconditional Parenting</em> by
Alfie Kohn, and <em>Breaking The Good Mom Myth</em> by Alyson Schäfer are
all books about positive parenting, or unconditional parenting, or
democratic parenting, or Adlerian parenting, which are 
variations on a philosophy of parenting which regards children
as full and equal members of the family with equal rights to respect
and dignity. It's the style of parenting I have chosen because it
seems most right and effective to me, and the books listed are all excellent
guides to parenting in that style. </p>
<p><em>How To Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk</em> by
Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish is a light but effective guide to talking
to your kids (rather than at them). This book is thick with specific
ideas and techniques to help you communicate with your kids. The
same authors wrote <em>Siblings Without Rivalry</em>, which teaches how to
manage siblings, with plenty of examples, cartoons and summaries.</p>
<h5>Reading</h5>
<p>In between feeding, disciplining and putting your children to sleep
you might want to spend some time with them, and a great way to do that
is in the company of books. <em>Babies Need Books: Sharing the Joy of
Books with Children from Birth to Six</em> by Dorothy Butler is an
impassioned appeal to parents to read early and often. Butler tells
us not only why and how we should read, but what, with long lists of
great books for every stage from birth to six.</p>
<h4>Perspective</h4>
<p>In the thick of all this advice you'll want some perspective. Having
a second child is a great way to get perspective, as well as a good dose
of humility (if you thought your child's awesomeness was to your 
credit) or absolution (if you thought your child's horribleness was
your fault). If you're not ready for another child, though, these books
will put your parenting—and all the advice you're getting—into
its proper context.</p>
<p>The amply sub-titled <em>The Boy Who Was Raised As A Dog: And Other 
Stories from a Child Psychiatrist's Notebook: What Traumatized 
Children Can Teach Us About Loss, Love and Healing</em> by Bruce
Perry and Maia Szalavitz is a collection of case studies of children
who have gone though horrible trauma—abuse, cults, 
neglect—and what they can teach us about childhood
development and resiliency. This book will help you because no
matter what you're doing "wrong" you can't do as much harm to your
child as has been done to these children, and because despite such
miserable childhoods many of these kids go on to be normal,
functioning adults.</p>
<p><em>Perfect Parents: Baby-care Advice Past and Present</em> by Christina Hardyment
is an overview of the crazy, yet earnest, advice given to parents 
(usually mothers) over the last hundred and fifty years. Parents have
been admonished on topics from hugging (bad) to breastfeeding (bad)
to warm baths (bad), and some of the advice will leave you open-mouthed.
Following the advice is almost always presented as vital to the fabric of 
society, and yet somehow, civilization has soldiered on
despite the failings of mothers everywhere.</p>
<p><em>How Not To Be The Perfect Mother</em> by Libby Purves is a memoir 
written by Purves while she was, as she puts it, at the
"coalface of practical early motherhood". Funny and pragmatic, Purves
offers advice and reassurance without judgement. "A good hungry dog
mooching around the high chair helps."</p>
<p>My children are six and four, and I expect I have at least ten years 
of parenting books ahead of me, so I suppose this list will change, 
but I've been through two babyhoods and two toddlerhoods and am
now firmly in the realm of parenting children. Books have been a
terrific help and comfort to me through this journey, and I hope this list
can help other parents find their path.</p>

    <div>
<p><a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/everythingelse/thoseWomen.html">Back in
November</a> I talked about those women who do a million and one 
things—have a career, have a nice house, do charity work, volunteer
 at school—and how I'm going to be more like them. So far
it's going pretty well—I helped with a fundraiser at school,
I'm chair of a somewhat underachieving Eco-committee (part of the problem
being that whenever we think of something eco to do it turns out the
school is already doing it), and so far my children haven't starved
to death or sickened due to the filthy state of the house. One thing
did falter: I missed a few notes in
the Christmas concert because I wasn't at the dress rehearsal.
Lesson learned.</p>
<p>But I digress. The reason I bring this up is that I realized that
this ambition, to Do Lots of Things, is a subset of a bigger ambition
which I have just put into words: Be More Awesome.</p>
<p>As I have discussed before, I see myself as a veritable well of
unfulfilled potential. Sure, I have a rather lame math degree 
and two lovely children, but other people my age are running
for city councillor and writing books and,well, being awesome. I want
at least a little piece of that.</p>
<p>Let me digress again for a moment. The school is getting a second 
kindergarten playground, and the eco-committee wants it to be
a natural playground, one of those jobbies with logs and rocks
to play on instead of metal and plastic playstructures. Great idea, 
very eco. We (mostly I) came up with this idea ages ago, but I
wasn't sure where to start, who to talk to, how to broach the 
subject. So I didn't do anything.</p>
<p>And then last week I busted up my back (You know why? Because in
my last post I was all "I haven't hurt my back for over a year!"
Stupid.) and I was stuck on the couch all week. Rather than
be completely useless I did some research on natural playgrounds
and then I emailed the principal. I was all, "The eco-committee
is exploring the idea of a natural playground for the new 
kindergarten playground", and I went on to briefly describe a
natural playground, and explain why we (I) thought it would be
a good idea. I cc'd the vice-principal, our trustee, and the rest
of the committee, and hit send. </p>
<p>Three minutes later the 
trustee replied saying he would be happy to attend a meeting
about this proposal. Proposal! It was just an idea, a whim!
But by writing it down and sending it to some people,
it became a proposal. Thirty minutes later the 
principal responded with a five-paragraph email, cc'd
to about a billion more people, saying
that they had considered a natural playground, we should meet
soon and what was my thinking? We're meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>That's it. That's all it took: an idea, some Googling and a
judiciously cc'd email, and now we have a proposal and a meeting.
Obviously I'm going to have to prepare for the meeting, and there
will be other jobs coming down the pipeline, but all it took
to get the ball rolling was one email message.</p>
<p>What I have learned from this is that the path to awesomeness is
paved with tiny baby steps. This a truth neither profound 
nor abstruse, but it has been a long time coming to me.  I 
don't like to act on things unless I <em>know</em> how they're going to
turn out. And not just the first step, I like to know what's
going to happen four or five steps down the line. I like to think things
through and anticipate problems, and prepare for them.  This is a
wonderful trait if you're going camping, or taking two small people
downtown, or going on vacation, but it has its limits.
When I'm contemplating something complicated or new, or that
involves other people, I can can always think of nine or ten 
ways stuff could go horribly wrong. Thus, paralysis. Inaction. Failure
to be awesome.</p>
<p>A while ago I read a book called <em>Feel the Fear... And Do It 
Anyway</em> by Susan Jeffers and as you can see from 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/books/_2008/non-fiction.html#fear">my
discussion of it</a>, a) this blog post is well overdue and b) I am
a broken record. The good news is that I've taken the lessons I learned
from the book on board—the ideas that were new to me back in
2008 are a comfortable part of my daily coping repertoire now. So,
odd as it seems, these realizations, that I am scared to act if I don't
know I will succeed, and that it only takes a small step to start getting
things done, actually represent progress in my quest to be more awesome.</p>

</div>
    </header><div class="p-summary entry-summary">
    <div>
<p>I got a great email newsletter from David Allen (of 
Getting Things Done fame) about taking stock of the
year's accomplishments and completions. He included a
list of categories to focus on, which I am going to
use to consider how 2009 was for me and what I'm going
to change in 2010.</p>
<h5>Physical</h5>
<p>After a c-section in 2003, another in 2005 and gallbladder
removal in 2007, 2009 was refreshingly free of major or 
minor surgery. I don't think I had a single episode of major
back pain, either, so maybe I have finally figured out how
to deal with that (mainly stretching, and strategic use of
ab muscles). I did some running after school started in September, 
but a bout of H1N1 in November sapped my motivation and I haven't 
run since.</p>
<p>I recently went to the doctor for my irregularly scheduled annual checkup
and everything checked up fine, but I have gained twenty pounds I 
wasn't entirely expecting. (I don't weigh myself at home so the 
pounds have lots of time to creep on between doctor visits.)
I will be addressing that situation in
the new year, along with everyone else in North America. I've 
been very self-indulgent with my eating habits lately—I
need to be more sensible about that, and I'm going to switch
from running to walking in the hopes that I can slip it into my
daily routine easier. I also think that doing yoga regularly
would cure most of my mechanical problems.</p>
<h5>Emotional</h5>
<p>I have to admit this has been a difficult year for me,
emotionally. I have been pretty unhappy about a couple of
things—doing all the housework myself, for 
example—and have felt almost entirely alone with
that unhappiness. Blake and
I are rubbish at confrontation so I tend to never try and
resolve problems with him. And they fester. As if that's not bad enough, I
don't have an extra-marital emotional support system to listen 
and offer support and suggestions. I used to have
my brother, then I had Sascha and my BF-as-it-turns-out-not-F
Janet. My brother and Sascha got lives and Janet dumped me,
and then Delphine was born, and I guess I haven't had any
real emo needs since then, until this year. This year has been
very emo but I've mainly dealt with it on my own, mostly in
the basement while folding laundry. That sucks. Kat is a 
good ear, but I can't drop everything and cry on the phone
to her whenever I'm unhappy. The laundry needs folding and
she has a job.</p>
<p>Obviously in 2010 I have to do that a little better. What
do I do? Make a new friend? One without a job or any children?
Get a therapist? Start a private journal? Go to a marriage
counsellor? I will have to figure something out.</p>
<h5>Mental</h5>
<p>Mentally I think I have held my ground this year. As I mentioned
in my book blog, this year hasn't been terrifically intellectually
rigorous, but I read a few thinky books and I've been keeping up
with my Walruses and New Scientists. I'm happy and excited with
my decision to pursue writing as a career. I love to read and
think and write, and if I can possibly make some kind of money at
it that would be awesome.</p>
<p>Next year, obviously, I have to kick the writing into  a
higher gear. It's very hard to get anything done in the two hours
that Cordelia is at school, so I have to figure out how to focus my efforts
in that time (less twitting and housework, more actual writing).
I have both girls on a list for daycare starting in September, but
of course paying for daycare demands that I earn an income. This
is more terrifying to me than perhaps it should be.</p>
<h5>Spiritual</h5>
<p>I think I'm in the same place spiritually that I was a year ago.
I don't think about it much.  I don't believe in the 
supernatural but I derive a feeling of
wonder from the immensity of the universe, from the magical
unlikeliness of our existence, from my children. I try to be
good. In 2010, more of the same.</p>
<h5>Financial</h5>
<p>We paid off our line of credit! Of course, Blake was on 
contract and he didn't pay taxes all year, so come April we may
be in debt again, but for now we are debt-free. Hopefully a year
from now we will be debt-free for sure.</p>
<h5>Family</h5>
<p>My family is awesome. The girls are going through an utterly
charming patch, and I'm happy with our parenting. I haven't
yelled in ages! Next year, I hope that will continue. Five
and seven are both supposed to be pretty charming ages, so that
looks good.</p>
<p>Further afield, I would like to be closer to my brother. He
just moved in with a girl who I know next to nothing about,
and I have no idea what's going on with him generally. I should
also call my mother more often. So should you, probably.</p>
<h5>Community Service</h5>
<p>Before this year I wouldn't have had a lot to say in this category,
but this year I did a ton of work for my kids' school, and did
it ever open my eyes to the amount of free labour the school boards
of Canada get from parents. I worked in the library, volunteered
in the classroom, helped run a craft room for a fundraiser, went
on a field trip, was class parent for Delphine's class, and signed 
up to head the Eco-committee.</p>
<p>This year I hope to actually <em>do</em> something as head of the Eco-committee,
and I'm going to try and pursuade our School Council to donate some
money to a school without so many deep-pocketed parents. I suppose
I'll be roped into running the craft room again next Christmas, too.</p>
<h5>Fun / creativity / recreation</h5>
<p>You know, I've been thinking about fun lately, specifically in the
context of play. The children play most of the time and work hardly
at all—Delphine works a little bit at school, and she has
a couple of jobs at home, but most of her time is free time.
Cordelia is four—she plays at school and she plays at home,
and her only job is feeding the cat. </p>
<p>But when do I play? On the one hand I'm in the very lucky position
of rarely having to do something which I'm not intrinsically motivated
to do. I look after the children because I love them, I take care
of the house because I want my house to be taken care of. I
read and write because I love to do so, I have fun volunteering
for the school. There is almost nothing I do that's pure drudgery.
And a lot of what I do is pure fun: most of my reading, choir,
my friendships, and watching TV are all things I do for myself.</p>
<p>In 2010 I would like to read more, and keep singing and seeing
my friends. I'm even happy with the amount of TV I watch, or
rather with the quality of TV I watch. I should try and
use my time more mindfully, so I don't fritter it away. I have
too much fun stuff to do to spend time doing things which are merely
diverting.</p>
<p>That's that. It's 12:21 am on January 1. I hope everyone
has a wonderful year in 2010!</p>
<p>(By the way, you can subscribe to David Allen's Productive
Living newsletter <a href="http://www.davidco.com/productive_living.php">here</a>.
I've only received one, so I don't know how good they generally
are, but since I used the latest one to inspire this post
I figure I should at least point you to the source. I
do use the Getting Things Done system and find it very effective
and comprehensive.)</p>

<p>Another year, another giant stack of books. Here's how it all boiled
down in ought-nine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Total books read: 66</li>
<li>Adult Novels: 16, of which six mysteries, and six for the book club.</li>
<li>Young Adult Novels: 4, two of which by Kit Pearson</li>
<li>Non-Fiction: 42, of which:<ul>
<li>9 books about writing;</li>
<li>6 books about parenting;</li>
<li>16 how-to and self-help (or psychology) books;</li>
<li>leaving 11 others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Memoir: 5, three by Bill Bryson</li>
<li>CanCon: 12<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I felt like I wasn't reading much this year, and I was right. Further, it
wasn't my most profoundly intellectual of reading years. I only
read four adult non-mystery novels of my own accord (the rest were for
the book club). I read
a bunch of non-fiction books, but plenty of them were "how to decorate" or 
"how to garden"-type books. </p>
<p>Interesting that I read three more books about writing than I did about
parenting. I guess I'm getting pretty confident about the latter, but 
still petrified to take the plunge into the former.</p>
<p>Here are some standout books, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Pictures of Perfection</em> by Reginald Hill is a beautifully written
mystery.</li>
<li>
<em>A Handful of Time</em> and <em>A Perfect, Gentle Knight</em> by Kit Pearson
both made me cry, as did</li>
<li>
<em>Elijah of Buxton</em> by Christopher Paul Curtis</li>
<li>
<em>Free-Range Kids</em> by Lenore Skenazy and <em>Unconditional Parenting</em> by 
Alfie Kohn pushed me to raise my parenting game</li>
<li>
<em>Dead Men Do Tell Tales</em> by William R. Maples and Michael Browning
was surprisingly profound and yet also provided me with lots of
gross anecdotes for cocktail parties.</li>
<li>I called <em>Everyday Survival</em> by Laurence Gonzales as one the best
of the year back in January when I read it, and I was right. It's
astonishing in its depth and breadth, and the way Gonzales brings
it all together is breathtaking. In fact, I can hardly believe it
was so good—I'm going to have to read it again and see.</li>
<li>And a special mention to <em>Getting Started As A Freelance Writer</em> 
by Robert Bly for planting the seed of the idea that I might be
able to earn a living at this thing I do for fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next year I'm going to try and clear out at least half of the 
two feet of my to-be-read shelf before the end of May. I'm going
to try and read more novels, and I'm going to strive, as always,
to be a more attentive and thoughtful reader.</p>

<p>A while ago I read <strong><em>The Ten Year Nap</em></strong> <strong>by Meg Wolitzer</strong>, 
for book club, but I forgot to write it down and therefore
didn't blog about it at the time.  It's 
about a handful of New York mothers who variously
work, don't work, volunteer, don't volunteer, bake, don't bake,
have great marriages or disappointing ones. It's about the
choices women make about work and life, and about how you
sometimes find you've made life-changing choices without
really knowing it at the time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately nothing happens in the first 92 pages of
this book. There are chapters and chapters and chapters 
of character development and backstory until you wish
you could step into the book with a handgun just to make
something happen. Finally something happens, there's a couple
of chapters of action, and the book ends. It's all a
bit boring and I probably wouldn't have finished it, if
it weren't for the book club. Ironically I didn't 
end up going to the book club meeting, but I bet it
was a good one. We always have more fun talking about
books we didn't like, and despite the slowness of the
story, this book provided plenty of discussion fodder for
a group of urban mothers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Heat Wave</em></strong> is a book "by" <strong>Richard Castle</strong>, the fictional
protagonist of the TV series <em>Castle</em>. He's a well-connected
mystery writer, played by Nathan Fillion, who shadows a sexy 
New York cop (Stana Katic) for research.
The book is about a magazine writer who shadows a sexy New York
cop for research. It was very disconcerting to read a book
written by a fictional character, about a second-order 
fictional character who was clearly based on the first-order
fictional character (who in turn is played by an actor who I follow
on Twitter, providing yet another layer of reality/unreality
confoundment). But besides that it was a clever and
funny mystery very much in keeping with the TV show. </p>
<p>Another torturous read courtesy of the book club (it's
been a bad year): <strong><em>Autobiography 
of Santa Claus</em></strong> <strong>by Jeff Guinn</strong> is a history of Santa Claus
written as an autobiography, from the character's origins
as a child named Nicolas who would be a bishop and later a saint,
all the way to the portly elf we know today. Along the way
Guinn explains how Santa manages to make all the toys and get
all the way around the world so fast. He might explain some
other stuff, but I stopped reading around the time Santa
Claus convinced Queen Isabella to sponsor Christopher 
Columbus's search for a better route to India. The book is
full of such Forrest Gumpian connections. The funny thing
is, all the people that old St Nick befriends, including King
Arthur, and Attila the Hun, share the same 
early-21st century belief system as Santa (and, I imagine,
most of the readers of this book). </p>
<p>I love Christmas and I love Santa Claus—well, I don't mind
him—but this book is simple-minded glurge. I would enjoy
a real history of Santa Claus: how his story has changed
throughout history, and what the changes mean in the context of
their time. This is not that book.</p>
