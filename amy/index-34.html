<p>As summer draws to an end the girls and I are trying to squeeze the last of
the fun out of the season. One of the last things on the list we came up with
at the beginning of the year was to go to the Harbourfront, and that is
what we did today.</p>
<p>As usual we got off to a late start—between brushing hair and applying
sunblock and looking for Playmobil horses and TTC tokens we didn't 
leave the house until around ten. When we got down to the Harbourfront
the first order of business (after saying goodbye to the crowds of people
headed for the Ex) was to find money. Unfortunately RBC has a lock
on Queen's Quay Terminal, so we wandered westward searching for a TD
bank machine. On the way we saw: a camp "canoeing" (more being
pushed about) on Natrel pond; Delphine's canoe camp (she showed us the
giant canoe they all went out to Centre Island in); the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_Bridge,_Toronto">Amsterdam
Bridge</a>; the 
<a href="http://www.torontopedia.ca/Spadina_Wave_Deck">Spadina wave deck</a>; 
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTO_Park">HtO Park</a>. HtO Park is basically a giant
sandbox with big metal umbrellas and Muskoka chairs—we couldn't
decide if it was cool or lame, but Delphine liked the shower/footbath.</p>
<p>At that point it was apparent that we wouldn't find a TD bank machine anywhere,
so we headed back to Queen's Quay Terminal (via the 
<a href="http://www.landezine.com/?p=993">Simcoe wave deck</a>) where I
paid $1.50 for the privilege of taking money out of an RBC machine.</p>
<p>Next on the itinerary was to buy tickets for a boat ride. We went with
Mariposa Boat Cruises because they were the first kiosk we came to, and
Cordelia rode for free. It was 12:00 so I bought tickets for the 1:30 ride
to give us time to get lunch. After pondering Il Fornello and an 
Irish pub, we decided to economize, and had chicken fingers, fish and
chips, and a tuna sandwich at a grill-type place. Then back to Queen's Quay
Terminal where we got an ice cream cone just in time to take it on the
boat.</p>
<p>We rode on the 
<a href="http://www.mariposacruises.com/our-fleet-oriole.php">Oriole</a>
(not quite as glamourous, in the harsh light of day, as they make it sound)
and made ourselves at home on the lower deck, with only the bartender
for company. I love the harbourfront boat tours—you get to go around
the island lagoon, see the yachts, the bird sanctuary, the 
<a href="http://www.toronto.ca/parks/island/lighthouse.htm">Gibraltar Point
Lighthouse</a>, and of course the city from the other side. The
girls loved it too, although Delphine had trouble keeping up with the
tour guide's descriptions of buildings: "Between the two white buildings
you'll see a tall gold building..." "Which one is it, Mama? I can't see it."
By the time I described it again, of course, it was out of sight. Cordelia
probably just couldn't make sense of it at all and was enjoying the ride
on her own terms. It's good to be four.</p>
<p>A few things bothered me about the information given out in the
tour. They talked about the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto-Dominion_Centre">TD Centre</a> 
but they didn't mention it
was designed by Mies van der Rohe; they talked about 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Canadian_Place">First Canadian
Place</a> but they didn't mention it by name (they called it the Bank of 
Montreal building) and they didn't say why it has scaffolding at the top; they
called Canada geese "Canadian geese" which is a neologism which drives
me crazy; and finally (is that all?!) they said the CN in CN Tower stands
for "Canada's National". Which is just stupid, although according to
this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CN_Tower">Wikipedia page</a> not
entirely wrong.</p>
<p>After the tour we visited what Delphine calls the Lemming Ball, for reasons
I will leave to her to explain when she has a blog. It's a giant, hollow
cement sphere which you can walk into through a wooden ramp. It is
surprisingly underdocumented on the Internet (or else I am searching wrong)
and you'd have to see it to really understand. The girls thought it was
really cool; I was too busy Twittering about two old people sitting on
a nearby bench making out like teenagers.</p>
<p>Next we charged over to Yonge Street (in the hot hot sun) in search 
of the Royal York Hotel. Those
of you who are smarter than me will be saying, "Hey, isn't the Royal
York on Bay Street?" As it turns out, it is, so we charged over to
Yonge Street, walked under the Gardiner (boo, hiss) and then (once
I realized my mistake) charged
back west on Front Street until we finally reached the elegantly
air conditioned Royal York. I thought the girls would be impressed
by the shiny old-school, dimly lit, brass-and-Persian-carpets luxury
of it, and so they were. They also immediately quieted down and behaved
like princesses as soon as we got inside; to the manner born, they are.</p>
<p>We found a fancy hotel restroom and took our time freshening up, and 
then I impulsively suggested that we go to 
<a href="http://www.epicrestaurant.ca/">Epic</a> for drinks. The
maitre d' was busy on the phone helping someone plan his (or her) proposal
dinner, so we found ourselves a table and ordered lemonade for Cordelia,
a Shirley Temple for Delphine and iced tea for me. (That's "drinks" when
you travel with a four-year-old and a seven-year-old.) The drinks came with
an elegant silver bowl of not-entirely-elegant snack mix: beer nuts, 
wasabi peas, cheese crackers, and sesame chips. It was delightfully
refreshing, all the more so because for some reason they only charged
us for my drink. I guess it pays to be really cute.</p>
<p>On the way home we intersected with about a million cranky TDSB teachers
TTCing home from 
<a href="http://www.tdsb.on.ca/microsites/believe_it//about.asp">Spence-a-palooza</a> with their unwanted green tote bags. It's interesting to see how
many teachers live in our neighbourhood—there were at least four
on our bus alone.</p>
<p>(I may have inadvertently insulted our French/gym teacher within his
earshot. I was talking to an acquaintance, also a teacher, and saying I
wished we had a proper gym teacher at our school; the kids either get
a non-gym teacher who happens to be free at the right time, or they
get M. Landry who is half gym, half French, but his heart is really in 
the French classroom. However, what I actually said
was "M. Landry is just an angry French teacher", which is, I believe,
an accurate characterization. As I said it a guy sitting nearby kind
of smirked, and when he got off the bus at our stop he was talking
to his friend in a French accent. So, oops, maybe.)</p>
<p>Then we were home and I sent the children off to play at a neighbour's
house while I took a few minutes to relax. It was a great day—I
love exploring the city with my kids, they are such good company. (Even
when they pick and snipe at each other all day as they have been lately.)</p>
<p>Tomorrow they're going for back-to-school haircuts and then we'll hit
the library and the park, if it isn't raining.</p>

<p>It doesn't seem to matter how much other stuff I have going on, I always
have time to read. Don't have time to blog, don't have time to work, 
definitely don't have time to houseclean—still have time to
read.</p>
<p><strong><em>Science, Sense and Nonsense</em></strong> <strong>by Joe Schwarcz</strong> is a collection of
commentaries on chemistry in everyday life, with a side of fraud-spotting
advice. The book covers antioxidants, trans fats, historical alternatives 
to rubber, and a wealth of other topics serious and amusing.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Devil's Arithmetic</em></strong> <strong>by Jane Yolen</strong> is a young adult book
about a modern girl who, bored with her family Seder, is transported back
in time to 1941 Poland. I guess maybe the only thing worse than being a
Jew in Poland in 1941 is being a Jew in Poland in 1941 who knows the future.
She and her entire village are sent to a concentration camp where they
fight to survive and to retain their humanity. This book has won a heap
of awards (and I just found out it was made into a movie with Kirsten
Dunst and Brittany Murphy) and it is a wonderful story about the importance
of remembering.</p>
<p>I read <strong><em>The Root Cellar</em></strong> <strong>by Janet Lunn</strong> out loud to Delphine.
It's another time travel book, about a girl who is left alone when
her grandmother dies. She is packed off to live with relatives in rural
Ontario and is lonely and miserable until she discovers that the 
root cellar takes her back in time to the 1860s, where she makes friends
and feels more at home than in the present. Her twin challenges are to
track down a friend who doesn't return from the American civil war (in
the past) and to find a place for herself in her new family (in the
present). I loved this book when
I was a child, and Delphine liked it this time around, as did I.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shakespeare: The World as a Stage</em></strong> <strong>by Bill Bryson</strong> is a
short biography of Shakespeare—short because we don't really know
much about the playwright. In addition to what little we do know, 
Bryson covers disproved (or unlikely)
theories and myths. As always, readable and informative.</p>
<p><strong><em>The History of Love</em></strong> <strong>by Nicole Krauss</strong> was a book club book.
It's about old man who feels like he is disappearing; his long-lost
son, a famous novelist; a teenage girl named Alma whose mother is
translating a book which turns out was written by... well, you'll have
to read it yourself. It's one of those books where the stories go
along in parallel and you have to try and figure out how they're connected
before the end when the author ties everything together with a big
bow. It was a lovely book; I enjoyed reading it, although in book
club we decided you have to read it in big chunks or you'll get 
too confused.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Unfinished Angel</em></strong> <strong>by Sharon Creech</strong> is a... young adult?
Middle grade? I never know—although I'll have to figure it out pretty
soon because I'm helping a friend with her middle-grade novel this fall—
Anyway, it's a book about an angel whose quiet life in a tower is 
interrupted by the arrival of a girl who changes everything in the
village. The book is written in the childlike voice of the angel, which
sounds a little cringe-y, but Sharon Creech is a phenomenal writer and
she makes it work. This is only a short book and it goes quickly, but 
it's well worth reading.</p>

<p>OMG, look at this! I was going to write a book blog post and
here I find this half-finished book blog post. So I'm just going to
finish this up and post it, and then I will work on blogging the eighteen
thousand books I've read since I wrote this.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><em>Twelve Books That Changed the World</em></strong> <strong>by Melvyn Bragg</strong> is
a book that doesn't need much introduction. I believe it's a
tie-in book to a TV series, the kind of TV series that could
only be produced in England. The books range from the
St James Bible to Mary Woolstonecraft's <em>A Vindication of the 
Rights of Woman</em> and, curiously, <em>Rules of Association
Football</em>. Each book is given its place in history, and as
such this book is an excellent cheat sheet for someone whose
education in history is lacking.</p>
<p><strong><em>Further Under the Duvet</em></strong> <strong>by Marian Keyes</strong> was recommended
to me by someone on Twitter (I think it was 
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/flossieteacake">FlossieTeacake</a>)
after a discussion of villa-itis, or the fear that you are going
to run out of bread while staying at a French villa. The book
is a collection of essays and short stories. Keyes is an Irish
writer with the most extraordinary Cinderalla story of going
from abject alcoholism to fame and riches as a writer. The story
is told in the book, along with essays on the joy of writing
a makeup column (free samples!), air-guitar championships, shopping
and plenty of chocolate. Funny and sweet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Positive Discipline</em></strong> <strong>by Dr. Jane Nelsen</strong> is yet
another positive/democratic/whatever parenting book. I don't know
why I keep reading them, since I more-or-less know what I'm doing
by now, but it's good to be reminded, and I do pick up different
ideas from the various books. This particular book reminded me
of the importance of family meetings, and reassured me that some
problems (namely chores) will have to be revisited at regular
intervals but are still worth handling democratically. I wouldn't
call this my favourite democratic parenting book—it's just
not funny enough. But it's worth a look if you need a refresher
(or an introduction to positive parenting) or if you want a new
angle.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Gargoyle</em></strong> <strong>by Andrew Davidson</strong> is our first book club book
of the year, and already this year's book club selection is looking better
than last year's. <em>The Gargoyle</em> is about a man who gets terribly
burned in a car crash, then meets a mysterious woman with a
bizarre past while he's recovering. It's about love and redemption
and all that good stuff, with a big dose of history. It's beautifully
written and I didn't want it to end.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right</em></strong> <strong>by Atul Gawande</strong>.
I have long been a fan of the checklist. I like to-do lists to keep
my days focused, I like lists of things to take places, I like
to record our daily routines in list form so nothing is forgotten.
This book is the validation for my checklist habit: Gawande writes
about how checklists can improve the outcome of extremely complex
projects, such as construction projects, and surgeries. Checklists
are already in use in construction and aviation, and the book centres
on Gawande and his team's attempt to create a checklist to reduce
the number of fatalities as a result of surgeries. It's not a smooth
path, but along the way we learn the kinds of checklists (DO-CONFIRM
and READ-DO), what makes a good checklist (not too much information,
easy to read), what makes a bad checklist (too long), and the
mind-boggling difference that a checklist can make in a process that
everyone involved feels is already going pretty well. (Gawande
uses his own checklist, and at first he thought it wouldn't make
much difference to <em>his</em> outcomes. As it turns out, not a week
goes by that the checklist doesn't catch something he would have
missed, and it has even saved at least one life on his watch).</p>
<p>As usual, Gawande is engaging and convincing. This was a great
read as well as a confirmation (and refinement) of my love for
checklists.</p>

<p>Blake and I went for a bike ride today while the girls were out swimming
with Baba and Zaida. I didn't really want to go, but Blake does so love
to ride his bike, and I don't mind biking. So off we went, and went up
some steepish hills and down a slightly scary one, found some nice nature
to bring Delphine to, and lost contact with my butt. And that was, as
they say, all well and good, but the interesting thing happened later.</p>
<p>I felt great.</p>
<p>My back didn't hurt, my foot didn't hurt (I've had plantar fasciitis for,
like, months), and I had enough energy to run up and down the sidewalk
flying a kite with Cordelia. I didn't realize how bad I'd been feeling lately
until I stopped feeling bad, and clearly part of the problem is the
utter lack of aerobic exercise I've been doing lately. I'm not exactly
sure what I'm going to do about that...</p>
<hr>
<p>Cordelia and I fought today. Not the screamy angry kind of fighting,
but silly punching kicking fighting. She was hitting me as hard as
she could, and of course I was just play hitting. It's never come 
up before, so I have no idea of the etiquette of playfighting. I
suppose it's not done to playfight at all any more, but she's just
so cute when she snarls at me with her perfectly straight tiny
teeth, and thumps me with her tiny ineffectual fists. It's like
being menaced by a chinchilla.</p>
<hr>
<p>We watched Prince of Egypt today, admittedly a week late for Passover.
I had forgotten how great that movie is. We bought it, so we can watch
it as often as we like. Every Passover! We don't do anything else
for Passover, apart from eat a lot at Baba's house, so why not 
create our own traditions?</p>

<p>I used to have a blog here, but lately I've been busy with
this paying job thing and haven't been blogging much. I have
about eighteen million books to blog about, and everything
else. This is going to be the everything else post.</p>
<h5>Delphine</h5>
<p>Delphine is nearly seven and she's become all happy and patient and
agreeable. Well, not <em>all</em>, but more than before. She sometimes
doesn't respond when Cordelia tries to fight with her; she sometimes goes
along with me when I ask her to do stuff she doesn't want to;
she is usually happy after school and she seldom complains about
her day. She's no Pollyanna, but she's not quite as emo and 
gloomy as she has been through most of the last year.</p>
<p>Delphine had her first piano lesson last Saturday. Piano lessons
now are so much cooler than when I started playing: instead of
starting with "this is a staff and this is a quarter note" it
starts with "these are your fingers and this is the keyboard"
and you plunk away, and notation is introduced as needed and no
sooner. </p>
<p>So Delphine loves piano. She couldn't wait to get home to practice,
and she has practiced every day this week.</p>
<h5>Cordelia</h5>
<p>Cordelia is still happy, sweet Cordelia. She tells me she loves me 
eighteen million times a day and she does little dances. She loves her
friends, too—she and Anna won't go into the kindergarten 
playground without the other.</p>
<p>I wonder, sometimes, if Cordelia's always going to be the sweet, frivolous
contrast to Delphine's darker personality. No, that's not quite right.
What I wonder is how Cordelia's bubbliness will make the transition
to adulthood. Where is she going to get that gravity that surely
adulthood demands?</p>
<p>For now it seems like along with gloominess, Delphine
also has a lock on scepticism, bookishness, and intellectualism 
(inasmuch as a six-year-old can be intellectual). Cordelia's only
"things" are that she runs really fast (and a lot) and sings
well. I guess I worry that Delphine's going to be "the clever
one", leaving some other identity for Cordelia. I suppose even if
she isn't "the clever one" she'll still be clever and she can
always leverage that in whatever she ends up doing with herself.</p>
<p>Anyway, there's nothing so sure as that they'll be what they'll
be and I have much less control over what they'll be than I'd
like to think.</p>
<h5>Me</h5>
<p>As for me, I have got myself a paying job. I'm copyediting and
laying out a non-fiction book for self-publishing. A while
ago I said that I didn't think copyediting would be a great
job for me because it's so picky-picky; as it turns out it's
a lot more fun than I thought it would be. I do love to proofread
things, and even the totally anal stuff is kind of cool. I like
knowing what kind of dash to use (even if I don't always bother
to use the right one) and whether "BCE" has periods or not. And
the meticulousness you need to employ to keep track of the 
style decisions you've made is right up my list-making alley.</p>
<p>I do need to reread Strunk and White, and some other writing books,
just to clarify what makes good writing good, and I feel like
I should put my hands on some style guides. (I wonder if people buy
those on paper or just, I dunno, subscribe to them online or something.)</p>
<p>This working gig is going to have to get a lot more real in
September. I signed Cordelia up for daycare when she was just over a
year old, and as it turns out she got in. She starts in September
at the daycare at the school. I won't have Delphine in daycare
("It's not FAIR!") but I will send her to school with a lunch, so
my work day will be from 9:00 until 3:00. My plan, such that it is,
is to work a twenty-hour week, leaving me ten hours a week for such
frivolity as housework, exercise, reading and getting my nails done.
Maybe I'll skip the nails and read more.</p>
<p>I'm reading a rather intense (but very useful) book about 
starting a home-based
writing business. The author is quite intent on my making a business
plan, planning further education, budgeting, marketing, and all
that sensible, grown-up stuff. I almost feel like I can't waste
my time doing that stuff when I could be doing billable work—kind
of like the kid who runs his bike all the way to school because he
doesn't have time to get on. I'm also resisting doing all that
business stuff because somehow I can't take myself that seriously
as a professional freelance writer and copyeditor. Clearly I'm 
going to have to get over that, but fortunately I have a few months
to do it.</p>

<p>I've been thinking I should really take some driving lessons to
get over my fear of scary big city driving. Since I already have
a driver's license, I don't need actual in-class
lessons, I only need a few hours in one of those cars with the extra
set of brakes, so I emailed a couple of driving schools to see if I could
do that. Here is what I received in response from AllWheels Drivers:</p>
<blockquote>
were do you live and do you have ontario G1 licence.<br>
IF YOU ONLY HAVE SASK. licence you will have to get your G1 licence inder take driviong lessons.
</blockquote>

<p>I shit you not, I didn't change a single letter of that email.
If you're keeping track, that's three spelling errors, two missing
capital letters, one missing question mark, a whole lot of pointless
ALLCAPS, and one incomprehensible phrase ("inder take driviong lessons"?)</p>
<p>I was going to send a polite email explaining why this
isn't a good way to handle customer response, but it seems I can't
be bothered and would just rather blog about it here. I'm passive-aggressive
like that.</p>
<p>Since then I've received a recommendation for another driving school
from a friend. I won't be emailing them.</p>

<p>I went to Starbucks this morning to treat myself to my usual decaf
tall non-fat with-whip mocha (personal), and there was a lady behind me in line 
with a baby and a five-year-old boy. The boy was a handful—at
one point he disappeared into the kitchen, and he didn't want to stand
still and wait in line. The mom was obviously tired, anxious and overwhelmed.
Meanwhile, baby in one hand, Blackberry in the other, she was calling
friends cheerily asking what kind of coffee they took.  You know when
you watch someone make a phone call and their whole mood changes when
they're on the call? It was like that: <em>tired grumpy tired HAPPY BRIGHT HAPPY
tired grumpy tired</em></p>
<p>First of all, why would you put on yourself the extra work of getting
coffee for all your friends when you have your hands full with your
kids? It's okay to drop a few things when you have little kids.
Maybe not cleaning the toilet and showering, but bringing coffee is definitely
expendable. And second, why be all happy and "Hey, I'm 
bringing you coffee!" to your friends while only 
the strangers in Starbucks get to see how anxious and overwhelmed you
are. Your friends don't care about coffee, they care about you.  (The strangers
at Starbucks don't care about you, they care about coffee.) It's okay to
tell your friends that you're overwhelmed and you're going to beg off
bringing coffee for a while.  You can be the coffee and treats 
bringer again when your little one is old enough to carry a bag of croissants.</p>
<hr>
<p>I guess I have two points. First, if you're feeling overwhelmed, you're
not doing anyone any favours pretending everything's fine. Mostly people
will believe you, and you won't get the help you need, which sucks.
But just as bad is the overly
optimistic impression you're giving other parents of the level of 
busy-ness and achievement they should be able to manage.</p>
<p>And second, when you have little kids you have to set aside some of
your old identity. (Unless your old identity included about ten hours
a day of absolute sloth, in which case parenting will fit in just fine.
Except you'll have to set aside the "I'm slothful" part of your old 
identity. No, I'm going to stick with my original claim—when
you have kids you have to set something aside.) Maybe it's being a
great housekeeper, maybe it's being an employed person, maybe it's
being a gym rat, maybe it's being someone who sees all the latest
movies, maybe it's being the one who brings the coffee. When you 
add a baby to your life something has to give. </p>
<p>But it doesn't have to
give forever: when you're stuck at home with a four-month-old and you're
staring down the abyss of babyhood and toddlerdom and preschoolerness
it seems like everything you ever loved about your old life is gone
for good, or at least unrecognizably mangled. But if you just wait,
you'll get it back. Your kid will be able to walk so you can carry
an extra coffee; your kid will go to preschool so you can go to the
gym; your kid will start school or daycare so you can work.</p>
<p>When you have a baby it seems like you have to hang on to everything
about yourself until your fingernails bleed, that if you don't you'll
lose yourself completely in snot and diapers. But all that stuff that
made you you is still in there. It will still be there for you in
three or four or five years when your hands are free and you have a 
minute or two to yourself.</p>
<hr>
<p>Wow, that turned way more profound than I meant it to.</p>
