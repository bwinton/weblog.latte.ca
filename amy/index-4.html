<em>Bitten</em> is essentially a collection of case studies of bites, stings, and
the other indignities that are inflicted on humans by the animals with which we
share our world, interspersed with descriptions of the mechanisms and chemistry
by which the damage is wrought.  Awesome!  It is well-written and appropriately
gruesome.
</p>
<p>
Things I learned: snails can kill you; if it's
dangerous in the rest of the world it's probably deadly in Australia; Sharon
Stone's husband was bitten  by a Komodo dragon; lots of things that seem to be
healing okay for the first couple of weeks then turn really ugly; American 
patients often don't return for follow-up care or complete their courses of
medication.

Either Nagami or her editor seems excessively fond of "sic":
"The child was in a semi-comatose state and only made to give unintelligible
answers with difficulty [sic]."
What's wrong with that?  I do not know.  
</p>
<p>
How about this?  "So its bacteria 
was [sic] then inside the bone."  Plural "bacteria" and singular "was", maybe?
How pedantic is that?  I'm think "sic" should only be used 
if there may be some confusion about meaning that would
be cleared if the reader knew that the quote was left in its original, 
uncorrected form.  Using sic just to prove that you are smarter than the
quotee is lame.
</p>
<p>
The last one is the best: "beautiful 19 month old Rhesus Macaque ... all the
paper's [sic] from his vet showing his shots are all up to date.  He has never
been in a lab, he was born in a private breed does not do well with children."
How did they decide to sic the apostrophic error and yet leave, oh, pretty much
every other word in the quote unsicced?  Why not just sic the whole thing?

This book is about how to lose weight by eating foods with a low glycemic index.
The book is written clearly, and describes the diet in simple terms with a few
recipes and lots of hints and good ideas.  If I were going to go on a diet I
would go on something like this, except that I love bread far too much to give
it up to the extent that the diet requires.  I'd rather be fat than give up
bread.
</p>
<p>
I like that the book is written by a Canadian doctor and is clearly for a 
Canadian audience (there are other editions for other parts of the world);
he refers to Canadian brands and discusses the difficulty in getting exercise
when it's snowy and miserable half the year.

The subtitle pretty much says it all (it would have to, being that long,
really) -- this is a memoir by a forensic anthropologist who worked for
the UN digging up mass graves of genocide victims in Rwanda and Central
Europe to prove that they were, in fact, genocide victims.  I read this book 
because I wanted another perspective on Rwanda, and because I'm 
interested in forensic anthropology.
</p>
<p>
It wasn't as sciency as I thought it might be, although there was
enough detail to get the job done.  The book was more about the
author's (I was going to say "Clea's", that's how personal it was)
journey through the various missions.  
She writes about how she feels when she's working
and when she isn't, how she deals with the unique stress of digging
up people, often children, who have been murdered.  She writes about
how the work she does changes her view of the world.  She's very honest
and forthcoming about her feelings and about her mistakes and about
how her outlook changes.
</p>
<p>
She also talks bluntly about the work environments, the management, 
the teams, the bureaucracy.  It made me realize, once again, that
no matter how much you love your work, you're going to have to put
up with some bullshit from somebody at some point -- no job is great
all the time, not even digging rotting bodies out of soggy graves
in the burning sun.

This book is about the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service, which goes
out and investigates epidemics wherever they occur in the world.  It's
structured one-epidemic-per-chapter and pretty much every chapter is
interesting.  There's a chapter on anthrax, on AIDS, West Nile, smallpox,
cholera in a refugee camp in Zaire, TB among a transgender community in
Baltimore, and of course, SARS.

McKenna is a good writer and this is a page-turner.  I hope she writes
more books.

    <p>I thought this was a collection of short stories, but it's actually
mostly excerpts from young adult novels with female teenage protagonists.
They were all good and made me vaguely interested in reading the full
books (but not actually enough to go ahead and read them).  The only 
thing I particularly noticed was that the stories seemed grimmer than
the stuff I read when I was a kid; there was one about the Holocaust,
one about smallpox in a native family, one about living in Afghanistan
during the rule of the Taliban...  Maybe I read stuff like that when I
was a kid and it just didn't make an impact -- I was pretty shallow.</p>

Mayer Hillman is a smart guy, and he wrote this book about global
warming.  He starts by explaining global warming, and why it's a 
real and major problem facing the world.  He presents it as a moral
concern, that it is up to us to make major changes to our lifestyle
in order the save the planet for the next generation.  That we
<em>must</em>.  
</p>
<p>
He proposes a method by which this would be done,
basically that we determine an acceptable amount of carbon monoxide
we can allow into the atmosphere, divide that by the number of people
on the planet, and then through one means or another enforce that
limit, equally on every citizen of the globe.  No special exceptions
for countries and very few for individuals.
</p>
<p>
Hillman earnestly declares that the only solution to the problem
of global warming is to limit the amount of carbon people are
entitled to generate (he goes through numerous alternatives,
and explains why he believes they are insufficient).  Several times
in the book he says that there is no choice in the matter, the 
only other alternatives are to prevent the developing world from
developing or to just allow global warming to happen, and those
are not acceptable alternatives.  
</p>
<p>
Perhaps I'm cynical, but I'm
pretty sure that last is exactly what is going to happen; time and
again in history humans have seen shit coming down the pipe and
done nothing.  People are too selfish, too lazy, and too obsessed
with economic "progress" and with status to make the huge and
immediate changes that would be needed to prevent the coming disaster.
I would love to be wrong.
</p>
<p>
My lifestyle is pretty low-impact (we don't have a car and I do
most of my daily living on foot, we live in a multi-family dwelling,
and we don't consume a great deal of stuff, relatively speaking) but
Hillman's book has driven it home to me that the exorbitant number of
flights I take pretty much blows that all away.  Since Delphine was
born we have been to Saskatchewan, New York, Florida, Las Vegas, 
and Saskatchewan again, and we're going to Florida again in February.
That's twelve flights in less than two years: fucking ridiculous.  I
have to cut down, which gives me this horrible fear that I will only
ever be going to Saskatchewan from now on.  Argh.

It's New Year's Eve.  Blake and I invited a few people over, casual-like,
but for one reason or another no-one is coming, so it's just the two
of us.  Delphine went to bed at 6:30 and we tidied up (I hate to start the
new year with a messy house) and now we're watching Firefly and eating
party food leftover from Christmas: stilton and crackers, chips and dip,
peanuts, soda and gingerbread.  I hope to be able to stay awake until 
midnight, although I don't expect I'll have a drink since I am once again
in post-ovulatory limbo.
</p>
<p>
2004 was good to me, I must say.  Nothing much happened; a trip to Florida,
a trip to Las Vegas, a trip to Saskatchewan (I travel too much) and not
really much else other than day-to-day life, with choir and visits to and
from Morgan and Baba and Zaide, and baby things.
</p>
<p>
In 2005 I am going to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>have a baby</li>
 <li>work (for money)</li>
 <li>go back to eating healthy, and maybe even healthier than that</li>
 <li>paint the kitchen</li>
 <li>do some yoga</li>
 <li>knit</li>
 <li>pollute less</li>
 <li>take Delphine swimming more</li>
</ul>

I'm looking forward to it; I think 2005 will be good to me too.

I just got my period.  My first period since July 2002.

And it's appalling.  It's revolting.  It's disgusting.  Why do we
put up with this shit?  It's like Nature herself is conspiring to

And to add insult to injury when I picked up my Keeper I realized

I hope y'all are reading the 
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/~arbrown/reading.html">book list</a> because
that's the only part of this site that's getting any attention these days.
</p>
<p>
Winter is setting in.  We got a gorgeous snowfall the other day, the kind
with really fluffy flakes and no wind, so the snow heaps up on the branches
and telephone wires and makes everything all pretty.  It melted by the 
end of the day so I have no pictures, but I made a point of stopping and
enjoying it and remembering it so I have a picture in my head, at least.
Sorry, y'all are going to have to imagine it based on my inept narrative.
</p>
<p>
Today is Saturday. Delphine is at Baba and Zeyda's sleeping over because
last night was Blake's company Christmas party.  It was at Five Doors 
North, which is just a few blocks away from here.
I got all dressed up in a new low-cut lacy black top -- very foxy --
and my same tired old ballgown skirt that I pull out for every event ever.
I was way overdressed -- most other people were in jeans -- but I am
grown-up enough that I don't care.  I don't have anything else to dress 
up for this year.
</p>
<p>
We are hosting a party here, next week, but I don't think I want to wear
my foxy top -- it's kind of tight.  Okay for standing up or hiding behind
a table, but when I sit it shows all my rolls so it's not good for sitting
on an easy chair.  I think I will wear brown pants and my new pink v-neck
sweater.  (My mother told me to buy new clothes for Christmas and she
would pay, so now
I have two pairs of pants and three sweaters that fit.  What a treat!
I look like I have lost forty pounds!)
</p>
<p>
Today I have choir practice at 10:00 because tomorrow is the concert:
<em>Messiah</em> with the orchestra playing period instruments.  We have
done <em>Messiah</em> a couple of times since I have been with the choir,
so we're really good at it note-wise which frees us up to do interesting
things with tempo and expression and stuff.  Jurgen is really excited.
We've already sold out the concert -- <em>Messiah</em> is our cash cow,
the piece we do when we need money to do a piece with a big orchestra
that isn't going to attract much of an audience, which I think would effectively
describe the other two concerts we are doing this year.  Tomorrow's
concert should be particularly profitable since we only have a small
orchestra.
</p>
<p>
I am still full from dinner last night.  The food was served tapas style,
which is the new trend.  Everyone gets a little plate and they bring the
food to the table on big platters.  I do not like this trend.  First, there
was no menu so we had no idea what to expect and it was impossible to 
pace yourself.  I filled up on pasta and rice (the second course) because
I thought that was all there was; all three starch dishes had meat in them
so I didn't figure there would be a meat course, but I was wrong.  
</p>
<p>
Second, it was very wasteful.  Each
platter from our table (of twelve people) was sent back to the kitchen
at least a third full.  Either they throw it out, which would suck, or they
repackage it and give it to someone else, which would suck more.  The only
non-sucking option is that they give it to Second Harvest or some similar
feeding-the-foodless-type organization.  
</p>
<p>
Third, the people in the middle
of the table spend half their dinner passing heavy platters back and forth,
and you have to bother them every time you want to try something different.
Finally, I just don't do well with family-style service; when there is food
in front of me, especially tasty food, I eat it, even when I am full.  It
is why I am so fat.  So I ate way way way too much last night;  I was easily
keeping pace with the pregnant woman beside me.  Although it
was really very tasty.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and I also had two amaretto sours, which the kind waitress brought 
for me after I flailed around trying to think of a fun fruity girly drink.
I can never remember what cocktails to order, but amaretto sours are going to
be my go-to drink from now on -- sweet, sour, bitter, and girly but not
too girly.  Sadly I might be a little bit pregnant -- I am in that 
post-ovulatory-pre-menstrual limbo -- so I hope if I am I didn't do any
damage.  It was kind of stupid, in retrospect; no-one knows how much
and when you can safely drink when you are knocked up so I should have
abstained altogether.  I hope I didn't screw up.

Morgan was saying she needs more stuff to check on the Internet,
so here are some sites I think you all should read if you don't
already:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://smartypants.diaryland.com/">Mimi Smartypants</a>
adopted a baby girl a year ago.  Her baby is a couple of months
older than Delphine.  (When she first, um, got Nora it totally
blew my mind that Mimi had an eight-month-old, and I only had a
six-month-old, but <em>I had a been a mother for six months and
Mimi had only just started</em>.  I think I was jealous, and
rightly so because it only starts to get good at eight months.
All babies should start at eight months -- maybe I will send my
next one to an orphanage for the first eight months.  Or to Sascha
and Leontine.)  Mimi is very funny, especially the one
where <a href="http://smartypants.diaryland.com/090104.html">Nora
feeds the cat</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.dooce.com/">Dooce</a> has an eight-month-old
named Leta who is much more of a handful than Delphine ever was,
and also a very amusing constipation problem and a slightly less
amusing (but only slightly) mental illness problem.  
</p>
<p>
Okay, that's only two, but someone lost all my bookmarks so I'm
groping blindly around the Internet at the moment.  If I think of 
any more I'll post them, or you could just look at the list of
journals over on the right, but I haven't updated that for ages
and I can't guarantee any of them will be funny or interesting.
