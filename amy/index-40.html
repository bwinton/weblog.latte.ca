There are hardly any urban animals in Tokyo. I didn't see any wild mammals at
all (although I'm sure they have rats) and the only birds I saw were
crows and sparrows. There are cats around shrines because the monks
feed them.</p>
<hr>
<p>When you go to a restaurant you get a little towel in a plastic bag.
Sometimes it's a disposable wet wipe, sometimes it's a little facecloth
(hot or cold). The catch is you don't get a napkin.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="../images/amy/japan/hydrangeas.jpg" align="left" alt="hydrangeas growing by
the subway">
There are hydrangeas everywhere; in parks and gardens, but also growing wild
by train tracks. I also spotted daylilies and hostas — it was cool to see my
garden friends in their native environment.</p>
<hr>
<p>July in Tokyo is really freaking hot. Really, and humid too. They don't
report a Humidex, which is good because it'd be up in the 40s and it would
make everyone feel worse. </p>
<p><img src="../images/amy/japan/cloths.jpg" align="right" alt="facecloths for sale">
The good people of Tokyo don't suck it up and act all stoic, they hate it and
deal with it in a number of ways. Hand fans are very popular and no-one is shy
about using them — lots of companies give out fans as promotional material.
Everyone carries little <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/schmatte">schmattes</a> to mop themselves
with. You can buy them all over the place.</p>
<p>A lot of ladies carry parasols. These are distinguished from umbrellas
by their eyelet lace edging. I assume if you are expecting rain and sun on
the same day you have to carry both devices.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="../images/amy/japan/manhole.jpg" align="left" alt="manhole">
All the manhole covers are pretty, and they're different in every area.</p>
<hr>
<p>They have awesome transit in Tokyo. There are a bunch of different companies
which provide subway and train service, but they all work together 
seamlessly because they use the same payment card system. Yet again the TTC
looks like a bunch of bush league amateurs by comparison. (Not that they're
dealing with the same size user base. But still. They could suck less.)</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="../images/amy/japan/sidewalkgarden.jpg" align="right" alt="sidewalk garden">
No-one in Tokyo has a garden so some people get their green thumb on by
creating sidewalk gardens; pots and planters on the sidewalk. I saw
a rosebush in one, and a little fish pond with water plants and actual
fish in another.</p>
<hr>
<p>Most restaurants serve meals as a collection of little dishes; instead of
ordering, say, steak which comes with veg and potatoes, you'd order a little
plate of steak, a little plate of veg and a little plate of potatoes.  And you
don't order everything up front, you order a few things, then add some more
stuff later if you're still hungry.  (You also share with everyone, so if you
don't feel like what everyone else feels like, you're screwed. Until dessert,
then everyone gets what they want.)</p>
<p>It's a great way to eat - you can order the right amount of food and
stop when you're full instead of being tempted to finish a big plateful.
And you can order the exactly kind of food you want and the restaurant
doesn't get to screw you by serving you a giant pile of cheap carbs and calling
it a deal.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="../images/amy/japan/childseat.jpg" align="right" alt="child seat in bathroom">
Some of the bathroom stalls have little child seats mounted on the wall 
for you to park your baby when you pee. I cannot tell you how much I 
wanted this feature when my kids were babies!</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="../images/amy/japan/mangosoftserve.jpg" align="left" alt="mango soft-serve
ice cream">
They have great softserve flavours. I don't know why we stick with 
chocolate and vanilla here, because mango-vanilla swirl is sublime.
I also spotted green tea and black sesame.</p>
<hr>
<p>Parks and playgrounds in Tokyo run the gamut from lame to non-existent.
They have a few big parks, but they're not big on lawns and greenspace.
I spotted a handful of playgrounds, but they all featured the same
monkey bars, two swings and a metal slide. I also didn't spot any children
at the playgrounds. I don't know if Japanese kids
play at private playgrounds, or if they just don't play at all and are at
organized activities.</p>
<hr>
<p>They have 24-hour karaoke. (<em>24-hour karaoke!!!</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="../images/amy/japan/shoes.jpg" align="left" alt="shoes"><img src="../images/amy/japan/socks.jpg" align="right" alt="socks">
Shoes in Japan are awesome. Okay, plenty of women wear boring shoes, but 
there are some amazing shoes worn just out and about. And the fancy shoe
ladies are dedicated to high heels.</p>
<p>To go with the shoes are lots of fancy sock options; some girls even wear 
socks with strappy sandals. They have sock configurations for every kind of
shoes; tiny socks with lace mary-jane straps and lace trim to wear with ballet
flats, socks with a split at the toe to wear with thong sandals, socks with
cut-out heels for...  when you feel like wearing socks with cut-out heels.
Socks in Japan have gone beyond their traditional role as foot/shoe protectors;
they augment the shoe.</p>

<p>I cleaned my purse out today. It had been getting heavier and heavier,
and I was quite curious as to what was in there. </p>

<p>Some highlights:
</p>
<ul>
<li>vast quantities of paper napkins (only some of which were used)</li>
  <li>Chinese restaurant flyer</li>
  <li>pirate eye patch</li>
  <li>pirate map</li>

  <li>yoga studio brochure</li>
  <li>Ontario Science Centre flyer</li>
  <li>four lip glosses</li>
  <li>Licemeister™ lice comb</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been doing a lot of work-work lately, and not finding time for life
maintainance.  The state of my purse, before I cleaned it out, was much like
the state of my wallet, and the state of my desk, and the state of my yard, and
indeed the state of my house. When that much of your life is in disarray it
makes you feel like a bit of a failure. I was really glad to get a chance to
clean out my purse, and I hope I can get to some of that other stuff soon.</p>

<p>Life is coming at me too fast lately. </p>
<p>We're still in the middle of the
bathroom reno (basement powder room is done, upstairs bathroom is 
entirely non-functional).  This means I have to find somewhere else to 
shower.</p>
<p>I just helped publish a <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/">book</a>, which is
really cool but the work keeps coming; we have a print edition, but we also
want to produce various different eBooks (and the giant learning curve that
entails), not to mention fixing errata and keeping the website up to date.</p>
<p>The girls' school spring fair is this weekend, which means I will be
baking for the bake sale tomorrow, and both Blake and I are volunteering
on the day of.</p>
<p>Delphine has had a persistent infestation of lice, for almost two weeks.  We've
treated with the chemical agent and picked nits for hours, but that didn't do
the trick so I treated her again today with some herbal stuff of dubious value
and spent another hour or so picking nits.</p>
<p>My brother is getting married in July, which is going to be completely
awesome, but I've never been to Japan before and I have a ton of things
to do, get, and read about before I go.</p>
<p>Then there's the usual groceries, laundry, cooking, picking up and
dropping off, vacuuming, etc, etc.</p>
<p>And, finally, inevitably, I just scratched my head and came away with a live
louse.  So now I'm off to shave my head. Or something.</p>

<p>Yesterday Canada elected a Conservative majority government. Our 
House of Commons has 308 seats, and the Conservatives won 167 of
then with 40% of the popular vote. The NDP is our new official
opposition with 102 seats and 31% of the popular vote. The Liberals,
Canada's "natural governing party", suffered a huge setback winning
only 34 seats and 19% of the popular vote.</p>
<p>My politics lie somewhere around the NDP/Greens, but I'm not partisan.
If there was a party that ran on a platform of evidence-based
compassionate pragmatism I would vote for it, but there isn't so I do
the best I can. This time I voted for Carolyn Bennett, our incumbent Liberal
candidate, because she's clever and effective. It wasn't a difficult
choice, because I would have been happy to have Michael Ignatieff as
Prime Minister.</p>
<p>I'm not happy about this result; I'm pretty miserable, actually. Stephen
Harper's faults are well-documented elsewhere, so I won't go into that.
I'm not on-board with the Conservative platform, obviously, and I worry that
with a majority they will make changes to this country that lead it further and
further away from what I value.</p>
<p>I'm also frustrated with our electoral system. Electoral reform
makes my head spin but I understand enough to know that our system is broken
and our government doesn't accurately represent us. Dave Meslin can
<a href="http://meslin.wordpress.com/2011/05/02/beyond_band-aids/">
explain it</a> better than I can.</p>
<p>So the question remains: As a citizen, what do I do next? </p>
<p>There's a school of thought that says that everything will work out and nothing
will go horribly wrong no matter who is in government. I think this is the
school of thought that non-voters follow, because if that's true, why vote?:
stuff will work itself out, everything will be fine.</p>
<p>If I followed that school of thought I would just carry on exactly as I
have been. Of course if I followed that school of thought I wouldn't have
been so upset last night when the results came in. In fact, I probably
wouldn't even have watched.</p>
<p>There's another school of thought the members of which are rending their
garments today: the CBC is going to be dismantled, abortion and gay marriage
outlawed, gun control repealed, mega-jails built on every corner. That school
is well-represented in my Twitter feed, but it's not one I subscribe to either.
I'm not sure what would prevent the Harper government from doing all that:
perhaps they mostly don't really want to, perhaps they fear that the electorate
would disapprove and not re-elect them, perhaps there are checks and balances
in place that would otherwise stimie them.  But I don't believe a Conservative
majority equals the Hellmouth opening.</p>
<p>If I followed that school of thought... well, I don't know what those people
are doing. Drinking, I guess.</p>
<p>This is what I think. I think things don't just work out fine by themselves. I
think they work out because of the hard work of thousands of people writing
letters and articles, rallying support (or just plain rallying), raising money,
going on TV, and doing all the other things besides voting that democracy
entails. </p>
<p>And so I'm going to email Carolyn Bennett's office and see what I can do
to help. Help immigrants, help families, help seniors. Help make (keep) this
country great.</p>

The Amazing Two Bathroom Home-Value-Inflating Reno Extravaganza
is plodding along nicely. The basement powder room is framed out,
the plumbing and electrical are roughed in and the drywall is 
up. (Oddly enough the guys who hang the drywall are not the guys
who tape and plaster it, so we're in between those two stages
at the moment.)</p>
<p>But I digress. This post exists to ask for your help. We're totally
redecorating the upstairs bathroom and I have exhausted my teeny tiny
decorating muscles.</p>
<p>As you can see in the collage above, the floor tile is 
<a href="http://www.olympiatile.com/products/porcelain/unglazed_porcelain/tropical_grass.html">a kind of stripey grey (it's the "White" colour)</a>, in
12" by 24" rectangles. </p>
<p>We're tiling the walls halfway up with <a href="http://www.olympiatile.com/products/glass/cristallo.html">elongated glass subway tile</a> (4" x 16"), mainly
white with about 15% bottle green, and a few tiles-worth of white
square mosaic tiles in there for texture (and because Delphine really likes
them).</p>
<p>The bathtub is really plain and rectangular. The sink is 
<a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/80178693">Ikea's
Vitviken</a>. (Or perhaps I should say sinkS! Whoo!) The vanity
is shiny and white and plain, the medicine cabinet is shiny and plain,
the faucets are shiny and sleek and apparently not discussed anywhere on the
Internet (but <a href="../images/amy/bathroomReno/kamato.jpg">here's</a> the
box).</p>
<p>So what colour paint is going to work with the bottle green tiles? Find
me a shower curtain the softens up all that sleek shininess. Tell me
what else I need! Shop for me, my pretties!</p>

<p>Wednesdays are tricky, dinner-wise. Delphine's art class ends at 5:15, which
means we're usually not home until 5:45 or 6:00. Dinner is at 6:00.
(Theoretically.) If I'm extra clever and don't get distracted by work,
I put something in the crock pot and set the table in advance so we can
sit right down and eat. Yesterday I wasn't extra clever.</p>
<p>We got home at 5:45 and there was nothing cooking anywhere, but I did
have an idea. It started with half a pound of <a href="http://www.perthporkproducts.com/">Perth Pork</a> bacon. Any idea that starts with Perth Pork bacon is a good idea.</p>
<p>I cut the bacon into little bits and fried it up. When it was starting
to get crispy I (reluctantly) poured off about half the fat. Then I 
added a cup of arborio rice to the pan and mixed it up. I minced two
cloves of garlic and added that, then I poured in two cups of chicken
broth, put the lid on and walked away for about twelve minutes.</p>
<p>When I came back, I added a cup of frozen peas and a large tomato,
cubed, and also a bit more water since the rice wasn't quite done.
I put the lid on, let that simmer for another couple of minutes, and
then served it with that cheap "parmesan" in a can.</p>
<p>It was delicious and beloved; everyone had seconds. (Cordelia ate around
the tomatoes.) Delphine took some for lunch today. Yay! Dinner victory!</p>

<p>Friday was our last day in New York.  (I cleverly planned our trip to provide
a weekend at home before the trip and one after. Unfortunately as it turns out,
weekends in New York are on the same days as weekends in Toronto, and so
Sascha and Leontine and Nina could not hang out with us during the 
day. Instead, they were kind enough to spend two evenings with us and completely
annihilate Nina's bedtime two school nights in a row. If that isn't love
I don't know what is.)</p>
<p>Anyway, Friday was our last day. We were flying out from Newark at
two, so we had enough time to do a thing before leaving. The thing we
did was brunch at M. Wells (<em>Magasin Wells</em>), a little hipster
diner a couple of subway stops away from the hotel. The place didn't open
until 10, so we had a donughnut for first breakfast while we packed, and
then walked over. </p>
<p>It wasn't a nice walk — we walked under an elevated train for
some of the way, and it was through a kind of industrial-ish area. Still,
the sun was bright and warm, and it was interesting. Delphine picked up
a lot of beer bottle caps for her collection.</p>
<p>M. Wells is a super-cool place with a somewhat convoluted menu.
Brunch-y things were mixed up with lunch-y things, there were dishes
with brains in them, there was clear evidence that they could make
bacon and eggs and pancakes, but no bacon and eggs and pancakes on the
menu, because bacon and eggs and pancakes are not hip. (I had expected
something more diner-ish so I was a little taken aback by the menu.)</p>
<p>Anyway, Blake had tortilla Española, Delphine had a scone with apple
butter, and Cordelia and I had buckwheat crêpes with maple syrup, which
was billed as "maple syrup <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploye">ploye</a>". It was delicious —
thin, heavy pancakes drenched in maple syrup. Everything else was good,
too.</p>
<p>We went back to the hotel to pick up our bags, then began the long trek to
Newark: N to Times Square, change to the 1 to 34th station, then a NJ Transit train to Newark Airport.  We were not particularly early, so I was all fretty,
but I liked the cute little shuttle train from the NJ Transit stop to the 
terminal at the airport. </p>
<p>We were flying Porter, and they were a helpful and friendly as their 
reputation suggests. The plane was small but comfortable, and the staff
were patient with the girls. It was a bit of a rocky ascent, probably because
it was a prop plane, but once we reached altitude it was a smooth ride.
We were back in Toronto in about an hour. Porter provides a shuttle bus
right to the Royal York, so the rest of our trip home was effortless.</p>
<p>We had been reluctant to come home: we felt like we could have stayed
for a few more days. I think that's the perfect way to end a trip. I might
even have suggested that we would go back some day.</p>

<p>Thursday in New York was the day I had planned to not plan anything. I
knew that in the course of exploring on Tuesday and Wednesday we would
come up with something we wanted to do on Thursday, so I left it open, "TBD".</p>
<p>What we decided to do was find a playground. The girls had been gazing
longingly at every playground we passed on Wednesday, so we decided to carve
out Thursday morning for some quality playing (them)/sitting in the sun (us)
time.</p>
<p>Sascha directed us to the really cool playground in Central Park, but 
Central Park is full of winding roads with no names, and we ended up at the
wrong playground. (Luckily Central Park is also full of playgrounds.) The girls
played there for a while but then proclaimed it lame, so we set off with a
renewed determination to find the <em>right</em> playground, which we eventually
did: the <a href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/heckscher-playground.html">Heckscher Playground</a>. It features a cement fortress-like structure beside a giant (like, building-sized) rock, as well as lots of swings and a really tall slide, like I haven't seen since I was a kid.</p>
<p>The girls had an excellent time, Blake got a sunburn, I met a nice Irish
guy and his son Finn, and we all watched a drunk girl get taken away in
an ambulance (it was St. Patrick's Day).</p>
<p>After the playground we grabbed a hot dog and a pretzel, then walked up to the
Museum of Natural History where we elected to pay $40 to get in (did you know
it's a "Pay What You Can" museum?) and spent at least an hour in the Discovery
Room. The Discovery Room is apparently the Museum of Natural History's best
kept secret, because there were, like, five other kids in there.  It's bright
little room with a well-presented hands-on collection: dinosaur bones, clothes,
bugs under a microscope, a cabinet of natural wonders like shells, coral,
skulls and rocks. The girls had a great time exploring and Blake and I had
a great time sitting.</p>
<p>Our next stop was a bakery at 87th and 1st to get black and white cookies.
Now, I swear black and white cookies were everywhere when we were in New
York in 2003, but Sascha says they fell out of fashion years before that. To
be fair, "everywhere" might just mean "every Starbucks", but they certainly
weren't hard to come by in 2003. In 2011, I had to ask Twitter where
to get them, and my lovely friend Shawn pointed me at Glaser's Bakery.
Not only are their black and white cookies delicious, they also have a 
fine selection of cupcakes, eclairs, danishes and things I don't even know
the names of. It was totally worth the detour.</p>
<p>Dinner was delicious ordered-in Indian food with Sascha and Leontine and Nina,
and gulab jamun for dessert, and bedtime was late.</p>

<p>Day three, Wednesday, dawned early but not bright with a drip, drip, drip in
the living room. It was raining and the roof of our hotel was leaking into our
top-floor suite. It wasn't a disastrous leak, but in the dark it produced the
kind of hard-to-identify noise which makes imaginative little girls very
nervous. After we had reassured the girls and set up the ice bucket to catch
the drips we went downstairs for our daily waffles and doughnuts.</p>
<p>Our trajectory was east that day, into the wilds of Queens and ultimately to
the New York Hall of Science, a.k.a. the Queens science museum. (We got in free
because we have a membership at the Ontario Science Centre.) The first exhibit
we visited was about science in the Muslim World, which was pretty cool. There
was an interesting exhibit on light and optics, another on sports science (I
believe all science museums are required to have an area devoted to sports
science), and a bunch of stuff about space. It was fun but assumed a fairly
high level of literacy — Cordelia was reduced to being one of those
annoying little kids who runs around pounding buttons because there wasn't much
designed for kids at her level.</p>
<p>We went for a late lunch at <a href="http://www.tortillerianixtamal.com/">Tortilleria 
Nixtamal</a>, a fantastic little place recommended by Sascha. We had nachos
(with Mexican cheese, avocado, peppers and beans), tamales with chicken mole,
pork tacos, and the girls had fish tacos. I had Mexican Coca-Cola, which is
apparently sweeter than American Coca-Cola, but I didn't notice. It came in a
cool bottle, though.  Blake had a cool drink the name of which I have
forgotten. Everything was excellent, but the nachos were my favourite —
crispy chips, fresh toppings in just the right proportions. Afterwards the
girls and I enjoyed an ice pop, or as mine was labelled, "Artificial Coconut
Quiescently Frozen Dairy Confection". So much tastier than it sounds!</p>
<p>By the time we finished lunch the sun had come out and we were on track to be late
meeting Leontine and Nina at the Children's Museum of the Arts in Manhattan. We found our
way, with some twisting and turning, through the neighbourhood back to 103rd St
station and headed west.</p>
<p>The Children's Museum of the Arts has lofty goals but my impression of it from
the hour or so I spent there was of an arts-and-crafts oriented drop-in centre.
The main floor had various art stations: painting, cutting, that stuff you make
out of Borax and glue. Downstairs there was a ball pit stocked not with the
usual little plastic balls but with those giant exercise balls, and a dress-up
centre. It was pretty cool but I missed the "museum" part. Then again I didn't
really look for it. The girls had a great time bouncing in the ball pit,
dressing up, and listening to an energetic rendition of Cressida Cowell's "That
Rabbit Belongs To Emily Brown". Delphine made a picture of a turtle. Blake and
I got to hang out with Leontine, which was fun. She's awesome. (I love it when
my friends marry awesome people.)</p>
<p>When the museum closed we peeled the children away and set them loose on the
streets of Manhattan to terrorize passers-by with their erratic behaviour and
injudicious piggybacking. Also irrepressible adorableness: they made a lovely
trio.</p>
<p>Our intention was to go out for dinner, and since Blake was the only person
with a preference, and Blake's preference was to go to Pizzeria Uno (why don't
we have those here?!) we decided to go the Pizzeria Uno that's <em>right</em> by, I
mean mere <em>blocks</em> away from, our hotel in Queens. So close we could almost
walk it! </p>
<p>Closeness to the hotel was desirable because before dinner we had to stop by
the hotel to deliver <a href="http://tanyamurdoch.viewbook.com/album/paintingsanddrawings?p=1#27">this
painting</a> by my friend Tanya which I had bought to give to Sascha and
Leontine.  Buying art for other people is always tricky, maybe even
unadvisable, but I think this went pretty well. Leontine and Sascha liked it,
or else they were really polite and good actors. Delphine kind of ruined it
— or added a level of intrigue — by saying they were evil
bubbles...</p>
<p>Our next mission was to get to Pizzeria Uno, which seems simple but was
complicated by the fact that it's almost too far to walk, it was dinnertime and
we had three small short-legged children to think of. Sascha thought it would
be easier to catch a bus, Blake was with him on the bus plan, I was indifferent
and Leontine was strongly against taking the bus, which is apparently her usual
stance on the issue.</p>
<p>As always when taking the bus, it could have gone either way: the bus could have
arrived promptly and taken us where we wanted to go, or we could have waited
for ages and ages, getting crankier, tireder and hungrier, until we finally
decided to take some other bus which got us slightly closer so we could walk
the rest of the way, inevitably being passed by the original bus as we walked.
Nobody's mind was changed about the value of buses that evening.</p>
<p>Finally we arrived at the restaurant, where we marvelled at the calorie counts
on the menu, and were perplexed at the lack of prices for alcohol and the
supreme awfulness of the waitress. The grown-ups all had pizza of various
kinds, Nina had macaroni and cheese and Delphine and Cordelia had the exact
same dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets they get at The Longest Yard three blocks
from home.</p>
<p>Then Sascha ordered a car service to drive us home, and we all collapsed into
bed — far too late for the girls and somewhat embarrassingly early for
the grown-ups.</p>

<p>While we were in New York we stayed at the comically-named <a href="http://www.countryinns.com/long-island-city-hotel-ny-11101/nynyquee">Country
Inn &amp; Suites</a> in Queens. It's an incongruous 9-storey building in a slightly
seedy area which didn't seem to have much to offer (although we didn't explore)
apart from Queensboro Plaza station, from which it's a quick ride to westbound
to Manhattan or eastbound to all the cool stuff in Queens which you only know
about if you have friends in, say, Jackson Heights.</p>
<p>One of the most important features of a hotel is a free breakfast buffet, and
this one didn't disappoint. Well, I suppose if you were looking for
high-quality food it might disappoint, but considering the great price we got
for the room I wasn't expecting much. There were strange skinless sausage-like
objects, patties of that yellow foamy "egg", cheap bagels, danishes, doughnuts
and bread, coffee (or hot chocolate or hot water) out of a dispenser, and for
the health-minded, bananas and tubs of fat-free yoghurt. But the highlight
was the make-your-own waffle station: a dispenser oozed pre-made waffle batter
which was then poured onto an electric waffle iron. Two minutes later, uncanny
fluffy goodness. The girls and I had waffles and syrup for breakfast every day.
(There may have been some doughnut consumption as well.) The "sausages" were
savory and sagey, but the egg tasted like the cushion foam it resembled.</p>
<p>After carb-loading we walked down to the station to catch a train into
Manhattan. We bought two seven-day MTA Metrocards — that's right: two.
The girls rode the MTA all week for free! Not 60¢, not 75¢, but
absolutely free.  They got to duck under the turnstiles!  (Each adult gets to
take three children under 44" for free.)</p>
<p>Our first stop was Fifth Avenue, to visit F.A.O. Schwartz and then walk to
the Lego Store at Rockefeller Center. Before we got to F.A.O. Schwartz our
sight was arrested by the looming glass cube which heralds the Fifth
Avenue Apple Store. Well... it was right there; we <em>had</em> to go in! They had
the new iPads to play with, and I looked at docking stations for the bathroom
(shut up) and Delphine and Cordelia found games to play, but all in all
it didn't strike me as any cooler than any other Apple Store, apart from the
great glass elevator. The children wanted to stay and play video games all
day, but I impressed upon them the utter lameness of that idea and finally
dragged them out.</p>
<p>F.A.O. Schwartz turned out to be right next door to the Apple Store, and also
turned out to be closed (it was 9:30 am) so we walked down to the Lego Store,
admired Lego and made custom mini-figs for a while, then walked back (with a
Starbucks detour). F.A.O. Schwartz was big and toy-store-ish, and they had lots
of cool stuff there, but the lines they carry are pretty much the same as the
stuff at Mastermind, except more of everything and the occasional sales
guy/demonstrator. Delphine was swayed by one of the demonstrators, a sweetheart
shilling <a href="http://myachi.com/home.html">Myachis</a>. That's what she
spent her souvenir money on, and Cordelia bought some Playmobil.</p>
<p>Our next stop was the Second Avenue Deli, confusingly not found on Second
Avenue at all: it's the new location! There we met up with Sascha, my oldest
and bestest Internet friend and my excuse for the whole trip. We all had matzo
ball soup, Blake had a brisket sandwich, I had noodle kugel and Delphine had a
meatloaf sandwich. I don't think the matzo ball soup was as good as Baba's, and
I don't think the noodle kugel was as good as our family recipe, but they were
still very tasty. We took some rugelach and hamentashen to go and they turned
out to be delicious indeed.</p>
<p>The Second Avenue Deli was the site of my first kosher faux pas of the day:
I asked in great earnest whether Cordelia could have a glass of milk. If you're
paying attention, which clearly I was not, you will note that the Second
Avenue Deli is a <em>meat</em> restaurant and thus not likely to have handy gallons
of milk hanging around for thirsty five-year-olds. I'm pretty good with kosher
but I always forget about the meat/milk thing. As we shall see.</p>
<p>After lunch we proceeded apace (I'm trying to see how many ways I can say
"went") to the Central Park Zoo. We have a perfectly good zoo in Toronto but
it's miles and miles away and not easily reachable by transit, so we never go
— this would be the first time Cordelia had ever been to a zoo. The
Central Park Zoo is fairly teeny but the animals are all interesting: seals,
penguins, polar bears, tiny adorable tamarins (my favourites). The best thing
was the Tropic Zone, a building containing a rainforest stocked with a
breathtaking number of fantastic tropical birds. Everywhere you looked there
was another amazing bird.  (They said they had fruit bats too, but I didn't see
them.)</p>
<p>We also went to the Tisch's Children's Zoo, which was a fairly small collection
of the usual petting zoo critters, along with lots of interesting climable
sculptures and a giant spider web made of rope. The girls loved it but Blake
and I were freezing in our optimistic spring coats. It was one of those days
which are pleasantly warm when the sun shines and chilly and miserable when it
doesn't, and as the day wore on the sun's appearances became more infrequent.</p>
<p>We finally dragged the children away on the fairly slim premise of going to
Macy's to get Cordelia a pair of shoes. (The shoes we had packed for her were
woefully inadequate — they kept flying off when she ran because the
Velcro on the fake buckle was shot.) The Macy's turned out to be that store
with the cool wooden escalators, which we were on for a long time because the
kids' shoe department is on the seventh floor. We finally (not without some
testiness all around) found shoes which met my requirements for price and fit
and Cordelia's for sparkliness, and then set out in search of dinner.</p>
<p>Blake and I were in that horrible state where you're tired and hungry but
too grumpy to decide on a restaurant: everything looks too expensive,
too seedy, too weird or too chain-y. Finally after blocks of searching we
settled on <a href="http://www.greatrestaurantsmag.com/KOSHER/restaurants/413/aroma-pizza-cafe">Mike's
Pizzeria</a> on 36th Street, a café-style pizza place that looked clean and
nice. I ordered macaroni and cheese for the girls, smoked cheese and mushroom
pizza for me, and Blake got a slice of thick-crust plain cheese pizza. When we
got to the table it came to pass that Delphine didn't want macaroni and
cheese, she wanted pepperoni pizza! Blake said they didn't have any but that
didn't mollify Delphine any, so I agreed to take her up to the counter and
ask if they had any pepperoni pizza.</p>
<p>Well, I know you've all figured it out by now, but I was tired. Obviously,
Mike's Pizzeria was our second kosher establishment of the day (you could
tell from the kippah on the guy behind the counter, and the black-hat 
enjoying his pizza and newspaper) but I once again didn't put it together
until it was spelled out for me. Pizza ⇒ cheese ⇒ milk ⇒ no
meat ⇒ no pepperoni.  Sorry, kid. But the macaroni and cheese was
sublime, and Delphine got her own slice of plain cheese pizza.</p>
<p>After dinner we headed back to the hotel to get the children to bed at a
decent hour, and then we watched TV on my laptop until our bedtime. (The
girls slept on the pullout couch in the living room, and we had a delightfully
huge and  comfortable king-sized bed.)</p>
