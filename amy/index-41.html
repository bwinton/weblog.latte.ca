<p>Last night Delphine and I went to the opera. This March Break Delphine attended
Opera Camp at the <a href="http://coc.ca">COC</a>, and one of the perks was
a pair of tickets to the dress rehearsal of the opera she studied at camp,
Puccini's <em>Gianni Schicchi</em>. It's an opera in one act, and the other
half of the bill was
Alexander Zemlinsky's <em>A Florentine Tragedy</em>.</p>
<p>The Zemlinsky was first, which put a bit of a spanner into our plan to 
leave at intermission in case of extreme boredom or fatigue. Fortunately
there was neither,
despite <em>A Florentine Tragedy</em> being a bit, um, challenging.</p>
<p>Delphine and I read the synopses over before the show and decided <em>A
Florentine Tragedy</em> sounded more like a comedy. A merchant walks in on his
wife and her lover. (Delphine says "boyfriend".) The merchant decides the wife
isn't really having an affair, so he tries to sell the other man some
merchandise. The boyfriend says sure, he'll buy it and then offers the merchant
even more money.  The merchant says the boyfriend can have the whole house! The
boyfriend says he wants the wife! The man says his wife is only good for
housework, and then tells her to sew something! (Actually spin, but Delphine
thought sew.) The men drink wine and then fight, and the man kills the
boyfriend. The wife says, "I didn't realize you were so strong!", and the man
says, "I didn't realize you were so beautiful!" Their love is renewed!</p>
<p>(It makes much more sense now that I know it's based on a play by Oscar
Wilde.)</p>
<p>After we had a giggle at the synopsis we watched the real thing. Delphine
is very attentive at musical performances, and she was rapt through the whole
show — except at the end with the fighting, when she "shut up", as she
calls it: closed her eyes and blocked her ears.</p>
<p>As I said, it was pretty challenging: discordant and free of any melody to
speak of, grim and dark. But we've been going to <a href="http://www.mooredaleconcerts.com/Music-and-Truffles.html">Music and
Truffles</a> for a few years, and they're not shy about throwing all kinds of
crazy music at kids; Delphine doesn't seem to mind it.  The direction and
staging was interesting — the acting was stylized and melodramatic, with
many poses being struck. At several points the performers created dramatic
shadows and silhouettes.</p>
<p>After the show ("That was creepy.") we met up with Tanya and Ursa and
explored the Four Seasons Centre. We asked the girls if they wanted to 
stay for the second show, and there was jumping and glee. </p>
<p><em>Gianni Schicchi</em> was entirely opposite to <em>A Florentine
Tragedy</em>: Italian, not German; sunny, not dark;  comic, not tragic; a cast
of many compared with a cast of three; natural rather than melodramatic acting.
It was a perfect double-bill for the circumstances: if the girls never go to
another opera they will have a pretty good idea of what opera is about.</p>
<p>The direction for <em>Schicchi</em> was great — broad without
being ridiculous. Special credit goes to the supernumary playing
Buoso Donati, who had to die in the first few minutes of the opera and
then be manipulated for the rest of the show, ultimately being
wrapped up and folded into a sofa bed.</p>
<p>Also in the opera were Simone Osborne playing Lauretta, who was
adorable (and sung beautifully) and Peter McGillivray as Marco. He's
performed with my choir a couple of times and is also great. I also
enjoyed the performance of Marco's wife, La Ciesca, by Rihab Chaieb.
And everyone else was really good, too. (Not that I'm a connoisseur
— I'm pretty happy as long as no-one goes flat or falls off the
stage.)</p>
<p>The show ended around 10:00 and we were home by 11:00, which is the latest
Delphine has ever been up, ever. She was hungry (if you stay up late
enough you get hungry all over again!) so we had a piece of toast and
went off to bed, full of the satisfaction of an adventure successfully
completed.</p>

<p>About a week and a half ago our <a href="http://www.ajmadison.com/cgi-bin/ajmadison/LHW0050PQ.html">cheap little washing machine</a> 
 started making an alarming grindy
noise when it was draining, and then the day before Blake left on
business it decided it wasn't going to drain at all; the clothes were
left to wallow in a puddle of soapy water at the end of the load. </p>
<p>There's a drain outlet with a filter on the front of the machine which catches
little bits of crap you've left in your pockets, fluff and soapy slime; we
opened that and a whole wash-load of water flooded out. Fortunately 
the washer lives in our unfinished basement right by a drain, so the water
found a good home without destroying anything on the way. The filter had
caught a whole lot of safety pins, beads and bobby pins (damn you, ballet);
I guess they mean it when they say you have to clear it out every month.</p>
<p>I did some Googling and found some suggestions, some <a href="http://forum.appliancepartspros.com/washer-repair/260509-compact-washer-wont-drain.html">helpful</a>
and some <a href="http://forum.appliancepartspros.com/washer-repair/69871-whirlpool-wont-spin.html">not so helpful</a>. From our information, we deduced
that the problem was somewhere in the <a href="http://www.partselect.ca/ModelFrames.aspx?ModelID=699075&amp;ModelNum=lhw0050pq4&amp;mfgModelNum=&amp;ManufactureID=3&amp;Selected=JPKVCKPK&amp;Position=5&amp;mfg=Whirlpool&amp;Type=&amp;Mark=5">pump and drain system</a> 
(we're brilliant). </p>
<p>So we headed downstairs and starting taking the thing apart; we removed
the back panel, disconnected all the bits of drain pipe we could make sense of,
and failed to find any obvious blockages or other visible problems. That left
the pump, which looked okay, but then that's the nature of pumps. Having
eliminated everything else, we ordered <a href="http://www.partselect.ca/PS972050-Whirlpool-8182415-Washer-Water-Pump.htm?SourceCode=1&amp;SearchTerm=lhw0050pq4&amp;ModelNum=lhw0050pq4">a
new pump</a>.</p>
<p>It arrived a couple of days later (I love 
<a href="http://www.partselect.ca">PartSelect</a>) but Blake was away
and I didn't fancy trying to screw the pump to the bottom of the machine
without someone to hold it up. So I waited until he got home, and we installed
the new pump today. It was tricky and a bit annoying, but not 
spend-my-debt-paying-money-for-someone-else-to-do-it tricky.</p>
<p>And guess what? It works! The machine is purring happily away, draining
like never before, and Blake and I are full of the smug satisfaction
that comes from fixing something yourself instead of being suckers and paying
someone to unscrew some screws and disconnect some hoses.</p>
<p>The next thing, of course, is to fix the stove...</p>

    <div>
<p>This afternoon we all went down to the U of T Child Studies Lab (I could be
totally making up that name) to participate in some science. We've been
on their list since Delphine was a baby, and have participated in
a few studies; they're usually fun and interesting—the girls
love being guinea pigs. (Except on the way home when they're tired and
cranky and hate everything, especially each other.)</p>
<p>Today's study was at a special lab with hidden cameras, in one
of those fantastic red brick Victorian (Edwardian?) houses on Spadina.</p>
<p>The study was on lying and tattling. The girls took turns going into the hidden
camera room with one of the researchers—I've forgotten all their names
because I suck, so let's call her Jenny. Jenny and the girl started drawing
pictures, and then another researcher (Michelle!) came in to tell Jenny she had
a phone call. Jenny left but not before telling Michelle not to use the paper
from the book with stars on it! Only use the paper from the book with the fish
on it! Don't forget!</p>
<p>Well, you see where this is going. Sure enough, good old Michelle figured she
liked the star paper better, and drew a picture on it; then she decided she
didn't like her picture, and threw it out. After all this, Jenny came back into
the room and, after Michelle left, asked the girl what had happened when she
was away.</p>
<p>(Meanwhile Blake and I were in another room with eight thousand computers,
including the monitors for the hidden cameras. We watched the girls while
filling out a huge stack of forms and questionnaires on the girls' personalities
and our parenting styles.)</p>
<p>Delphine went first. She immediately put her head down and started working
intently on her picture. (The kids were asked to draw a picture of their
most favourite place; she drew a beach.) She didn't look up or show any
sign of noticing the researchers' exchange, to the point that Jenny was
<strong>very certain to remind Michelle loudly not to use the star paper</strong> on the way
out the door.</p>
<p>When Michelle used the star paper, Delphine didn't say anything either, and 
when Jenny later asked what had happened the exchange went something like this:</p>
<p>J: So what happened when I was gone?<br>
D: I just drew a picture.<br>
J: Did Michelle draw anything?<br>
D: Yes, she drew a picture but she threw it away.<br>
J: Did she use the star paper?<br>
D: Yes.</p>
<p>Cordelia was a little different. (Cordelia <em>is</em> a little different.) She also
set to work drawing a picture of her favourite place—she drew our house.
(*melt*) She was much more voluble and animated, though, talking through
what she was drawing and why. When Michelle came in, she looked up and
paid attention to the whole conversation. Then when Michelle started
to use the star paper, Cordelia was quick to remind her that she wasn't
supposed to use it.</p>
<p>After Jenny was back in the room, she asked Cordelia the same questions
she had asked Delphine:</p>
<p>J: So what happened when I was gone?<br>
C: I just drew my picture! (She still talks all in exclamations, with lots
of body language.)<br>
J: Did Michelle draw a picture?<br>
C: Nope!<br>
J: She didn't draw anything?<br>
C: She didn't draw anything! (This said with a great big "Who can figure?!" shrug.)</p>
<p>So Cordelia fully lied to a quasi-authority figure, to protect someone she had
barely met. It was almost just lying for the sake of it. There was a chart in
the room we were in that showed the
percentage of kids who lie from ages three to, I think, eight, and almost 100%
of six-year-olds lie. I call it "peak lying". </p>
<p>This study was interestingly timed, because I've noticed Cordelia lying more
lately.  The thing is she's much better at it than Delphine. She tends to lie
when it's plausible, and she sticks to her story, often with a touch of
righteous indignation to make you feel like a jerk for not trusting her.
Hopefully she'll either grow out of it or learn to use her power for good, not
evil.</p>
<p>After the study was over, the researchers sat everyone down and explained
what had happened, and then sent the girls on a hidden camera hunt. Delphine
revealed that she had been a bit suspicious about all the fuss over the paper,
and Cordelia looked a bit sheepish.</p>
<p>The end of the story is that the girls got to choose a gift out of a treasure
chest to thank them for participating. Delphine chose a "make your own
bouncy balls" kit, and Cordelia picked through the entire box before finally
seeing and pouncing on a ninja action figure with light-up eyes. ($1.25 at
Dollarama!)</p>

<p>Back in 2008 when we moved into this house, we secured a line of credit
to use for renovating. It was a deal we made with ourselves—we 
would spend less money on a house that wasn't "done", and then use
secure credit to fund renovations. </p>
<p>And that's exactly what we did. Soon after we moved in, we took down
some walls and totally redid the kitchen. And then we gradually paid
the loan down; not all the way, but a lot of the way. </p>
<p>Then last year we redid the bathroom and added a powder room in the basement, 
and now we're in debt again, deep enough that I'm pretty uncomfortable. 
I'm not a futurist or an economist, but I don't think now is a good time
to be deep in debt, even secured debt; jobs are scarce,
housing prices are in a <a href="http://canadabubble.com/">bubble</a>, 
and the economy is in flux. I would rather be in the black.</p>
<p>So we put together an aggressive plan to pay off debt.
It took us four months to get into debt; it's going to take us four
years to get out of it, assuming we keep to our plan. And as I said, it's
aggressive, quite probably unrealistically so; no vacations, no
household maintenance, repairs or new furniture; no clothing; no gifts
(except the girls' birthdays and Christmas); no veterinary care for Thomas the
cat.  When we spend on any of those things, it will either be from the 
$70/week not-otherwise-specified fund, or it will slow down our debt 
repayment.</p>
<p>Inevitably, mere days after making this plan, the stove and the washer
broke and Thomas had to go to the vet. </p>
<p>But we have cast off our North Toronto helplessness; instead of
calling a repairman for the appliances we consulted various websites, and there
are shiny and complicated parts being shipped here as I type. When they
get here we will get our hands greasy, or sticky, or whatever it is, and
install them ourselves.</p>
<p>(I know, the thought of amateurs messing around with water and
electricity or natural gas is alarming, but I'm confident that helpful
YouTube videos will ensure our safety.
Unfortunately there is no YouTube video for how to do expensive bloodwork
on a domestic cat, so the professionals still have the upper hand in that
one. For now.)</p>
<p>As for money in; well, Blake is making as much as is feasible at the
moment (with occasional large and surprising bonuses). Now it's up to me
to bring in some bacon of my own—or at least tofu. I took a baby
step towards that goal this week by getting an IRS EIN, a magical number
which allows me to charge Americans money. (Or more specifically, to
charge them money and not have them withhold 30% of it.) This is exciting
because so far almost all my clients have been American.</p>
<p>The other thing I'm doing is trying to fit more work hours into my week.
I had been using my "work" time (i.e., 9:00 am to 3:00 pm) to run errands
and do chores, but I've moved a few errands to the weekend and after school.
I really like my work-life balance as it is now, but the fact is when
you're freelance, only about half your hours are billable. I need to
make the number of hours as big as possible, without making myself or the 
family miserable.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think it would have been better to have bought a house which was
all renovated and shiny, and just suffered (in our shiny, renovated house)
with a bigger mortgage. But we didn't, and now we have this shabby little 
house with no family room, and a huge debt. It is what it is, and at least
we're fairly young and have a chance of pulling ourselves out of this
mess before it's time to retire!</p>

<p>Well, wasn't 2011 a piece of work? Lots of things happened, some great
and some lousy. Let's start at the beginning.</p>
<p>In January we were taking Thomas the cat to the vet for excessive skinniness,
strange loss of hair and general geriatric decrepitude. It turned out he had
fleas, some kind of allergy which was giving him red spots all over, and lots
of weird growths here and there: under his tongue, on his head, and probably in
his bowel too. We treated him for fleas and gave him antibiotics for a while to
clear up his skin problems, and put him on a permanent course of prednisone to
treat his various tumours. (He's eighteen years old, so the growths are just
because of old age.) We prepared ourselves for his imminent death; however, a full year later he's not dead yet, and indeed seems healthier than ever.</p>
<p>At the end of January Blake took off for Hawaii for work. I
wasn't invited, which was particularly galling given that, you know, Hawaii in
January. Not to mention, we hadn't been on a proper not-visiting-mum trip
since before Cordelia was born. So come March Break I decided we should go
to <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/diversions/nyadventure/day1.html">New 
York</a> for the week. That holiday was more successful and fun than I
expected it to be—the girls are at the perfect age to travel with.
(Which is a bit ironic, now that I think about it, considering we won't
have the money to go anywhere in the forseeable future.)</p>
<p>In May <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/">Greg Wilson</a> and I 
published the paperback edition of 
<a href="http://www.aosabook.org/">The Architecture of Open Source 
Applications</a> (Volume 1). In the process of publishing the book
I learned an <em>immense</em> amount about TeX, typesetting, book production
and publishing on Lulu.com, as well as getting a lead on 
a copyediting job. I enjoyed the whole process so much that I made it into a<br><a href="http://www.amyrbrown.ca/">business</a>. So far I've had a handful
of jobs and made some good connections, and I'm looking forward to
growing the business this year.</p>
<p>February through June we were in reno upheaval. Our 80-year-old plumbing
started leaking and we somehow decided, with impeccable North Toronto
logic, that the only possible solution was to put a powder room in the
basement and completely redo the upstairs bathroom. I've been meaning to
post about that... It took a long time because our contractor usually runs
much bigger jobs, and her trades were sneaking our bathroom in between
other jobs. But when it was all finally done it was very satisfying and 
lovely.</p>
<p>In the middle of June one of the kindergarten students at the girls'
school was hit by a car and killed. It shook up the staff and a lot of the 
parents pretty badly, and it's been on my mind a lot ever since. The
little girl who died was the same age as Cordelia, and she was out with
her mother when she was killed—actually her mum was hit by the car
too. Imagine the fodder for rumination and imagination and nightmares
that provided... It's a bit ridiculous that it would take something like this,
but it made me understand that the continuing existence of 
my children is a gift. Anyway, that's a whole post on its own, really.</p>
<p>At the end of June I took a plane to Tokyo (by myself) to visit Dave. I'd
never been to Japan, and it was a <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/diversions/japan#">grand</a> <a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/2011/0701/">adventure</a>.</p>
<p>By the time I got back from Japan the girls' summer vacation was well underway.
The girls were at camp for a couple of weeks, then we went to Saskatchewan
for a couple of weeks, then shortly after we came back the girls went to 
the cottage for a long weekend with Baba and Zaida. I felt like the
real mooching-around-Toronto part of summer didn't start until the middle
of August, but then we did manage to do our usual round of the Toronto
Islands, High Park, Harbourfront, and a few trips to the park. I love 
summer.</p>
<p>I have to say I don't think anything terrifically interesting has happened
since September. Greg and I have been working on the second volume of 
the software architecture book. (This time I'm actually going to copyedit
the book, which will both be fun and educational, and improve the book.) 
Cordelia likes Grade One, Delphine likes Grade Three, Cordelia likes 
gymnastics and
Delphine likes ballet. We're all pretty content to carry on into the new year
as we've been carrying on. </p>

<p>This poor blog has been sorely neglected, and especially the book blog.

<p>Santa was good for family cohesiveness this year — he brought
us lots of things to do together. Delphine got a build-your-own-catapult kit,
Cordelia got a giant puzzle of Toronto, and we got three board games.
We haven't opened the catapult or the puzzle yet, but the games have
already seen a lot of use.</p>
<h5>Apples to Apples, Jr.</h5>

<p>Apples to Apples, Jr. is one of those games that makes you feel slightly stupid
for having paid for the game and all the packaging, because there's nothing
special about the game parts that you couldn't fabricate yourself. The
creator's genius is in coming up with the game and getting it into production.
And in this case I don't feel too bad about paying for it, because it's a
really fun game.</p>
<p>What you get in the box are two sets of cards: red (nouns) and green
(adjectives). Each player gets five nouns, and one player is the judge and
selects an adjective. The non-judge players have to select from their
hand the noun which most exemplifies the chosen adjective, and submit
it without revealing which noun is theirs. Then the judge chooses—using
criteria of their own choosing—the winning noun. Players are
encouraged to advocate for their cards, and the game is more fun if
the judge deliberates out loud.</p>
<p>We've enjoyed this game every time we play it, with every age group. 
It's best for readers, but even Cordelia can play if she has someone to
help her with the words she isn't sure of. There is an adult version of the
game which I can only imagine is extremely fun.</p>
<h5>Lego Champion</h5>

<p>We have Lego Creationary, which I kind of like but I'm not really good
at Lego, so I don't love it. I wasn't sure about Lego Champion, but we 
all like it way more.</p>
<p>The board is a track made (by you) of Lego, and each turn adds another piece
to the board. Each turn also involves a challenge, a game the whole team
plays to determine who will move forward a bonus amount. </p>
<p>There are five possible challenges which vary wildly in difficulty. In
<strong>On Target</strong> everyone throws a Lego brick and tries to hit
a target.  <strong>Bluffing Bricks</strong> is a guessing game where
everyone takes three blocks and then players take turns guessing how
many of a particular colour there are, or calling the previous player's
bluff. In <strong>Topple Tower</strong> players take turns balancing a
successively larger Lego creation to the top of a tower: the first player
plays one piece, the second player plays a two-piece object, the third
plays a three-piece object, and so on. The trick is that you can't interlock
your object to the tower. The last player to add to the tower without
toppling it wins the challenge.</p>
<p>In <strong>Codebreaker</strong>, the challenger (the person whose turn
it is) makes a three-brick code, and then other players have to figure it
out by asking yes-or-no questions. And finally, in <strong>Speed 
Builder</strong> the challenger builds an eight-brick structure in secret,
and the rest of the players race to duplicate it exactly.</p>
<p>Our favourite challenges are Topple Tower and Speed Builder. Bluffing
Bricks is a little hard to understand, but once you've worked it out
it can be a clever and fascinating exercise. I think you have to be quite
a big of a game theory nerd, though; last night we played it with some
friends and it was so confusing we ended up substituting Lego bowling
when Bluffing Bricks came up on the dice. (Lego bowling is surprisingly
challenging, it turns out, because the bowling ball (the dice) is cube-shaped
and bouncy.)</p>
<p>The game play for Lego Champion is fairly quick and we've played it successfully
with ages from six to adult. (Although Cordelia tends to amuse herself between
turns by building things with the extra blocks.)</p>
<h5>Trivial Pursuit Family Edition</h5>

<p>For a long time I've imagined that it would be really nice if there were
a trivia game with different questions for kids and adults. I looked here
and there (although not on the Internet) for such a game with no luck.
At the local games shop (which is admittedly really nerdy, catering
mainly to the Chess, Go and D&amp;D crowd and only reluctantly carrying
a selection of mainstream board games) they had Nickleodeon and Disney
Trivial Pursuits which depressingly advertised, "DVD Included! No reading! 
No adult participation required!" Well thank goodness for that.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise when I found Trivial Pursuit Family Edition at
Toys! Toys! Toys!, the second tackiest toy store in town. It is exactly
as I imagined it, Trivial Pursuit with two sets of cards, one for
kids and one for adults. The board is changed slightly to speed up
game-play: half of the "roll again" spaces are now shortcuts to 
pie spaces, but even so Delphine and I have found that our two-person
games drag on a little. </p>
<p>The kid questions are pitched perfectly for a well-read eight-year-old, so 
Delphine really enjoys it and gives me a run for my money. I am not
sure how well this game would go over for a kid who doesn't read a lot
or watch a lot of education TV.  Cordelia basically can't play
because there's too much reading and she doesn't know enough yet,
although she has a nice time being on someone's team, for a while
at least.</p>
<p>My only problem with this game is that it's American and the
questions are heavily skewed to American history and geography. I
suppose it's too much to ask that there be a Trivial Pursuit Canadian
Family Edition...</p>

<p>I haven't posted about the girls for ages because Delphine's not totally
comfortable with being the subject of a blog any more. I guess if you want to
get to know Delphine better you'll have to either meet her or wait until she
starts her own blog. But I might sneak in the odd post, like this one.</p>
<p>This week Delphine started Grade Three and Cordelia started Grade One.
Cordelia wasn't excited about starting Grade One until a few days before, when
her sister convinced her it would be fun. Delphine has had Cordelia firmly
under her wing since school started: they entered the first day fray together
(with strict instructions to us to stay out of the way) and they have been
meeting up at recess and sharing snacks. </p>
<p>Both girls love their respective teachers. Delphine is in a 2/3 split which
seems like it's going to be an awesome class. Cordelia is in a 1/2 split – I'm
not sure who is in that class but I really like the teacher so I think it will
be a good year for her, too.</p>
<p>More generally, Cordelia is still clinging to her baby status. She doesn't like
to read, although I think she reads better than she likes to let on.  She also
flat-out refused to learn to ride a bike this summer, although she's learning
to go like stink on the scooter to keep up with Big Sister. I'm curious to see
what being in Grade One will do for her carefully maintained aura of
incompetence. I'm pretty sure she steps up and shows her abilities when she's
at school, and I think soon she's going to have to accept that we know that she
can do stuff.</p>
<p>Cordelia has always had an affinity for numbers (as I expect I've mentioned)
and her report card last year said "Cordelia shows an avid interest in math".
I'm curious to see how that interest develops in Grade One's more advanced
math.</p>
<p>Cordelia's my little maker. Her catchphrase is "I could use that for
something!", whenever I try to throw away some interesting box or widget. And
indeed, if I let her have the thing she will cut it up and glue some other bits
to it and transform it into a building or a slide or a cat or some other
creation. I so want to take her to a Maker Faire.</p>
<p>Around about when she turned eight Delphine transformed from a little kid into
a pre-adolescent. I used to think "tween" was a nonsense marketing category,
but there's a marked difference between seven and eight. She's got a new
spirit, a little bit of sassiness and attitude, but not in a bad way; she's
still polite and civil (mostly) but she's got opinions.  A few of her rants:
"Why do they change everything when they make movies out of books?!" (with a
subrant: "'How to Train Your Dragon' was nothing like the book!"); "Everyone
thinks Canadians live in igloos!"; "Why does everyone drive everywhere?!"; and
one of my favourites, "Everyone else has a nice basement, why is ours is all
gross?!" She's going through a bit of a noisy, self-righteous phase which, if
she doesn't grow out of it, will serve her well on the Internet (or in the
Computer Science Club) some day. But it all comes from noticing the greater
world and realizing that there are different ways to be in it, and trying to
work out what your choices say about you.</p>
<p>This year she's starting ballet, which will hopefully teach her 
self-discipline and maybe some humility (unless she turns out to be really
good at it). She's still enjoying piano, and she's taking an art class
with Cordelia. Perhaps a little overscheduled; we'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>The sad thing is, I wasn't all that hungry when I was in Japan.  Normally I
love to eat but I couldn't get excited about food, probably because of the heat
and humidity. It's terribly ironic, to me, to go all that way to somewhere
where I'd normally want to stuff my face and then not being interested.
Fortunately I was hanging out with a person with a normal appetite, so we ate
regularly and interestingly anyway. (If I had been by myself I might have just
survived on bread and fruit juice, and that would have been a pity.)</p>
<p>My first meal in Japan was dinner: <strong>okonomiyaki</strong> at a cook-it-yourself restaurant
near Ameyayokocho, with Dave and his friend Robert. We had a kind of
miscellaneous omelette, fried enoki mushrooms in butter (<em>so</em> good!) and some
sautéed greens. The greens came in their own little soup of cornstarchy
sauce, which you are supposed to add gradually to the greens. After you have
cooked the greens and sauce, you add a bunch of cheese, which suddenly changes
the whole thing from sautéed greens to fried cheese with bits of greens. Tasty.</p>
<p>We also had a couple of flagons of <strong>Japan's Default Beer</strong>. You go into a
restaurant and order "beer" and they bring you "beer", a glass mug of a
cold, easy-drinking lager with a good inch of head on it.  (Usually Asahi
Super-Dry or Kirin Lager, I think.) It was the perfect drink in that weather,
and Dave and I had one with almost every meal.</p>
<p><img src="../images/amy/japan/breakfast.jpg" alt="Japanese Breakfast" align="left">
For the next morning's breakfast I had ordered the "<strong>Japanese breakfast</strong>" at my
<a href="http://www.sakura-ryokan.com/english/ehome.html">ryokan</a>, and I was
eager to find out what it entailed. It turned out to be rice, miso soup, some
lightly-pickled sliced cucumber, steamed greens in a sweet sesame sauce,
scrambled egg with tomato and orange on the side, and some grilled fish. Also
green tea and a little package of nori. It was a lot of food and I didn't
finish everything, which I'm sure is either completely insulting or totally
acceptable. The fish was delicious: mild and slightly crispy on the outside.</p>
<p><img src="../images/amy/japan/tinyshrimp.jpg" alt="Tiny shrimp sushi" align="right">
For lunch that day I decided we should have <strong>sushi</strong>, since that's the
quintessential Japanese food in my mind. Dave found us a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conveyor_belt_sushi">conveyor belt sushi</a>
place where we had eel, salmon, tuna, tiny fish, tiny shrimp, and plenty more. </p>
<p>Later that afternoon we wandered to Harajuku, where the street eat of choice is
crepes. This is curious because there aren't really any other street eats in
Japan, apart from the odd soft-serve ice cream place — walking while eating
just isn't done — but for some reason it's acceptable to eat a filled crepe
folded into a cone while walking around Harajuku.  I had <strong>ice cream, chocolate
syrup and whipped cream in my crepe</strong>; I think Dave had bananas or apples in
syrup or something similar. (Dave has lost lots of weight since moving to Japan
by eating carefully and walking a lot; I think he must have had to eat even
more carefully and walk even more after I left to make up for sharing my bad
habits while I was there.)</p>
<p>For dinner that evening we went to a (chain?) restaurant which offered
a variety of food: garlic cheese bread, pizza, shrimp chips, chicken.
We had some gyoza and an <strong>assorted yakitori plate</strong> (grilled chicken parts on sticks; mmm, chicken kidneys). I think we also had something with cheese, but it's
hard for me to say because I was rocking some serious jet lag and pretty
much falling asleep on my plate.</p>
<p>Next day's Japanese breakfast was about the same, but with salmon instead
of the mystery white fish.</p>
<p><img src="../images/amy/japan/ramen.jpg" alt="Ramen" align="left">
We had <strong>ramen</strong> for lunch in Fujisawa, on the way to Enoshima. It was
a rustic little restaurant, staffed only by two cooks behind the bar. You order
by selecting and paying for your dish from a machine, then giving the
resulting receipt to the cooks.  It was delicious: the meat was tender,
the noodles were soft with that particular chewiness you only get from
freshly made noodles, and the broth was savoury and rich. (I wish I had
been as hungry when I had it in front of me as I am now writing about it.
Irony!)</p>
<p>It was on Enoshima that we had the <strong>mango softserve ice cream</strong> that I
posted about earlier. It was almost like a mango sorbet, with enough
creaminess to make it luxurious without cutting the refreshing fruitiness
of the mango. Served in a twist ("mix") with vanilla it was like a
creamsicle all grown up.</p>
<p>After Enoshima we went on a long train ride to a yakitori restaurant run by
some friends of Dave's. We could have ridden the whole way in a standard JR
train car, like a fancier subway car, but there's an option on JR (the rail
company) to take a "Green car", a sort of first-class which is more like a
double-decker GO train car — cushy reclining seats with a tray, and drink
and snack service (with <em>very</em> cheap beer!)</p>
<p><img src="../images/amy/japan/sink.jpg" alt="Sink" align="right">
The restaurant was like a pub, kind of dark and medieval with low ceilings and
lots of wood. (Never mind the high-tech powered sliding door which are all-but
ubiquitous in stores and restaurants.)  The sink in the picture gives you an
idea of the rough-hewn feel of the place.</p>
<p>Once again the food was delicious: we had grilled bits and pieces on sticks,
<strong>mostly-raw chicken</strong> (I wasn't up for more than a taste of that), and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiyayakko"><strong>hiyayakko</strong></a>,
sliced tofu with soy sauce and fish flakes. (A.k.a., "That cold shit.", as
Dave thinks of it.) Also more beer.</p>
<p>For Sunday's breakfast I requested "Western-style", as much because I wanted
to see what they would do with it as because I craved familiar food. 
<strong>"Western-style" breakfast</strong> turns out to include back bacon, scrambled egg,
a giant slab of toasted white bread, tomato and some orange. Also penne
with sweet tomato sauce, and steamed broccoli. Of course.</p>

We had lunch at a chain <strong>tonkatsu</strong> restaurant called Wako. I had a combo with
pork medallions, a shrimp and some pumpkin, all breaded and deep-fried, as well
as a haystack of shredded cabbage and the usual miso soup and bowl of white
rice.  There was a side of mayo, for what I'm not sure (I made the cabbage into
coleslaw with it). Also <strong>chawan mushi</strong>, a savoury custard. The tonkatsu was
crispy and delicious and the pile of cabbage was a refreshing change from the
analogous pile of french fries you would get on this side of the Pacific.  It,
as well as the miso soup (I think) were bottomless — you could hail the
waitress and she would come over with a enormous bowl of shredded cabbage and
pile another stack of it on your plate.</p>
<p>Having had a tasty plate of deep fried for lunch, we set out vaguely in search
of something healthy for dinner. I moved to a hotel in Saitama on Sunday, so we
were in Saitama for dinner, and had a choice of the usual suspects: ramen,
sushi, and so on. We eventually talked each other into <strong>Korean barbeque</strong> and
decided to be healthy another day.</p>
<p>Most Japanese restaurants have pictures of all the dishes they offer, but the
interesting thing about Korean barbeque is that the food in the pictures is
still raw. I guess that's not the most interesting thing — the most
interesting thing is that the food they bring to your table is still raw. Each
table is fitted with its very own little fire pit, some intrepid young man
comes by with a bucket of hot coals and skillfully sets it into place, and then
you use cunning little tongs to cook everything to your taste. We had some
delicious strips of beef and placated the gods of healthy eating by roasting up
some assorted veggies.</p>
<p>There was no breakfast at my hotel in Saitama, so on Monday morning I ventured
out on my own to find something to eat. It seems like an odd choice, but I
found it at 7/11. They have a decent selection of cellophane-wrapped pastries,
so I bought <strong>brioche sort of thing</strong>, and added a can of delicious <strong>Boss
Caffe Latte</strong> from the vending machine in the hotel lobby.</p>
<p>Lunch led us on an epic train journey to Utsonomiya, the world's
gyoza capital, for (that's right) gyoza. We went to a tiny restaurant
and ordered their <em>special plate of 12 gyoza</em>*, all different (and beer!) There
were pork, shrimp, chicken, kim chee, pork and shiso, and some more which
were delicious but not readily identifiable. (I actually left the kim chee
dumpling; it was just too spicy for lightweight me — Dave helped
me out with it.)</p>
<p>(The more I write this post the sadder I am that I had no appetite to speak of
while I was in Tokyo. Everything was good but it would have been even better if
I had been hungry.)</p>
<p>By dinner time I was craving a Pickle Barrel big salad. I don't know what it
says about me that when I'm in a foreign country full of exotic, delicious food
I crave the most pedestrian Western food, but there it is. All I desired was a
giant bowl of crispy iceberg lettuce, ham, eggs, and chicken smothered in some
unctuous dressing. There is about 0% chance of finding that anywhere in Tokyo,
let alone Saitama. We wandered around sussing out various restaurants and
finally chose an odd little second-floor pub, advertising $3 beer in the
window.  (We weren't sure whether $3 beer was a good sign or not, food-wise,
but we figured at least it meant there would be $3 beer.)</p>
<p>The place was decorated in a blackened-wood and fishing nets motif. We got
ourselves a beer, and ordered what might be the closest thing to my big salad
you'd find in Tokyo: a <strong>green salad with sashimi</strong>. It was delicious, and hit
the spot. We also had <strong>shrimp and cheese sticks</strong> — shrimp with cheese
rolled in an egg roll wrapper and fried — and I think Dave ordered some
other stuff I either didn't try or tried and didn't remember.</p>
<p><img src="../images/amy/japan/egg.jpg" alt="Individually wrapped boiled egg" align="right">
On Tuesday my 7/11 breakfast was a <strong>boiled egg (individually wrapped)</strong>
and a <strong>Georgia Iced Coffee</strong>. I thought the Georgia Iced Coffee would be pretty
much the same as the Boss Iced Coffee, but it was much more bitter and
metallic-tasting. I learned from Dave, later, that all the different
iced coffee brands have distinctive flavours, and I just lucked into the
one I like best first try.</p>
<p>We were down at Tokyo Bay at lunchtime — I wanted to check out Tokyo's
"Harbourfront". There's a big mall down there (Doug Ford take note!) and
they were having some kind of ramen festival in one of the food courts.  (Or
else one of the food courts was set up to simulate a perpetual ramen festival;
now that I think about it I'm not quite sure which.) I had a hankering for eel,
so I ordered something which looked like a delicious bowl of ramen with eel on
top. Turns out the colour reproduction on the picture was a little off, and I
got a delicious bowl of <strong>ramen with two slices of boiled bacon on top</strong>. (Dave
tells me it was Okinawa-style ramen, which is of course different from the
various other kinds of ramen.) I know boiled bacon sounds disgusting, but it
was smoky and tender. I expect if you tried boiling Canadian mass market bacon
it would fall apart or go slimy, but I think if you got good bacon from a
butcher it would boil up nicely. Try it in soup!</p>
<p>I also had some <strong>melon soda</strong>. Melon is a big flavour over there, although it
seemed more vaguely fruity than tasting of any melon I'm familiar with.</p>
<p>After we walked around the waterfront some more we had <strong>kakigori</strong>, which
is like a sno-cone or granita or whatever they call flavoured ice where
you are. I chose Blue Hawaii flavour, which is... blue. And sweet. It
was delicious, just the thing to eat while sitting by the water and
sweating gently.</p>
<p>Our next stop was Tokyo Tower, where I had a piece of <strong>cheesecake</strong> at
the restaurant up top. Cheesecake seems to be quite popular in Tokyo, and
I was curious as to how it was interpreted. It was softer and smoother
than a New York-style cheesecake, and had a nice sharp cream cheesy bite.</p>
<p>Dinner was fancy, at the Chou Chou Dinning Room (not to be confused
with Tony's Fine Dinning, a roti place up on Sheppard). Like many restaurants
in Tokyo, it was on the second floor — Tokyoites don't have our 
aversion to going up a level or two to eat or shop. The restaurant
was beautiful; we entered on a transparent walkway over a mock riverbed
of white stones. Shiny dark wood and elegant lighting set a mood of
quiet refinement.</p>
<p>Keeping with the classy style of the place, I refrained from ordering my
usual beer and had a <strong>grapefruit sour</strong> instead.  We ordered <strong>chicken
gyoza</strong> and <strong>little fish baked in phyllo</strong>, with the
heads still on. But the highlight of the meal was the <strong>risotto</strong>, a creamy
sweet-savoury delight.</p>
<p>Wednesday was my last day in Tokyo. My final 7/11 breakfast was a <strong>green
bun filled with cantaloupe-flavoured custard</strong>. Why was it green?
Green tea? Melon? Mint? It's hard to say, and the flavour wasn't much
help. The custard was delicious, though, and not something I'm likely
to ever get in Toronto. I also had a tub of yogurt in a vague attempt
to eat some protein, and, sadly, my last can of Boss Caffe Latte.</p>
<p>Dave and I decided that my last meal in Tokyo should be the iconic <strong>conveyor
belt sushi</strong>, so for lunch we ducked into a really cheap little place. 
It was fascinating — they had laid out the restaurant so that the
conveyor belt wound round into every cranny of the odd-shaped room, so it
formed an irregular, jagged L-shape and we had to shuffle sideways behind half
the other diners to get to our chairs. </p>
<p>I didn't realize how cheap the place was until Dave pointed out they were
serving fake wasabi.  But even the cheapest saddest Tokyo sushi is still fresh
and delicious; really, the only thing that distinguished it from more expensive
sushi was that the rolls were slightly misshapen. We had the usual selection of
tuna, salmon, and clam. Dave scooped himself a plate of natto sushi, and I had
some alarmingly tacky shrimp salad sushi, while I amused myself trying to think
what you could serve conveyor-belt style in a Canadian restaurant: sandwiches?
Salads? It's such a great way to have lunch: fast, fresh and cheap.</p>
<p>My very last Japanese food purchase was a can of <strong>peach soda</strong> from a
vending machine in the airport. Even though I was only there for a week, the
idea of Japanese vending machines has lodged itself in my brain, to the
extent that whenever I go to a public park in Toronto I'm always briefly
disappointed that I can't buy myself a can of coffee or a soda from a handy
vending machine.</p>
<p>I love eating in other countries; you learn so much about a place from what and
how they eat. I loved the little plates, which allow you to try lots of
different things, and to eat as much as you like and no more. I liked the way
everyone orders together and shares the food. I think the Japanese custom of
not eating while walking is healthy and sensible (although it would take me
more than a week to get out of the habit). And I liked the food itself:
everything (apart from my 7/11 delights) was freshly made from excellent
ingredients. Tokyo is a great destination if you like to eat.</p>
