<p>(Probably Not Actually Everything)</p>
<h4>Boston</h4>
<p>This week I went to Boston for a two-day <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/2013-06-wise.html">work
thing</a>, which I will not discuss at length lest this gets linked as
some kind of relevant post and too many work people start reading it, which I
don't mind but makes me feel weird about posting boring crap about my kids and
my hair. Anyway, yeah, Boston. I didn't get to do much interesting touristy
stuff but I had fun and would visit again. </p>
<p>(I should point out that I wasn't ever in Boston, except when
I was at the airport — I was in Cambridge.)</p>
<p>I got there on Sunday afternoon and right away went to <a href="http://www.bjs.com/">BJ's</a> with my infinitely patient Boston friends
to get snacks for the boot camp.  After we unloaded the snacks at <a href="http://www.whitmanhouseinn.com/">the B&amp;B</a> we went for dinner at <a href="http://www.cambrew.com/">Cambridge Brewing Company</a>, which my friends
kept confusingly referring to as <a href="http://www.cbc.ca">CBC</a>. I had the
cheese plate (cheeeeese) and I want to say a salad but I don't recognize any of
the salads on the menu. It was tasty and satisfying. I also had the
HefeWeizen (which I now realize I was pronouncing wrong, for shame, haven't I
sung enough Bach?) which hit the spot.</p>
<p>We walked over to <a href="http://www.tosci.com/">Toscanini's Ice Cream</a>
where I had Ovaltine, and Peanut Butter and Honey.  Ovaltine ice cream is a wonderful and necessary thing. The Tosci's ice cream was good, but I have to say it's no better than the good ice cream places in Toronto. Sorry, I know that's kind of a jerky thing to say.</p>
<p>Then I said goodbye and many thanks to my friends, and oddly enough went back
to CBC, where I met up with some boot camp instructors and helpers, and
drank more beer (a Saisonniere, which I did pronounce properly).</p>
<p>I worked the next two days. On Monday night we had a catered
dinner at the boot camp, so I didn't even eat out. (Catered dinner is good
too! Such a treat to have someone turn up and make everything right,
with wine!) Tuesday morning I had to go to a supermarket and buy another
cartload of snacks because apparently people are way hungrier than I 
thought.</p>
<p>The boot camp ended on Tuesday afternoon and I went for a drink at <a href="http://www.catalystrestaurant.com/">Catalyst</a> with a couple of
instructors and helpers. The bathrooms were fancy!  Then I went walking around
Harvard with a new friend before a late dinner at <a href="http://www.thekebabfactory.net">The Kebab Factory</a> (goat curry! gulab
jamun!). We talked about the supposed advantages of name-brand universities,
and national identity, and immigrant identity, and walkable neighbourhoods. It
was one of those great conversations.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.whitmanhouseinn.com">B&amp;B</a> was fabulous —
clean and beautiful, and the proprietors and staff were delightful company.
If I ever go back to Cambridge I will definitely stay there.</p>
<h4>First Day of Summer Vacation Didn't Go Well</h4>
<p>Friday — yesterday — was the first day of summer vacation. Well, as
a friend kindly pointed out, yesterday was technically a PA day, and Monday is
a statutory holiday, so the first day of summer vacation is Tuesday.  This is
good because it gives me a chance to not foreshadow a terrible
summer.</p>
<p>I woke up with a hideous headache and a mild but nagging nausea. Like a
hangover without the fun. I took some ibuprofen and drank some tea,
but it didn't get better so I gave up and went back to bed while the
children did I-don't-know-what. When I woke up at 11:30 I felt mostly okay and
what was left of the headache seemed vanquishable by drugs, so I took some and
dragged the girls downtown to the office; I needed to talk to Greg about
the boot camp and some other stuff.</p>
<p>The office was the best part of the day. We had lunch there and saw some people,
and the girls got to play with Post-it notes and the white board.</p>
<p>As we left the office it started raining, and after we went to Winners
for a failed attempt to buy socks for the girls everything was quite soggy.
On the way into the subway at St Andrew I warned the girls to be very careful
because the stairs were slippery. And then I fell down them. </p>
<p>You know the
part in <em>Lord of the Rings</em> where Legolas slides down the stairs at Helm's 
Deep on a shield? It was like that, but instead of a shield, my butt. 
Apart from that it was the same, with the rain and the orcs. Or maybe those
were commuters. </p>
<p>Somehow I righted myself at the bottom of the stairs, accepted sympathy from
friendly orcs and limped on.  No serious damage, I think, but some nasty
bruises, and new pains every time I move. I seem to have done something clever
with my left arm on my way down, although I'm not sure what. I was
trying very hard to stop falling and apparently my left arm wanted to help. And
failed.</p>
<p>The exciting news is that my back is not busted up. So far.</p>
<h4>School</h4>
<p>As pointed out above, school's out for summer. I guess we had a pretty good
year. C's teacher was fantastic and just right for her: sweet and
gentle but insistent and with high standards. C's reading has improved
and so has her stick-to-it-iveness and focus, and most importantly 
she enjoyed school despite her moaning.</p>
<p>D's year was harder, although not catastrophic. Not even terrible. I've
already blogged about the problems she had, and the good news is there's a change
coming: she's been offered a place at a new gifted program. Well, kind
of — she was offered an opportunity to express interest in being
offered a place at the new gifted program, supposing that there are enough
other kids expressing interest to make it worth starting up said program.</p>
<p>We were only given one evening to decide (though really we had had weeks to
think about the <em>idea</em> of going to a gifted program, I didn't want to dwell on
it too much until we had a more concrete offer, so we hadn't made a decision
yet).  D didn't know how to decide, so she sat on the kitchen <a href="http://www.simplehuman.com/30-litre-retro-step-can-red-steel">garbage
can</a> with a sheet of paper and we listed the pros and cons of each decision
while I made dinner. And finally, tearfully, she said she would go to the
program so long as she could have two playdates with her best friend from her
old school every week.</p>
<p>I'm pretty excited to be joining a new program. For some reason there has
been a surge of applicants to the gifted program this year, and I'm hoping that that means
that a) the new program will be mostly filled with new applicants, and b)
the new applicants will have a better proportion of girls than the existing
gifted population. That's kind of an optimistic assumption, because I have
no idea why there have been so many applicants this year. I suppose it could be that there has been a surge in insufferable gifted boys and the teachers want to get rid of them all. Either way, it will be nice to be there
for the first year of a new program — at the
very least D won't be joining a crowd of kids who already know each other.</p>
<p>I'm a bit sad that she won't be able to walk to school and back with C next
year, and that she won't be able to be in the school choir that I volunteer
with. Okay, I'm very sad about that. But it didn't seem like enough reason
to keep her from this opportunity.</p>
<p>I'm bad at wrapping up blog posts. The End.</p>

<p>In order to go to the Write the Docs conference that I wrote about
in my last post, you might suppose, correctly, that I had to go to 
Portland, Oregon.
My last adventure was my trip to <a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/2011/0701/">Japan</a> in 2011, so I was ready to
get away.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to get from Toronto to Portland; I chose to 
go via Vancouver on Air Canada because I heard from Twitter that, while
Air Canada is bad, the American airlines are worse. 
As usual, I didn't have any trouble with Air Canada and arrived in Vancouver
only slightly cramped and squashed.</p>
<p>We flew into a storm on the way from Vancouver to Portland, and when we were
almost there the plane got hit by lightning. I wasn't terribly happy about that;
I couldn't think of a time I had heard about planes being hit by lightning and
it ending well. The pilot didn't seem bothered, though, and apart from some
turbulence and the people behind me panicking, we landed without a problem.</p>
<p>Portland was warm and moist and smelled wonderful. I got a ride to the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_deLuxe">Hotel
deLuxe</a> from an Internet friend, and we had a chance to gossip and talk to
her
little guy about Superman and the fact that he couldn't reach his bits of paper
with "S" on them.</p>
<p>The Hotel deLuxe was built in 1912 and recently restored with a 
vintage movie theme. It's a luxurious old-timey hotel like a smaller King Eddy.
My room had floor-to-ceiling velvet drapes, crystal deco-style light fixtures,
and white subway tile in the bathroom. The bed was furnished with thick, heavy
sheets and more pillows than I knew what to do with. (So, more than two.) 
There was
also a pillow menu, so you could order an even better pillow than
the umpteen already there, and a holy book menu so you could request any one of
about twelve holy books. I approve of the breaking of the Gideon hegemony.</p>
<p>After I got settled in I decided to go for a walk to wind down after travelling
all day. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powell%27s_Books">Powell's Book
Store</a> was nearby, labelled as an attraction on the hotel map, and open late,
so that was my destination. </p>
<p>The area around
the hotel was dead at that time of night; there are some offices, a church, a
theatre with nothing going on.
Obviously I wasn't familiar with the neighbourhood so I didn't know
how nervous to be, but there were a few women walking around and biking alone,
so I decided not to be nervous. After a couple of blocks I came to Burnside
Street, which was a little livelier.</p>
<p>Powells is astonishing. It's a multi-storey used book store which covers an
entire block; it's a shrine to books. I could have spent the whole weekend
there, but I managed to escape after about an hour and a half with only a few
books and a couple of gifts for the girls.</p>
<p>The next day was the conference, which I already talked about <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/work/writeTheDocs.html">over here</a>. I woke
up early (still being on EST, three hours earlier than local time), worked
out in the hotel's small-but-effective gym, then had a proper cooked breakfast
in the hotel restaurant. (I don't know why, but hotel breakfasts are the height
of luxury and self-indulgence to me.) </p>
<p>I walked to the conference site in plenty of time, so when I got there the
doors weren't open yet. There was a short line of grumpy-looking people waiting
to get in (and <a href="http://howtowriteeverything.com/marcia-riefer-johnston-bio/">one
person</a> who looked pleased to be there). I was happy and well-rested so I
didn't want to stand in a grumpy line, but I wasn't feeling outgoing enough to
talk to the one happy person, so I went for a walk around the block instead.</p>
<p>By the time I got back the doors to the Mission Theater were open. It's
another old building (Portland doesn't seem to have Toronto's love
of knocking old buildings down): a <a href="http://www.mcmenamins.com/210-mission-theater-home">theatre</a> with a balcony and a bar. </p>
<p>As I said in the other post, the conference was great. We were served lunch and
there was an open bar (!). The line for lunch was really long, so to pass the
time I had a beer; the first day I asked for something "not too bitter"
(because I know Americans love really bitter ales); the drink the bartender
served me was delicious and indeed not too bitter, so I asked what it was: a
Nebraska Bitter. Good thing I let him choose.</p>
<p>I took a break from the conference and walked down a few blocks to get
a coffee from Barista — some of the people at the conference
suggested it as the best local coffee place. (It was delicious and, after
three days I'm officially spoiled for non-awesome coffee.) I also 
stumbled on <a href="http://www.oblationpapers.com/">Oblation Papers</a>,
a paper and print shop with beautiful, quirky handmade cards. Like so
many places in Portland, the store is just the front desk for a tiny
factory — they actually make the paper right on site. There's also
a budgie.</p>
<p>I really like Portland. I don't really understand how the economy of Portland
works because there seem to be lots of businesses which employ people
to make things by hand, and sell the things for reasonable price. You can
get vegan food everywhere, and wherever you can buy coffee, you can also
buy beer. </p>
<p>Monday night the conference organizers had some events planned; a night at a <a href="http://groundkontrol.com/">video game arcade</a> (with infinite
quarters), and a couple of informal gatherings nearby, at a beer place and a
coffee place. The video game arcade had dozens, if not hundreds, of video games
and pinball games, but nothing that appealed to me (unsurprisingly — I
have never liked video games).  They had DDR but no-one was playing. I ended up
going around the corner to the coffee place — not only coffee, but beer
and computers you could rent time on — but there was no-one from the
conference there. I was tired and hungry anyway, so I had a plate of nachos,
read Twitter and went back to the hotel.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I tried World Cup Coffee, which was better than Starbucks but not as
good as good Portland coffee (told you I'm spoiled). They were experiencing a
small fire in one of their coffee roaster, but they managed to make me a coffee
anyway.</p>
<p>Wednesday morning I woke up even earlier, packed, and had
another fancy hotel breakfast.
Then I caught the Max train (just around the corner from the hotel) and rode
all the way to the airport without a single transfer. <em>So awesome!</em> I
wish I lived in a non-world-class city that had decent transit to the
airport.</p>
<p>I entirely failed to get any good gifts for my cat-sitters, so I hoped I would
be able to get something at the airport.  I was lucky; turns out the Portland
airport has <em>awesome</em> retail, including a store called <a href="http://www.madeinoregon.com/">Made in Oregon</a> which has a great
selection of interesting, actually-local food and gifts. I got hazelnuts, tea,
chocolate and saltwater taffy for the folks back home.</p>

<p>This week I went to the first-ever Write the Docs conference.
Write the Docs, as I understand it, intends to create a community
of the people who write documentation for open source projects. There are
plenty of professional groups for technical writers, 
and plenty of communities online and off for open source developers, but
open source documentarians (a made-up word) exist in an awkward nether-world,
neither corporate and well-trained like professional tech writers nor,
well, reluctant to write documentation like open source developers.</p>
<p>That awkward nether-world was embodied in Portland last Monday and Tuesday.
The <a href="http://conf.writethedocs.org/#crew">geniuses</a> who put the
conference together booked an <a href="http://docs.writethedocs.org/en/2013/conference/venue.html">old
theatre</a>, gathered a diverse group of <a href="http://conf.writethedocs.org/#speakers">speakers</a> of various levels of
seasonedness (another made-up word), sold 220 tickets to a yet-more diverse*
group of people and put us all together in a room for two days to soak up each
other's stories, ideas and passion. </p>
<p>(* Diverse in interests, experience, and gender, but not race; the group in the
Mission Theatre was almost as white as Portland itself.)</p>
<p>In a stroke of inspiration, the organizers managed to get enough
sponsorship to not only feed us but provide an open bar — that's
right, I said an open bar — every afternoon. Which is nice, but I'm sorry
to say I can now never go to another conference unless there is free booze
every day starting at noon.</p>
<p>There were twenty-seven talks altogether, as well as some <em>ad hoc</em> lightning
talks. They will all be available on YouTube but so far they are not sorted or
tagged, just listed under the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NextDayVideo">account of the company</a>
that did the videoing.</p>
<p>Here is my list of standout talks from the conference:</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Butterick's <a href="http://youtu.be/8J6HuvosP0s">Typography for
Docs</a></strong> (NSFW: swearing) didn't teach me a whole lot (which is good
considering typography is one of the many things I charge money for) but
Matthew is charismatic, funny, and opinionated. And I love that he didn't have
a slideshow, he just clicked around some tabs in a browser window. </p>
<p>Matthew outlined four important decisions in typography:</p>
<ol>
<li>Font choice (he likes Charis, Charter, and Adobe Source Sans for the web)</li>
<li>Font size (smaller than you think for print; bigger than you think for 
   the web)</li>
<li>Line length (between two and three lowercase alphabets per line)</li>
<li>Line spacing (between 120% and 145% of font height)</li>
</ol>
<p>(I know, this blog fails terribly at at least two of those. Cmd-shift-=!)
Among other things, he warned us to be careful of misuse of emphasis;
anything dark catches the eye, so you don't want a lot of darkness in
your navigation — save it for headers and other clues to document
structure.</p>
<p>Matthew Butterick wrote a <a href="http://www.typographyforlawyers.com/">book</a> called <em>Typography for
Lawyers</em> which I will probably buy.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Hale's <a href="http://youtu.be/mBRCq-AvYmU">Getting Developers 
and Engineers to Write the Docs</a></strong> is misleadingly titled;
it is really more about customer support and retention than
documentation, although documentation plays a part in both those things. The
punchline is that at Wufoo they got developers (and everyone else in the
company) to answer the tech support phone. My favourite line: "After the second
or third ring of that phone, with the exact same problem, the engineer will
stop what they're doing, fix the problem, and you don't get phone calls for it
anymore." (That's a paraphrase of a Paul English line.)</p>
<p><strong>Marcia Johnston's Write Tight(er) —</strong> (no video yet) was about
how to write concisely, with the right number of words and no
more. She argues that wordiness is bad when paying for translation and
when people are reading on small screens, but editors everywhere know
that concise writing is easier to read and comprehend.</p>
<p>Marcia provided a list of ways to write tighter. Get rid of:</p>
<ul>
<li>variations on "to be"</li>
<li>-ly words and other flabby adjectives</li>
<li>"very", "just", "such", "so", and "really"</li>
<li>negative constructions</li>
<li>"begin to" and "start to"</li>
<li>(or be suspicious of) "of"-phrases: "in light of", "in spite of"</li>
<li>"proverbial"</li>
<li>"different" in "many different" or "three different"-type constructs</li>
<li>the passive voice</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, with all these guidelines the rule is to apply them,
unless it's better that you don't. Oh, English.</p>
<p>Marcia's book, <a href="http://howtowriteeverything.com/">Word Up!</a>,
will be available on April 27; I'll probably buy it, too.</p>
<p><strong>Nóirín Plunkett</strong> (or <a href="https://twitter.com/noirinp">Pluincéid on
Twitter</a>, but I guess that's just too open to mangling) did a talk  called
<strong>Text Lacks Empathy</strong> (also not posted yet). It's about how to put the emotion
back into casual written communication.  </p>
<p>Nóirín had some lovely metaphors. Being social is, for introverts like her,
like working in a virtual machine; she can still do all the usual things, but
it takes a little more processing time. Tact is like a filter: some people
apply it on their output; some people apply it on input from others. If it's
not applied on either end (i.e., if someone assumes the listener will apply
tact on input and so doesn't apply it on output), offense can result.
Similarly, if tact is applied on output <em>and</em> input, content can be lost.</p>
<p>She also pointed out that in an emotional void we tend to assume negative
emotion. That is, if you haven't heard anything specific about someone's
emotional state for a while, you tend to assume that they're angry or annoyed
at you.</p>
<p>Nóirín had some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand expectations: where is the tact filter generally expected
  to be applied in your organization or relationship?</li>
<li>Zero is not negative: don't assume that no emotional communication
  implies negative feelings. If in doubt, ask, and always assume good
  intent.</li>
<li>They don't know how you feel: you have add emotional content to
  your writing in a way you don't have to add it to face-to-face
  communication. Express your emotional state with words, use emoticons,
  or change to a more emotion-rich communication channel:
  email &lt; IRC &lt; voice &lt; video &lt; real life.</li>
<li>Perception is reality: if someone feels attacked, it doesn't matter
  what your intent was, they will react as if they have <em>been</em> attacked.
  You have to deal with their emotional state first, before you can
  return to the content of your conversation.</li>
<li>Active isn't always better than passive: take advantage of English's
  passive voice: "You broke the build" is aggressive and causes
  those emotions that you then have to deal with; "The build broke" allows
  everyone to save face and get on with fixing the problem.</li>
<li>If it doesn't matter, do it their way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately Nóirín ran out of time and didn't get to talk about 
the last points in her slide show — I'd like to see the whole
talk sometime.</p>
<p>It struck me that many of Nóirín's points apply to parenting.
When you're dealing with an upset child, you do have to manage their
emotions before you can teach, discipline or advise; they literally
cannot take in any information while they're upset.  (As my nanny
told my mother once, "They can't hear you when you shout at them.")</p>
<p>Assuming good intent is vital; it's one of
Alfie Kohn's <a href="http://rainbowrecognizer.hubpages.com/hub/10-Principles-of-Unconditional-Parenting">10 Principles of Unconditional Parenting</a>.
And finally, "if it doesn't matter, do it their way" is another way
of putting one of parenting's most important mantras, "pick your
battles wisely".</p>
<p>I have no idea if Nóirín has written a book, but I'm sure she will eventually.</p>
<p>Finally (for this post, not for the conference), <strong>Daniya Kamran's
Translating science into poetry</strong> was beautiful and thought-provoking.
She didn't offer examples or concrete tips, but a series
of ideas to consider when writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constant vigilance; remember you are writing to impress the reader and
  earn their continued attention.</li>
<li>Immortality: write as if your writing is immortal; write to transcend
  time.</li>
<li>Dilemma: poetry is about conflict and questions; introduce them into
  your writing.</li>
<li>Bias: have a point of view; be the expert.</li>
<li>Error: poetry is about things that have gone wrong; treat crises
  as part of the cycle, not as a negative consequence.</li>
<li>Reiteration: poetry uses it liberally; after each complexity, bring your
  document back to its purpose.</li>
<li>Metaphors allow the reader to participate in creating meaning, and so
  they connect to your writing more deeply.</li>
<li>Elegance is important.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tim Daly</strong>'s talk on Literate Programming was entertaining; <strong>Jennifer
Hartnett Hender</strong>'s talk about sketchnotes was thought-provoking. <strong>Heidi
Waterhouse</strong> did a talk about writing search-first documentation to make
your documents findable. <strong>Ana Nelson</strong>'s talk about Dexy was thrilling (even
though I was exhausted and understood about 14% of it). There were a couple of
good talks about the importance of documentation, and another couple about how
to convince your company and colleagues to take documentation seriously, and
even to write it themselves.</p>
<p>There were plenty of interesting talks and lots of great people at 
Write the Docs. I don't know if I will go next year, what with not being
a tech writer and all, but I'm glad I went this year and I would recommend
it to anyone who creates documentation and works with developers.</p>
<p>Write the Docs is on <a href="https://twitter.com/writethedocs">Twitter</a>,
where they have posted links to some write-ups of the talks and will hopefully
link to videos when they are up.</p>
