Here are some books I have read lately.
</p>
<p>
<em>Reading Magic: Why Reading Aloud To Our Children Will Change
Their Lives Forever</em> by Mem Fox.  I did not love this book.  Mem
Fox is convincing, nay evangelical, on the subject of reading to your
children, and I am all for that, but I found some of her recommendations
intimidating.  For example, she says you must read books with the same
intonation every time.  Well, sorry, but sometimes I just don't have
the energy to do <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> with full vigour, and
sometimes I do.  Poor Delphine will have to deal with the horrible
ambiguity of it all.  
</p>
<p>
Also Fox wants you to stop and point out rhymes
and play "find the letter" games and stuff, which seems kind of tedious
and teacherly.  Ironically she insists that this stuff isn't teaching;
she calls it "enriching the reading experience".  You're playing!  You're
having a good time!  To me it seems annoying and forced.
</p>
<p>
I would heartily recommend <em>Babies Need Books</em> by Dorothy Butler
over this book.  Butler's book is not only convincingly evangelical
and encouraging about reading to babies and little kids, 
but it also provides pages and
pages of actual book recommendations.  I found it didn't take me long
to be able to pick out a good kid's book after I had read a few of her
suggestions.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
<em>Bloodsucking Fiends: A Love Story</em>, <em>Coyote Blue</em>, and
<em>Practical Demon-Keeping</em> by Christopher Moore.  I don't usually
gorge myself on multiple books by one author like this, but Blake has
been off work and I have been working full-time for the last couple
of weeks, and he has been in charge of going to the library, so this is
what has been new around the house.  The books are good; they are funny
and the characters are engaging.  
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
<em>The Time-Traveler's Wife</em> by Audrey Niffenegger.  This is a
science-fiction romance packaged as a ... I don't know, what do they
call them.  Contemporary fiction?  Those books that come in trade paperback
size and have the kind of fuzzy matte finish and a picture of feet on
the front.  It seems like it should be really confusing, because it 
switches back between one point-of-view and another, and hops back and
forth in time, at every chapter.  But somehow it's easy to follow.  The
story is effectively manipulative, so if you like a good cry you will like
the book, and if you hate to be handled like an emotional marionette you
may find yourself a little annoyed by it.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
I feel like I should have read more, but lately I have been sleeping
instead of reading.  I have a couple of weeks off work with Delphine in
daycare, though, so I am hoping to get some reading in before the baby
comes.

Today is my thirtieth birthday.  So far it has been pleasant; Delphine
let us sleep in until 6:40 (forty minutes extra), and we've been 
pootling around the house ever since.  I did some chores, Blake 
played with Delphine, we all had showers, I had cake and ice cream
and read the newspaper.  Delphine is napping right now, and after she's
up I will open my presents.  She seems more excited about them than
I am.  Presents aren't really as much fun as they used to be when I
was a little kid.  This year will be different than usual, though, because
I got presents from friends as well as family and I have no idea what
they might be.
</p>
<p>
I'm happy to finally be in my thirties.  My life is more that of 
someone in their thirties than someone in their twenties; I have
kids, I have a mortgage, I cook and clean and own furniture made
out of actual wood, I don't drink or go out clubbing, I spend my
money on diapers and organic fruit, not shoes and manicures.  I
am more Heather Mallick than Leah McLaren.  It's good to finally be
in a decade that suits me.  (But I still think I've always been 
forty on the inside, and I think that will be a very good decade for me.)
</p>
<p>
We had a party yesterday; since this is likely our last summer in the
condo I thought we should have a barbeque up on the roof, and my 
birthday was the perfect excuse.  It was a fantastic party; very
low-budget and low-effort, with paper plates and burgers and hot
dogs and a cake from Loblaws and ice cream in cones for the toddlers.
And balloons!  I think it was just perfect.  
</p>
<p>
Jeff, Janet, Kathryn, Douglas and Tanya
and Ursa, Ellen and Peter and Dexter and Maxine, Baba and Zaida,
and Morgan and Erik all came and we just sat and talked and watched
the little ones play.  Morgan and Erik were in charge of the meat
and they did a fine job.  They also lent us their Cadillac of coolers
which happily held dozens of bottles of beer and pop, and then 
ice cream and leftover meat later on.  It's living in our hallway now.
I wonder if they want it back?
</p>
<p>
Almost everyone got to hold Maxine -- she is around six weeks old
now.  Delphine was especially taken with her; when I got my turn to 
hold Maxine, Delphine came and sat next to me and touched her: 
"There's baby's foot.  There's baby's ankle.  There's baby's other
ankle.  There's baby's knee.  Baby's crying."  Yeah, she cried for
me; she didn't cry for anyone else.  Possibly because I was the 
only one who let a toddler fondle her legs.  Anyway, Delphine did
not seem upset or perturbed by Maxine at all this time, just very 
interested.
I am quite looking forward to seeing how she is with our baby.
I expect she will be pretty happy with it until she figures out
that it's staying.
</p>
<p>
Another friend of mine just had a baby (nine days early!  Whoo!).
She lives just a block or two from here so I hope Delphine and I
can go over and visit a time or two before our baby comes.
</p>
<p>
Delphine and I both got sunburned yesterday.  I swore I wouldn't let
her get sunburned under my watch, and already I have failed.  She's,
what, just two years and three months old?  That's pretty lousy.  I even
brought the sunblock upstairs but then I was too stupid to put it
on either me or Delphine.  I think I figured it's late enough in the
summer that we have enough tan to protect us from sunburn.  Except
Delphine hasn't any tan at all because I've been so careful up until
now, and I was wearing a different style of shirt than usual so I 
had fresh virgin skin exposed to the afternoon sun.  Fortunately 
Delphine's burn has already faded to very faint pinkness, and mine 
doesn't look bad enough to blister.  Still, though.  Stupid.
</p>
<p>
Delphine's sleeping, incidentally, has gone from awful to sublime.
The very day after I posted about the problems and my intended plan of
action, she went to bed (about twenty minutes earlier than usual) 
with barely a whimper, and slept longer in the morning.  Last night
was even better; at around 6:30 she announced to Kathryn that she
was tired and wanted to go to bed, so Blake put her down and she did
not cry, not one bit.  Then, like I said above, she slept an extra
forty minutes this morning.  And furthermore, at 11:00 this morning
she told Blake she wanted to lie down for a nap, and she was down and
sleeping by 11:06.  It's not 12:53, so she will probably be up soon.
</p>
<p>
But man, that Weissbluth is a genius.  You only have to <em>read
his book</em> for your kid to sleep better.  I need to buy a copy of
it for myself. Since it covers sleep problems right up to adolescence,
I'm sure I will need it again.
</p>
<p>
The new baby is doing great.  For the last few days he's -- I just
realized I'm using "he" far too often; I think I am getting really 
stuck on the idea of it being a boy because everyone I know who has
had their second baby this summer has had one of the other gender than
their first, and also because all the superstitious types are saying
it's a boy because of how I'm carrying, and also because I would really
kind of like it to be a boy -- so for the last few days <em>she's</em>
been kicking and moving around a lot, which is very cool if occasionally
uncomfortable.  I have another midwife appointment tomorrow, and I hope
they will be more certain about her position.  Two appointments ago
my primary midwife said she was head up, but at the last appointment my
secondary said she was head down.  I don't think it matters at this
point, but we are rapidly approaching the point where it does.

This is a book about how more choices can make you unhappier with
the choice you finally make, and how people are inherently bad
at making decisions.  It was very interesting and gave me some insight
into my own thought processes and their emotional result.  I was 
particularly struck by the discussion about careers; as a middle-class
Westerner I can do pretty much anything I want to (provided I don't 
mind incurring a lot of debt) and that leaves me pretty much paralysed.
What if I pick wrong?  Aaah!
</p>
<p>
I would
recommend this book to just about everyone, particularly people who
feel depressed or dissatisfied with their life.  Not only does it include
a lot of information about how decision-making happens, and how it
can screw you up, the best thing about the book is that the last chapter gives
some concrete suggestions for how to deal with all the choices available
to us.

This is a book about how to bike in the city.  There are a couple of
dogmatic schools of thought about how you're supposed to bike in the
city (the Vehicular school and the Invisible school) and Hurst pretty
much dismantles them both.  He is very pragmatic, about where to
bike, when to bike, how to stay safe, and how to relate to other vehicles.
He has a very calm, accepting philosophy about how things are and
argues that you are better off working within reality rather than spending a
great deal of time being angry at it.  In that sense this is an 
excellent guide to how to live, as well as how to bike.
</p>
<p>
He did piss me off at the end by dissing my bike (I will paraphrase because
I don't have the book with me: "Comfort bikes seem to be designed for
people who want to bike while maintaining as much of a feeling of
sitting on the couch as possible.")  Okay, that's kind of why I bought
my bike, but it still smarts.  
</p>
<p>
Having said that, though, later he talks about how your bike should fit, 
and says that your weight should be equally distributed on your hands, 
your feet and your butt, and it's when beginners don't realize that 
that they are uncomfortable and decide to stop biking.  Well, duh, I bought
my bike with the big seat so that I could sit all my weight on my butt, and 
lo and behold, it's never really comfortable.  
</p>
<p>
So next time
I go out I will try and balance my weight better (I think I will have to
adjust a bunch of stuff, because right now the handlebars are pretty 
high and the seat is pretty low.)  I think, though, that that means biking
is a lot more work than I thought it was.  On the other hand, that means
that if I bike more it will make me much stronger and fitter than I thought
it would.

Robert Sullivan thought it would be cool to spend a year or so hanging
out in an alley watching some rats, and write a book about it and rats
in general.  It turned out to be a pretty good book, but with a lot
of needless philosophising which didn't seem to result in any great
conclusions, that I could tell.  I would have been happy with just lots
of facts and observations.  (The book has them, just mixed in with the
other stuff.)
</p>
<p>
Reading this book I realized that I am missing what seems to be a 
fundamental human trait -- I'm not afraid of rats.  I suppose if you
stuck me in a dark alley surrounded by lots of them, I might be, but
when I imagine the scenario it doesn't faze me at all.   We had rats 
as pets and I have a great deal of appreciation for them; they are
intelligent and resourceful and generally very sensible animals.
And unlike cats, they don't vomit.

<em>Efficient Society: Why Canada Is as Close to Utopia as It
Gets</em> by Joseph Heath.  This is an interesting book about the
benefits of efficiency as a social value, and how Canada is so
great.  I especially like that last part -- who doesn't like to

<em>A Place Of Hiding</em> by Elizabeth George.  This is a good,

woman.  She is contrasted with her analytical husband, and I suppose
you are supposed to relate to the woman, but I really didn't.

I have read a few books since I last posted here.  I didn't post for ages because
for ages I didn't read anything; when Delphine naps, I nap too, because I'm pregnant
and if I don't nap in the afternoon I hit a brick wall at 4:30 and fall asleep over
Delphine's supper.  So in the last couple of months I've clawed myself through two,
maybe three books.
</p>
<p>
Then I threw my back out and got to lie around for two days, and I think I have pretty
much made up any book deficit I might have had.
</p>
<p>
So here's what I've read.  I read a collection of long short stories, or short novels,
or whatever, edited by Robert Silverberg.  <em>Legends</em>, I think.  I'm not sure
which one.  They were pretty good, I guess, but they didn't make me any smarter or
more interesting.
</p>
<p>
<em>Don't Make Me Stop This Car!  Adventures in Fatherhood</em> by Al Roker, which is 
totally a parenting journal/blog, printed out and bound.  Cute.
</p>
<p>
<em>Language Visible: Unravelling the Mystery of the Alphabet from A to Z</em> by
David Sacks, which goes through the history and cultural baggage (for want of a
better word) of the letters of the alphabet, one by one.  Mostly interesting,
although a little repetitious.  Almost all the letters took the same journey from
Egypt to our alphabet; is it really necessary to describe that journey anew for
each letter?  Also I found the historical sidebars pretty boring, but fortunately
the sidebar format made them easy to skip.
</p>
<p>
<em>McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories</em>, edited by Michael
Chabon.  Good stories, although I always feel like short stories are trying too hard.
Like any collection of short stories, this would have been better enjoyed in small
sips rather than gulped down all at once, but I never manage to do that. Besides,
I have to take it back to the library.
</p>
<p>
<em>Beach Girls</em>, by Luanne Rice.  Fluff, but good fluff.  Also a story about
mothers and daughters, which is always guaranteed to get me all verklempt.
</p>
<p>
I think there might have been a couple more, but I don't remember what they are.

I am scraping the bottom of the barrel for clothes that fit these days.  Theoretically
I should have scads of stuff, because I am still smaller in the waist ("waist")
than I was at
the end of the last pregnancy, and I had plenty of clothing then.  I think the fatal
flaw in that theory is that the last pregnancy was in winter, so I have lots of jeans.
It went up to 30 today -- I ain't wearing jeans.
</p>
<p>
I'm down to a couple of skirts and a couple of dresses, which aren't much use for
going to the park with Delphine or sitting on the floor playing with Lego.  So I
made plans, last Thursday,  for Morgan to babysit Delphine for a couple of hours
in the morning while I went to Old Navy or some other appallingly cheap place and got
a couple of pairs of appallingly cheap maternity shorts or capris or something.
</p>
<p>
Instead of doing that, though, I slipped a disk.  It was really quite well planned.
Morgan works at a the same Health Clinic as my chiropractor, and I already had
her lined up to babysit.  She lives right by me so she and Erik were able to come
over to my place to help me get myself and Delphine downtown to the clinic.  
</p>
<p>
But it was bad, it was so bad.  I have never hurt my back this bad before; I actually
cried.  Usually I am stoic, but there was yelping and crying this time.  The chiro
said it was the worst she had seen in fifteen years -- she could hardly touch me.
And it was really stupid and entirely my fault; my back has been so good lately
that I haven't been doing any of the stretching and strengthening exercises I am
supposed to do, and I injured myself by half-bending over with Delphine in my arms,
which is perhaps number one on the long list of things I am <em>not</em> supposed to do
(I have slipped this same disk before).
</p>
<p>
So all my chiro was able to do for me on Thursday was send me home with some 
exercises to encourage the disk back into place, and strict instructions to lie
down all day and ice my back.  I had to call Blake to come home with me and look
after Delphine while I just lay around (which he did without a murmur because he
is a good man -- plus he likes to hang out with Delphine).  
</p>
<p>
Friday Delphine had 
daycare; I woke up feeling better, well enough
to shuffle across the street with Blake to drop her off, and then it was back to
bed.  I was way better by my next chiro appointment that afternoon -- the doctor
was astounded at how much better I was.  She gave me some more treatment (mostly
she doesn't do chiro on me, she does soft-tissue therapy called 
<a href="http://www.activerelease.ca/2_ARTOverview.html">Active Release Techniques</a>
which is pretty phenomenal, although I am a little scared to do any research on it
in case it's actually just quackery.  But it's patented!) and sent me home with
instructions to keep doing what I was doing.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's now Monday, and I am almost all better.  I think that's pretty amazing,
going from totally crippled to almost healed in five days.  If my rapid healing
were an Academy Award, I would thank Blake and Morgan and Erik for dropping everything
to help me get better, and I would thank myself for being smart and asking for help
instead of trying to be heroic.
</p>
<p>
It's only today that I've been able to pick up and hold Delphine.  Four days without
being able to cuddle her was hard, and sad.  It wasn't just the not cuddling, but
knowing I couldn't pick her up if she hurt herself, or run to her if she was in
danger left me feeling like half a mother.  I don't know how parents with chronic
pain or disability do it.  I feel like my own physical ability is intrinsic to my
ability to be a good parent, and I didn't realize I felt that way until my physical
ability was compromised.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, between the pain of my bad back and not being able to have contact with Delphine
the way I'm used to, and not being able to keep up with housework,
and this weird altercation I had with a guy in the lobby
of my building this morning, and some other health problems I will not burden
you with the details of, I am floating in this weird miasma of not-right-ness.
I expect that now that I am mostly better, after a couple of days of normality
(or what passes for it in this time of interminable and tedious flux) I will feel 
okay again.

I'm feeling rather melancholy and insomniacal.  I think the insomnia is
because of the iced coffee and chocolate I had tonight.  I bought some of
that Iced Java coffee syrup stuff and it has a crazy effect on me, maybe
because I've avoided caffeinated coffee for so long.  I think I should not
have any more of it.
</p>
<p>
I'm probably melancholy because I am tired and should be sleeping, but
it's manifesting because the owner of my favourite Internet community
is predicting the imminent demise of her board.  I'm kind of gutted
about it -- I've been part of this community since 2001 and they have
done a lot for me.  Lots of great advice, and a baffling deluge of
actual 3D gifts for Delphine when she was born, and generally good
company through lots of long hours of idleness at work.  I will miss
them so much.
</p>
<p>
I suppose there are other boards with memberships which intersect with
the membership of this board, but I have checked them out and they just
aren't the same.  Obviously, I guess; if they were the same they probably
wouldn't exist.  And I suppose after the board shuts down I will be sad
for a while and then life will go on.  (After all, I walked away from 
akt and #ana and survived, and even hung on to a really good friend
from that community.)  But I will really miss the owner -- I don't know
how much of an Internet presence she is going to maintain after the
board goes down.  Hopefully she will at least keep her journal, which
has always been one of the best on the net.
</p>
<p>
One of the reasons the board is dying is because of non-participation,
and I am certainly part of that problem.  Once Delphine was born and
I stopped working I practically stopped posting at all.  That has made
me realize that the way I spend my time is completely non-congruent with
what I would say my personal priorities are, if you asked me.  Something
like this:
</p>
<p>
<b>Priorities</b>: Blake and Delphine, household, 
reading books, reading newspapers and
magazines, friends and online friends, health, television and pop culture.
</p>
<p>
<b>Time Expenditure</b>: Blake and Delphine, household, 
television, whatever else
I can squeeze in when I'm not watching television.
</p>
<p>
It's ridiculous; I haven't read more than a couple of books for months,
and yet we sit and watch TV for two or three hours every night.  There's
maybe four or five hours of stuff per week that I am really interested 
in watching, but we end up watching filler like "Holmes on Homes" or 
"Top 10 Technological Disasters of the 20th Century" just because we
have to have the TV on and that's all there is.  It's a sickness and it's
really starting to piss me off.  There are so many books out there I
could be reading.  I could be ten times smarter than I am.
</p>
<p>
Not to mention all the other stuff I should be doing but "don't have
time" for.  I have about five paper letters waiting to be responded to,
from valuable and interesting friends who happen to live far away from me.
I have a lovely brother who is constantly waiting on email from me with news
about his niece.
I have a stack of decorating magazines to go through to tear out ideas for my
decorating file.  I have political representatives who really should be
informed of my opinions on such pressing matters as AIDS in Africa and
the impending flu epidemic.  And back to the original topic at hand, I
can't very well cry and moan about my favourite online community dying 
when I haven't posted more than a dozen times in the last month.  Are
they supposed to keep it alive for my benefit, so all my buddies will 
still be there when I decide to show my face again?
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's well past midnight and I am so going to regret staying up
late tomorrow, but I couldn't sleep and posting this is better than tossing and
turning and bothering Blake.  Hopefully now I have got it off my chest
I will be able to relax and sleep better.
