<strong><em>Your Three-Year-Old: Friend or Enemy</em> by 
Louise Bates Ames and Frances Ilg</strong> is useful, like
the two-year-old version.  They're pretty old (this one
is from the mid-eighties) so they're weirdly time-capsulish.
This one gives a suggested plan for your kid's third birthday,
and it's all "you should be able to manage this with the
help of two or three other mothers".  Presumably Father is
in the drawing room smoking his pipe?
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Your Call Is Important To Us: The Truth about
Bullshit</em> by Laura Penny</strong>.  It must be very hard
to write about bullshit, because 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/books/_2005/december24.html">Don
Watson</a> tried to do it, and failed, and now there's this.  It
started off pretty well, but eventually turned into an 
all-purpose lefty jeremiad, with the usual anti-corporate,
anti-globalization, anti-consumer (Evian is naive spelled
backwards!) stuff.  
Not so much with the bullshit.  She also handily ignores
the great steaming heaps of the stuff generated by leftish
groups like anti-GM protesters; as if conservatives have
a monopoly on bullshit!
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Me and Mr. Stenner</em> by Evan Hunter</strong>.  I
was glad to find out that Evan Hunter is the pseudonym of 
Ed McBain (actually, vice versa, but I'm  not sure what the
latin for "real name" is) and that he's written a million books.
This one is a book for young adults, and I really enjoyed it.
Hunter is a genius at capturing dialogue, and this is no different,
except it is set (and written) in 1976 so the dialogue is
kind of quaint.  I wish he had written more young adult books --
this is as good as Judy Blume.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Perfect Parents: Baby-care Advice Past and Present</em> 
by Christina Hardyment</strong> is a book which chronicles the changes in
advice given to parents from the 1700s until now.  This is a lovely
book because it makes you realize that despite all the crazy-ass
things people have done with their children, society still seems
to chug along.  It was a surprise to me how much variation there
has been in childcare practices; I had a vague idea that in the
Olden Days everyone was really strict, and now everyone is really
permissive, and that's all there is to it, but really there has
been a lot more subtlety in parenting practices over the centuries.
Hardyment is a historian, so there is a lot of discussion about
how historical events like wars inform parenting.
</p>
<p>
I would recommend this book to anyone who is annoyed or bewildered
by the variety of advice out there.  I only wish it were newer,
so I could hear what Hardyment has to say about the judgemental
insanity that is Dr. Sears and attachment parenting.  (Which is, 
like the curate's egg, good in parts.)
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Blackboard Jungle</em> by Evan Hunter</strong>.  Evan Hunter --
Ed McBain -- wrote <em>The Blackboard Jungle</em>!  Cool!  So I had
to take it out of the library and have a read.  It's really good.
Can I just stop saying that Hunter/McBain books are really good?
That would save some typing.  It's about a novice teacher dealing
with the, well, crap of working at an inner-city vocational school.
There is an especially good rant in the middle about vocational
schools and teaching and what does it all mean?
</p>
<p>
Obviously, I think this would be a really interesting book for
Kathryn to read since she is also a novice teacher dealing with
lots of crap, but I am reluctant to because if she didn't like it
I would be very sad.  So Kathryn, I recommend this book but if
you don't like it please don't say anything!

You know how all makeup claims it's the best thing since they
invented makeup, and it will change your life?  Well, Cover Girl 
LashExact won't change your life, but it does do what it claims, which
is not clump.  As far as I can tell the goo in the bottle is
the same as ever, but the wand is new technology; it's not
regular bristles like a normal mascara brush, but little plastic
bristles very evenly spaced.  It works a dream.
</p>
<p>
The next thing I like is something my mother sent us, a set of
three CDs called <a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=6717773&amp;style=music&amp;cart=312913608&amp;BAB=E">100 Silly Songs</a>. 
It has every kid's song you have ever heard, plus a few
that haven't been heard for decades because they're quite
politically incorrect, like "The King of the Cannibal
Islands", or "I Wish I Were A Little Bar of Soap".  They're 
all nicely arranged and well-sung, with
complete verses.  It's almost like a reference CD.
</p>
<p>
The last thing I have bought that I like is my new
<a href="http://www.myfullerbrush.com/tidy.htm">crumb sweeper</a>.
I didn't get that brand -- mine is much cuter -- but the idea
is the same.  It works really well at picking up the crumbs
off the tablecloth after Delphine the barbarian has
eaten -- I just, swoosh, sweep it across the table and the
crumbs are gone as if by magic.  
(I use a tablecloth because our table is wood and I
want to keep it nice until the children have manners and are
less prone to drumming on the table with their forks and
such.)  I am looking forward to the post-croissant cleanup on
Sunday.

First I need to add a couple of things about the high chair.
You probably already have a thousand thin flannel receiving
blankets -- if you don't now is a good time to go get some,
or better, find a friend (or an aunt with a friend) who has
a serger, and get them to make you a bunch of two foot by
two foot squares of flannel.
</p>
<p>
Once you have your pile of blankets, fold one up so that it
lines the high chair under the baby.  Then when the
inevitable explosive poo happens you will only have to 
wash the blanket, not the entire high chair cover.  Repeat
as necessary for bouncy chair, car seat, stroller, etc.
</p>
<p>
You'll also need a rolled up hand towel to prop next to
the baby in the high chair, so she doesn't topple over
sideways.  
<a href="http://delphine.latte.ca/pics/2003/0702/03-w-inChair.jpg">Like
this.</a>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Diapers</h4>
<p>
I haven't come across a brand of diapers which isn't perfectly 
adequate.  They all seem to do the trick, store-brand or name-brand
alike.  Huggies are a little nicer in that they are softer and
stretchier, but they don't objectively function any better.  Pampers
are just weird because they are scented:  why?  If you get
on Huggies' mailing list they will send you big fat coupons on
a regular basis, so you can feel a bit better about spending
huge piles of money on diapers, but I'm not sure how I got on
the list.  Maybe just email them and ask?
</p>
<p>
Wipes, on the other hand, are not all created equal.  The cheap
brands all seem to be smooth and thin and useless at sponging up
poop.  We stick with Huggies-brand wipes when we're out, and wet washcloths
when we're home, which you probably won't want to do unless you
launder your own cloth diapers.  Huggies are more expensive, but
since you probably use twice as many of the cheap kind maybe
it works out in the end.  There might be other good brands out
there, but I'm warning you, buy a small package to start off
with because you don't want to be stuck with 200 lousy wipes.
</p>
<p>
I don't think you're using cloth diapers because you're not
INSANE, but if you do and you wash them yourself, let me tell
you the big secret:  use Tide.  There is all sorts of advice
out there to have two diaper pails, or to soak overnight, or
to rinse with vinegar, blah dee blah dee blah.  I just stick
the diapers in a pail all by their smelly selves, and then
dump them in the washer on a heavy-duty hot cycle with Tide.
Voila, fresh, stain-free diapers.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, in other laundry news, most stains ever encountered
by man or baby can be removed with an overnight soak in a wash basin with
hot water and some Oxy-Clean.  I just used it to get some thirty-year-old
stains out of a hand-me-down blanket from when Blake was a baby.
It's freaky-good.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Sleeping</h4>
<p>
If you're nursing, the best advice I can give you is to sleep
with your baby.  I've slept with both of mine and I had to nod
politely through all those conversations with other mothers about
being so sleep-deprived, because I'm just not.  Baby wakes up, you
offer the boob, baby nurses while you drift back to sleep.
And sleeping with your baby is just nice.  It's lovely to be
able to smell her soft round head in the middle of the night.
</p>
<p>
I don't know if I would try it if I were bottle-feeding, though,
because breast-feeding mothers actually sleep more lightly than
normal people, so you're less likely to squish your baby in the
night.  Also don't sleep with your baby if you smoke (!), or if
you've been drinking or taken medication which makes you sleepy
like Neo-Citran.  Also the baby should sleep next to you, not
between you and your husband, again because of the rolling-onto
issue.  We have a bed rail on my side of the bed but it's just a
technicality, because your baby will glom onto you like a remora.
It's astonishing how quickly a supposedly non-mobile baby will make
her way across a bed to the nearest warm body.
</p>
<p>
(Having said that, I still think the bed rail is a good idea.
And don't put the baby on the bed between you and a wall, there's just
too much scope for disaster there.)
</p>
<p>
You'll also want another one of those receiving blankets under
your baby and your boobs, to catch poop and spit-up and spilled
milk.  It's a lot easier to change a small blanket than your
entire bottom sheet.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Crying</h4>
<p>
Blake's advice for dealing with a crying baby is, do everything
you can think of.  Then do it again.  Eventually something will
work.  My advice is, do all the sensible things (feed, change, 
burp, rock, etc) and if nothing works, take off all her clothes.
Ostensibly you're looking for rashes or irritating tags on her
clothes or whatever, but I find babies just like being naked.
</p>
<p>
Remember crying peaks at six weeks, so this won't actually go on
forever.  And if you have done everything you can think of and
she's still crying (and you don't think she's sick), remember to
keep cuddling her.  Even if you can't make her stop crying at least
you can give her comfort.  (Unless you think you might throw
her out the window; in that case, put the baby down (somewhere
safe) and back away (maybe into the shower or something) -- give
yourself a time-out.)
</p>
<p>
Another thing you might do, although I don't remember doing this
with Delphine, is go out for a walk.  Fresh air usually settles
babies down and if she's tired the stroller will help her sleep.
Our midwife told us about a 24-hour drugstore where there are
often groggy parents doing midnight laps with their babies in
strollers.
</p>
<p>
One thing that helped me when I felt like a lousy parent because
I couldn't stop Delphine from crying was to think about people with
sick babies.  Blake was really sickly when he was a kid and he must
have spent HOURS of his life crying, and it doesn't seem to have
done him any harm.  I have a friend whose baby had open-heart
surgery at six months -- he must have cried so much, and there was
nothing his parents could do, but he is a perfectly normal and
happy kid now.  So don't put too much stock in the crying -- it's
upsetting to you, the parent, because it's meant to be, but it
doesn't always mean something is horribly wrong that you can
fix.

<strong>
<em>Who Runs This Country, Anyway? A Guide to Canadian Government</em>
    by Joanne Stanbridge</strong> is a kids' book but since I knew
    nothing about the structure of our government I needed something
    with small words and lots of diagrams.  This served the purpose
    and now I know more stuff.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Fiddlers</em> by Ed McBain.</strong>  Ed McBain is dead.  This makes me
sad.  Ed McBain wrote lots and lots of books, and I have only begun
to scratch the surface of them.  This makes me feel a little better.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>In Her Shoes</em> by Jennifer Weiner
</strong> is pretty good fluff.  Yeah, they made that movie about it.
I'm sure the book is better -- it's pretty thick and I'm sure they
had to cut a lot of it out to make a movie.  I won't be renting the
movie to find out though.  (It wasn't THAT good.)  The characterization
is a little suspect, though; people change but the author isn't
really convincing as to why they change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Collapse: How Societies Choose to Succeed or Fail</em> 
    by Jared Diamond
    </strong> took me forever to read, not because it's badly
    written but because it's long and Diamond is teeth-achingly
    thorough.  He examines at least eight societies in minute detail
    in order to make himself clear.  It's more like taking a course
    than reading a book.  By the end you're well and truly convinced,
    though.
    </p>
<p>
    It was an interesting read in light of the other book I read about
    how it's all going to hell, <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/books/_2005/november11.html"><em>The Long Emergency</em></a>; Diamond isn't as
    pessimistic but it's clear that he's thinking something big is
    going to happen within our lifetimes or those of our children
    (although probably not his since I think he's in his seventies.
    The man is awesome!  So smart and sprightly and he has that dapper
    Abe Lincoln beard-but-no-moustache thing going on.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Ingrid and the Wolf</em> by André Alexis
</strong> is a book for young adults which I would have loved when
I was younger.  I still quite like it now.  It was too short, though --
I would have wished it had gone on for much longer.  As an adult I
see that it is a good length for the story, though.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Who's Afraid of a Large Black Man</em> by Charles Barkley
</strong>.  Not much to say -- this didn't suck.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Your Two-Year-Old: Terrible or Tender</em> by Louise Bates Ames
</strong>.  You know how everyone says "my kid didn't come with a user's
manual!"  Well, here it is.  This is just a discussion of what kids
are like, and it's one of a series covering different ages.  There
isn't much specific advice, but what there is is delightfully non-judgemental
and pragmatic.  I'm reading the one about three-year-olds, and their
recommendation for dealing with three-and-a-half-year-olds?  Put
them in daycare, because they're at an age where they want to evoke
an emotional reaction in their mother, so they act up.  With a daycare
provider, no emotional reaction, no acting up, everyone is much 
happier.  Failing that, they say, get a babysitter.  Awesome!
</p>
<p>
They also give some advice which set my mind at ease: they give you
a bunch of "techniques" (ie, tricks) for dealing with your toddler
and getting things done, like saying "Let's put away your toys" instead
of telling the kid to do it and then getting into a huge battle of wills
ending with the inevitable timeout.  If you say "Let's..." then you can
just go ahead and do it without your kid's help, and no-one has lost face.
I had been thinking that I can't do stuff like that because I Have To
Show Her Who Is Boss -- Ames says it's more important just to get through
the day without a thousand battles than to make every interaction about
who is boss.  So, very useful books.

I have this friend who just had a baby, and I am about busting
with advice that she does not want.  But!  There is so much I
have learned about babies!  I want to share!
</p>
<p>
So I will non-agressively put what I have learned here so she
can take my advice or not without giving offence, and also so it's available for
anyone else who wants it.
</p>
<p>
Of course I don't suggest that all of this advice will work
for everyone, but some of it will work for someone, and I
think the more we all talk about how we handle this parenting 
thing the better off we will be.  (To that end you should go
read <a href="http://smartypants.diaryland.com/">Mimi
Smartypants</a> and <a href="http://www.dooce.com/">Dooce</a>.)

Your baby is going sleep most of the time, but after she's a
couple of weeks old she'll be awake sometimes too.  Most of the time
you'll be feeding her and changing her diaper, but sometimes 
you're going to want to put her down.  Get a <strong>high
chair</strong>.  One that reclines a lot so you can put a 
newborn in it.  We have an Evenflo Simplicity Easy-fold which 
I am very happy with.  Cordelia sits in it and hangs out while
I'm cooking or typing or whatever.  Also it has wheels on it
so I can wheel her around the condo with me.  (You're not
supposed to wheel it around with the baby in it, but whatever.)
And I tip it all the way back and put a blanket on her and
a soother in her mouth, and bang, she's asleep.  (I think
the way the chair surrounds her is more comforting than lying
flat on her back in the crib -- she's only four months out of the
womb, after all.)  It's her one-stop captain's chair.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly I haven't heard this advice anywhere else -- where
do other people put their babies when they're awake?  Alone in
their crib?  In a bouncy chair so all they can see is knees?
Flat on their back in a playpen to look at the ceiling?  I don't
know.
</p>
<p>
Okay, that's all for now because Cordelia is howling (in her
high chair -- it doesn't work miracles!).

No particular reason for that title, I just always wanted to use
it, and it is generally true.  In fact, I could pretty much use
it as the title of my entire journal.
</p>
<p>
First some shout outs (shouts out?) to my crippled friends.
On the other side of the pond is my friend Frances, who I
knew when I was in the equivalent of grade seven and eight,
and who I have by some miracle managed to keep in touch with
ever since, off and on.  We barely know each other, really,
but we persist in keeping in touch because we're stubborn
like that.  And as it turns out she likes Minette Walters
too, so she must be at least as cool as she was back in 
1907 or whenever.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, she is laid up with a broken leg which she suffered
in a bar fight at the hands of two unnamed female assailants while nobly
protecting a friend.  Fortunately Frances is a kickboxer
so if she has a broken leg I shudder to think what shape
the others were in.  
</p>
<p>
A little closer to home, my friend Kathryn (Delphine's
"beatifuw Kafryn") also broke her ankle over Christmas.
Sadly she doesn't have a good story like Frances, but she
does have an assortment of plates and pins in her leg which
necessitate her carrying a card at all times stating that
she is not a terrorist.  I think that's pretty cool.  
</p>
<p>
Kathryn is one of those people who seems to be blessed with
longer days than the rest of us, because she crams in so
much.  Besides being a teacher she also is in at least two
bands (she plays flute and piccolo) and my choir.  She plays
volleyball and just the other day I suggested we go skating
together sometime (after she's better, of course) and she
casually mentioned that yeah, she's a certified CanSkate
instructor.  All this and she's pretty too.  She
has a <a href="http://inquisiturient.blogspot.com/">new
blog</a> so all y'all can read about her interesting 
and busy life.  (No pressure, Kathryn.)
</p>
<p>
Cordelia just woke up so that will have to be all for now.
I'm off for a cuppa tea.

Due to an ill-advised combination of drinks last night (cherry
beer plus sweet wine plus cider) I woke up with a killer
headache and no small amount of nausea.  It was miserable;
you would think by thirty I would know how to drink sensibly.
I didn't even get drunk!  It was just all the alcopop.
</p>
<p>
But the best part is that my back, which has been troubling
me for weeks, feels fantastic today;  no aching or tightness
or alarming stabbing pains. I'm not sure if it's coincidence
or the muscle relaxant properties of alcohol, or what, but 
I am very pleased.  (Now that my headache and nausea is gone.)

The sub-title says it all.  This is a book of value both to those
both looking for advice on child-rearing and looking for guidance
on how to live according to Jewish teachings.
</p>
<p>
The thing that strikes me, as a secular Christian, about Judaism
is that it provides so much guidance on how to live daily life.
Judaism takes the sacred out of the temple or the church and puts
it in the home, it takes the worshipping out of the hands of the
priests and shamans and puts it in the hands of the mothers and
fathers.  (I guess that's what comes of centuries of persecution --
you spread your faith around so it always survives.  Kind
of the distributed computing of religions.) 
</p>
<p>
Conveniently for the rest of us, Jewish teachings with respect
to the home and the raising of children are eminently sensible
and time-tested.  This book has advice about how to appreciate
your children, how to get them to appreciate (that is, respect)
you, how to teach them gratitude, get them to do chores, 
discipline them.  The author is a psychiatrist and a mother, too,
so she puts the teachings in a modern perspective.  She's also
pretty funny.
</p>
<p>
This is a useful book and an easy read, and has lots of good
recommendations for other books -- in fact, I might get this
out of the library again just for the bibliography (some of the
books she references aren't applicable to my children just yet).
You will also learn lots of useful Hebrew words like <em>yetzer
hara</em>.  (Maybe that's Yiddish?  She doesn't say.)

<strong><em>Never Let Me Go</em> by Kazuo Ishiguro</strong> is a science fiction
book by a non-science fiction author.  As such it's kind of implausible from an
sf point of view because Ishiguro isn't trying to create a rigorous, believeable
universe to satisfy nerds like me, he's creating an allegory to make a point.  So
I guess it's not really science fiction; I'm not sure what you would call it.
Anyway, it's very good and quite sad. And I guess it's not all that unbelieveable.
It depends how pessimistic you are feeling.

<p>
<strong><em>Race Against Time</em> by Stephen Lewis</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is a collection of essays originally delivered as the 2005 Massey Lectures.
Stephen Lewis is the United Nations' Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa and boy,
is he pissed.  Basically we are all screwing over Africa because we can't be bothered
to spend the few bucks it would take to treat and prevent AIDS and thereby rescue
an entire continent from tragic poverty and remove from the world yet another
hatching ground for un-parented proto-terrorists.  (He doesn't say that thing
about terrorists, that's mine.)  
</p>
<p>
Africa is full of child-led and grandmother-led
families and it's heartbreaking and sickening how we continue to turn our backs
on it.  Africa is a magical land rich with resources and cultures and the rest of
the world has metaphorically hit it over the head, stolen its lunch money, kicked
it in the ribs and is now walking away.  Call your representatives and tell them
it is time to look after Africa.
</p>
<p>
Also Stephen Lewis is smart and strong and noble and brave, even if I did make fun
of his daughter-in-law here a while back.

<strong><em>American Backlash: The Untold Story of Social Change in The United States</em> by
Michael Adams</strong>
</p>
<p>
Michael Adams is the head of a polling company which has done extensive 
polling of Americans and discovered that the true divide in American
values isn't between Republicans and Democrats but between politically
engaged citizens and those who couldn't give a rat's ass.  And it's the
values of the non-rat's-ass-givers which are leading the trajectory of
social change in American from respect and independence to hedomism and
individualism.  So he says.   He also talks about how the two parties can
reach undecided voters, and why the Democrats are having their asses
whupped so bad lately.
</p>
<p>
He makes some pretty compelling arguments, but
now I am more interested to read <em>Fire and Ice</em>, which compares
Canadian values to American values.
</p>
<p>
I think Jon Stewart should read this book, except he probably already has.
Although maybe not, because I'm not sure this book has been published
in the US.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>How to Simply Cut Children's Hair: A Step-by-Step Guide to Cutting, Perming
and Highlighting Children's Hair</em> by Laurie Punches</strong>
</p>
<p>
This book seemed pretty useful and I might get it out again once Delphine is old
enough to sit still while I try and cut her hair.  And before she gets old enough
that she is too cool to have a home haircut.  So that will be a, what, two week
window?  The book blurb says "Exploration is part of the adventure" -- let me assure you
that an eleven-year-old does not want you having any adventures with her hair.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally I should look up books on how to cut my own hair -- I am meeting
more and more people who cut their own hair and I think I should try it.  Fifty
bucks every six weeks is just too much money.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Leading a Software Development Team: A Developer's Guide to Successfully
Leading People &amp; Projects</em> by Richard Whitehead</strong>
</p>
<p>
Like it says in the title, this book is written for developers so it sometimes
left me wondering whether I can make it as a software manager.  Whitehead talks a
lot about design and architecture, saying that it's important to take the time
to come up with a good design before you begin coding. I understand that that is 
important but
I am not sure that I would be able to tell if my team had come up with a good
design.  Actually, no,
I think I would be able to tell if we had a lousy design, but I'm not sure
I would be able to convince my team that I'm right.  Perhaps the only problem is
one of confidence.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, because the book is written for developers it leaves one with the impression
that the only good team lead or project manager is someone who started off coding;
I don't think that's true but I need to read "A Non-Developer's Guide to Successfully
Leading Software People and Projects" or some such book to get an idea of my 
career trajectory.  I need to decide how much time to dedicate to being in
development before I can move into project management -- none?  Five years?
Ten?  Or maybe I will go through testing instead.
</p>
<p>
Did I really just say that?
Am I insane?  How passionately did I swear that I would never ever do testing again?
Can I really go back into a job I hated and love it and make a career out of it?
Has my attitude improved that much?  I just don't know.
</p>
<p>
Still, this is a very good and useful book that covers many areas of project
management, from technical issues to decision making to managing team members
to dealing with lousy bosses.  Blake is going to read it too.  The only worrying
thing is that the author photograph very flatteringly makes the author look
about 32 so I'm not sure I trust him.

I have too much stuff in too little space, and I don't have
the resources to reduce the stuff or increase the space.
My hair looks like hell and is constantly, annoyingly in my eyes.
I have a premobile baby whose every physical need is my
responsibility, and a stubborn toddler whose emotional
upheavals are severely trying my already limited patience and
empathy.  I have so many things to do and I haven't any idea
how or when to start.
</p>
<p>
My skin is so dry that every time I move my bra feels like
sandpaper on my raw back, and my hands make me cry to look
at them.  My feet are revoltingly calloused and I haven't
painted my nails since before Christmas.  All my clothes 
are old and ill-fitting, and I couldn't make myself look
respectable even if I had the time and space to do so.
</p>
<p>
But instead of dealing with any of these problems, or just
waiting for them to pass, I bake.  Please, come over and
eat my cookies and carrot cake and banana bread.  And while
you're here you can help me get rid of some crap.  Or maybe
just hold the baby while I fix my toenails.
