<p>This Monday I turned 41 years old. It came as a bit of a surprise. All my life I've felt a particular age, usually not my actual age,  and it's always been younger, as if I got 
stuck. For example, I felt 34 for at least three years after I stopped being 34, and I think the one before that was 27. 
This is the first time I've gotten ahead of myself: I feel like I'm about 44, and I keep being surprised that I'm only 41. </p>
<p>It has been a rocky year. My last birthday was marked by picking up my family from the airport in Saskatoon, and picking up my mother's ashes from the crematorium on the way out of town. Then we stopped for burgers at A&amp;W. </p>
<p>This birthday was marked by sharing a traditional memorial feast for (and with) our ancestors with good friends who also lost a grandparent on July 31. We had burgers.</p>

<p>I'm going to go out on a sturdy limb and say 2015 wasn't one of my best years. It wasn't an unqualified disaster, though. Let's start at the beginning.</p>
<p>The year started off phone-free, because I dropped my phone down a drain in December 2013. I stubbornly tried to manage without buying a new iPhone, but I finally gave up and blew the $600 or whatever on an unlocked replacement. I'm much more careful with my phone outside, now, so I guess I grew as a person.</p>

<p>Dear Mum,</p>
<p>Today would have been your birthday. It’s been three and a half months since you died, and I thought you might like an update.</p>
<p>I know that of all the places you’re likely to be (and I expect you’re probably not actually anywhere, although Shirley thinks you’re in the blue jays) the Internet is the least likely, so I’m not sure why I’m posting this online. Maybe, like everything else post-mortem, it’s for me, not for you --- on account of you’re dead.</p>
<p>I hope being dead is working out for you. Wouldn’t it be nice if there were really a heaven, and you could be with your dad and your sister again? Maybe even your handsome first husband, who you loved so much. (I didn’t find any pictures of him in your stuff --- but there were pictures of Dad’s first wife. You were way prettier.)</p>

<p>I can’t say 2014 was one of my best years ever. I tried to travel, and failed; the house ate all our money; my mom got sick. On the other hand, my mom got better (and we discovered how much fun it is when I visit her without the kids), and we got kittens.</p>

<p>We don’t get a fog a lot in Toronto, and on a foggy night about a month ago the Christmas lights were particularly lovely -- dreamy and soft. I was on the way home from a meeting and thought the lights on house on a corner were so pretty, I wanted to take a picture to show the girls. I paused at the curb opposite the house, and took my phone out of my pocket. I still had my mittens on, but I needed my fingers to use the phone, so I wedged the phone in my left hand, wedged between my fingers and the fleshy base of my thumb. I used my fingertips and thumb to remove the mitten from my right hand, and as I did so the phone slipped, or my grip relaxed. For the longest second ever recorded, my phone fell toward the storm drain I had just realized I was standing above. </p>

<p>I know. It’s a bit late. I meant to post this earlier, but then life… </p>
<p>(And I realized that the reason you post your New Year’s Resolutions as soon as
you can is that it’s embarrassing to post them after you’ve already broken
them.)</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<h5>1. Increase my machine time at the gym from 20 minutes to 30 minutes.</h5>
<p>My gym routine is almost literally the least I can do: twenty minutes on a
machine, usually the elliptical, and then fifteen minutes or more of
stretching. I’m really there for the stretching, because if I don’t do it
regularly sooner or later my back goes into spasm.</p>
<p>But I figured another ten minutes can’t be too hard to come by, and a
bit more cardio three or four times a week can’t be a bad idea.</p>
<h5>2. Double-veg</h5>
<p>Another simple one: whenever I have fruit or vegetables, have twice as much.
I like fruit and vegetables, and it’s really only habit which stops me from
eating more of them.</p>
<h5>3. Write more.</h5>
<p>This is your classic poorly-planned, doomed-to-fail resolution. There is no
plan here, no list of steps, no schedule, just a vague intention to “write
more”. </p>
<p>Nothing specific, not a novel or poems or a book on the history of quick
breads, but more little things: more book reviews on Goodreads, more blog
posts, more letters to family, more entries in my journal.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this one needs more work. I don’t want to give it up,
though.</p>

<p>I'm writing this a little late, as it's already 2014. I suppose this
way I can be sure I'm not missing anything, as one never knows if 11:42 pm on
December 31 might be the highlight of the year.</p>
<p>Well, it wasn't. But at about that time someone did ask me what the highlight
of 2013 was, and I was stumped. I thought of our trip to Buffalo, but that was
in December; not even a month prior. So to write this post I'm going to have to
look at calendars, to-do lists, photos, old emails... Clearly my own brain
won't suffice.</p>
<p>In January I wrapped up work on <em>Shamans
Among Us</em> with <a href="http://josephpolimeni.com/">Joseph Polimeni</a>. I edited and typeset the book, as well as
designing the cover and overseeing proofreading and website design.  It was
a fascinating book to work on; I learned a tremendous amount.</p>
<p>But after <em>Shamans</em> wrapped I set aside my editing work to join
Greg Wilson at <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org">Software
Carpentry</a>. That's a big deal, really. It's my first regular, non-freelance
job since Delphine was born. 
It's so nice to be part of a team, to be useful and wanted for
something other than knowing where the clean socks are and what we're having
for dinner.</p>
<p>We all did a lot of travelling this year, mostly by ourselves.
Delphine went to a few Guide camps and week-long sleepover camp in summer, and
Cordelia went to Brownie camp.  Blake went to Pittsburgh, London, Brussels, San
Francisco and Minneapolis, and I went to Portland OR, Boston, and London (but
not at the same time as Blake). The girls and I went to Saskatchewan in June,
and in December we all went to Buffalo, which <em>sounds</em> lame but might have been
the best trip of all. </p>
<p>In June my first-cousin-once-removed Emily came to visit with her boyfriend
Dan. I never met her before (I don't think? I feel like I should know this) so
that was pretty cool, because she's awesome and Dan is too.  The girls loved
them because Emily is from New Zealand and that's pretty much Middle Earth, and
because Dan played Lord of the Rings Risk with them. (Emily was also written up
in the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/22/emily-does-chicago-new-ze_n_3314832.html">Huffington
Post</a>, which is more than pretty much anyone else I know can say.)</p>
<p>This is a pretty uneventful year in review, so I guess 2013 was a pretty
uneventful year. I'm okay with that! I hope 2014 is also uneventful, and with
some interesting trips. And maybe more cats.</p>

<p>On Saturday, December 21 the girls and Blake and I went to a Christmas
carolling party at a friend’s house. We sang lots of old-fashioned Christmas
carols (the ones they don’t sing at school because there’s too much Christmas
in them) and drank wine and talked about the coming storm. “Charge your
phones,” I said, “make sure you have milk and bread!”</p>
<p>“Is it going to be all that bad?” My friends moved here from England just over
a year ago — they weren’t here for the ice storm in Ottawa and Quebec
back in 1998.  </p>
<p>“It could be nothing, or it could be a few days without power,”
I said.</p>
<p>By the time we left it was raining, cold hard rain which was starting to
freeze on the ground. Blake walked us home and went out again to meet some
friends at a pub. I plugged my phone in, made sure my computer was
charged, tucked the girls in and headed to bed with <em>The Sea-Captain’s
Wife</em>.</p>
<h5>Sunday, December 22</h5>
<p>When we woke up the power was out but the house was still warm.  I lit some
candles and boiled a saucepan of water for tea. I shuffled to the gym and
back, and the power came back on around 10:30. Easy!</p>
<!-- PICTURE: icy decorations -->

<p>The city was covered in ice, part of the subway was shut down and people were being advised not
to go out if they didn’t need to, but Delphine and I had tickets for the
Sing-Along Messiah. When we heard at around 11:00 that Massey Hall was open and
the Sing-Along Messiah was on, we still weren't sure whether to go or not.</p>
<p>My friends who were going to come with us decided not to go --- they told a
very long story about a branch in their driveway and ice on their car and the
subway might not be running and it would be hard and they’d rather just not
bother. That was disappointing and we thought about staying home too, but we
decided that an adventure of any kind would be preferable to staying cooped up
at home being sullen.</p>
<p>Waiting for the bus, a lady shuffled towards us with unkemped hair and flushed
skin, sprinkling rock salt from a gallon jug on the sidewalk ahead of her. “The
subway isn’t running from Eglinton to Bloor,” she said. “No trains! They’re
running shuttle buses!” Again we thought about giving up, but decided to forge
ahead.</p>
<p>At Yonge Street three shuttle buses drove past, each too crammed to pick anyone
up.  A small CBC TV crew was shooting some B-roll of people giving up; Delphine
wanted to be interviewed for TV but they found someone less hopeful.</p>
<p>Finally I decided to work around the Yonge Street problem altogether by
catching the number 14 bus over to the University-Spadina line. The number 14
was diverting from its usual route because of branches on the roads, too, but
it was only a twenty minute ride to Glencairn</p>
<!-- PICTURE: hobbit train -->

<p>The subway train we caught at Glencairn was the Hobbit train, which pretty much
made the whole trip worthwhile.  We got to Dundas station ten minutes before
show time and didn’t miss a single note. Dame Emma Kirkby sang. (I wonder how
she enjoyed it.) There might have been a bit of a trainwreck in the Amen fugue,
but we pulled it together with lots of help from Ivars. Delphine had a good
time and she’s starting to learn the choruses and sing along. All in all,
going was absolutely the right choice.</p>
<p>After the sing-along we wandered the mall with Janet, who had joined us for
Messiah, and then met Blake and Cordelia for dinner.  We ate at Mr Greenjeans,
our favourite mall restaurant. After a lot of food we went home and
noticed that it was very dark on our block; the power had just gone off again.</p>
<h5>Monday, December 23</h5>
<p>The lights were still out Monday morning. I was supposed to go grocery shopping
for Christmas dinner ingredients, but the grocery store was closed. I’m
actually not sure what we did all day; cooking and washing dishes, tending to
candles. I wrapped Blake’s Christmas gifts in the basement by the light of a
single candle. I spent a lot of time checking the @TorontoHydro Twitter
account. The girls and Blake decorated their gingerbread houses, which they had
cleverly baked the day before the power went out. </p>
<p>At 8:45 pm on Monday, after the power had been out for over 24 hours, it was
16.3° Celsius in the house. People kept inviting us over to their house
to warm up, and I didn’t realize why until later when I heard that 
other houses cooled down to 10 degrees and lower within a day. I
don’t think there’s any one thing which made our house stay so warm; it’s a
combination of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>really small house (about 1200 square foot)</li>
<li>a layer of rigid foam insulation on the inside of every outside wall
  (making the house even smaller)</li>
<li>semi-detached, so one wall of the house
  is insulated by <em>an entire other house</em>
</li>
<li>protected on the north side by another house which is about three feet away</li>
<li>newish, small windows</li>
<li>honeycomb blinds </li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, we have a gas water heater and a gas stove, so we were able to
warm the place up with hot showers and cooking. I'm feeling pretty good about
our little house these days.</p>
<h5>Tuesday, December 24</h5>
<p>On Christmas Eve morning it was 13.4°C when we woke up; it went up to
15.3°C by the end of breakfast. We went out for lunch and to see <em>The
Hobbit</em>; when we got home the temperature had gone down to 11.4°C. We lit
some candles and made pasta for dinner, and managed to drag the temperature up
to 13°C before bed.  Blake and I had to stay up later than the girls
because of Christmas, but I lit lots of
candles and we managed.</p>
<!-- PICTURE: candles on mantelpiece -->

<h4>Christmas Day</h4>
<p>When we woke up on Christmas Day it was 9.3ºC, which is perhaps too cold
for comfort. But Christmas, like the show, must go on, so we made tea and
breakfast and lit a bunch of candles and opened presents. Lots of books, lots
of chocolate and lots of Lego, so satisfactory all ‘round. Oh, and the girls
got rubber swords, which they immediately fought over. Of course.</p>
<p>After opening presents we went over to Baba’s house to warm up, do
the cryptic, read (me), knit (Delphine), and watch TV (Cordelia). I kept checking Twitter for news about the power, and at around 3:30 I got a text message from a neighbour to say we were back on. Hooray — we could sleep at home!</p>
<p>The biggest conundrum of the no-power Christmas was where, and if, Christmas
dinner would happen. Normally I host, and I was thinking about cancelling
dinner, but my sister-in-law is the best ever and offered to have it at her
place rather than cancel or postpone.  So I brought Christmas pudding and
cookies, and made Yorkshire puddings to go with the roast beef, and it was
delicious and perfect. And the evening ended very satisfactorily, in our own cozy little house.</p>

<p>Early Thursday morning our sweet Thomas died. He was twenty-one years old. </p>
<p>For the last day or so he'd been wheezing a little bit, and at about three in
the morning he was making so much noise with every breath that he woke us both.
He was curled up on the foot of the bed, his head bobbing up and down and his
abdomen sucking in with with the effort of every breath. There was a puddle of
urine on the floor; he had been too weak to go down to the basement, but was
still sweet and well-mannered enough to get off the bed to pee.  </p>
<p>I realized he would have to go to the vet right away, and I was pretty sure
this was it for him. Blake woke up the girls to say goodbye while I got dressed
and called a cab.</p>
<p>The receptionist at the vet called the triage nurse who took Thomas into the
back straight away. I was asked to wait in a examining room. After a few
minutes the vet came out -- she was short, pretty, youngish, a little plump,
with a pierced lip.</p>
<p>She said Thomas had fluid around his lungs --- pleural effusion. It might be
caused by heart disease, a tumour, or it might be idiopathic --- caused by
nothing in particular. Heart disease, after being confirmed by a cardiologist,
could be treated (with an unpredictable degree of success) with medicine. A
tumour could only be treated with surgery, and the only treatment for
idiopathic pleural effusion would be to drain it, keep Thomas in the clinic for
twelve hours, and see how long the fluid took to come back.</p>
<p>Surgery was out of the question, and I didn't see much point in putting Thomas
on yet more medicine. Draining and waiting would be torture. I asked for a
minute to talk to Blake on the phone, and we decided it was time.</p>
<p>The vet agreed that this was a sensible course of action, and the nurses
brought Thomas into the little examining room and gave me a few minutes to say
goodbye.  They brought a tank of oxygen so he wouldn't have to work so hard to
breathe, which was wonderful except it made him seem like his old self again;
he was breathing so easily, I didn't know if we had made the right choice. It
wasn't until he had his face away from the oxygen for a few minutes that he
started to wheeze again and I remembered how miserable he'd been.</p>
<p>I gave him lots of scratches, and whispered to him what a good cat he was, what
a handsome boy, how much we loved him and how much we would miss him. At first
he lay there, but soon he half-stood and start to nose around the examining
table. The vet had put in an IV line in his left foreleg, taped with blue
tape, and he shook his leg in irritation. I kept wanting to say "It's okay, it
will be off soon," but I couldn't. He gently head-butted me one, two, three
times. He was never very affectionate, but the awkward head-butt was his quiet
way of showing love.</p>
<p>Finally, after a lot of tears, the vet came in and talked a little bit about
what would happen. She let me stroke Thomas as she injected the drugs. He
didn't die as quickly as Mimi had -- she was gone before the syringe was
half-empty, but Thomas took a little longer. Not much, though; within seconds
his head came to rest chin-down on the table and he was still. His eyes were
open but empty, like the eyes of an Egyptian statue. He was still beautiful.</p>
<p>The vet let me have another moment alone with him; I kissed him on the head and
told him again that I loved him, then started to go out the door. I was about
to close it behind me but changed my mind and went back in for one more stroke,
one more kiss, one more look at my beautiful grey boy.</p>

<p>I've finally admitted that most of my non-kid-related posts to this blog are
about my struggle to use my time wisely, so I created a "time" category.
However, I'm not going to move all my old "time" blog posts into it. I just
don't have the time.</p>
<p>However, this post is a pleasant change from my usual moaning about not having
enough time. I have actually learned two things about
time.</p>
<h4>Slack</h4>
<p>A few years ago I read a review of Tom DeMarco's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123715.Slack">Slack</a>. I'm not sure
what the book is actually about (and I don't want to look it up right now lest
I lose track of my thought) but what I took away from the review is that piling
your employees with the absolute maximum amount of work they can handle is not
effective.  People and systems need enough available slack to deal with crises
as they arise. (Also people, especially people doing creative work, do some of
their best work when they have a chance to be idle, to chat with coworkers, to
just think. I'm pretty sure that I learned that since, though.)</p>
<p>At the time I thought the slack theory sounded very credible, mostly because it
validated my own work-related misery and exhaustion at the time. (In retrospect
that's laughable; I hadn't had kids yet and had <em>no idea</em> what being too busy
meant; I was miserable and exhausted at work for other reasons.) But it wasn't
until a couple of weeks ago that it occurred to me that the principal of
incorporating slack applies to individuals as much as it does to companies.
When your everyday life is crammed to the brim, you have no recourse when a
family member gets sick, a neighbour adopts a baby or a friend loses a parent;
you have to either abandon something important or let someone down.</p>
<p>At the moment my schedule is crammed full; between household maintenance and
childcare and child management and choir and school choir and friends and
working out and, of course, work, I have no slack. And there's 
nothing I want to give up. </p>
<p>However, I'm trying to let things fall away and not replace them. I have stuck
to my resolution to not take up the eco-committee chair position at school; I
have stubbornly refused to take on any other major school volunteer jobs;
I have even declined to arrange social events.</p>
<p>My plan, and I think it's rather clever, is to fill my slack time with a
space-holder hobby:
something worth doing but which I don't mind setting aside if I'm needed
for something more important. I have a needlework project which my father
started as he was beginning to sink into dementia; he abandoned it 
when he was moved into the nursing home, and I brought it home
with this summer. I want to finish it but I don't mind
how long it takes. That will be my time-space-holder. Just as soon as I find
some time to hold.</p>
<hr width="40%">
<h4>Time Panic</h4>
<p>In the October 5 issue of New Scientist Debora MacKenzie reviews three books
about pursuing happiness. Part of her review is about how scarcity inspires
obsession:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...the brain focuses ferociously on what it feels is lacking. This reflex
evolved to help us find what we need. The team's real insight is that it
applies to all scarcities, not just of money, but of time and even social
contact. We "tunnel" in on the scarcity and ignore anything outside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that scarcity messes with how we manage the resource in question. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The future looks less menacing than the scarcity we
face now. So we borrow money, then borrow more, disregarding future costs as
interest mounts, until we are deeply in debt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what I do when I feel overwhelmed with things to do. Instead of
taking the time to figure out how to best spend my time, I panic and
either avoid everything or just do the first thing I put my hands on, which is
sometimes helpful, and often not. At the end of the day I'm exhausted,
anxious, and no further ahead.</p>
<p>Uuh, I'm not sure what the takeaway is from this particular clue, apart from
that I need to notice when I'm flailing and take a deep breath. It might seem
like I don't have time to take a deep breath, but really I don't have time not
to.</p>
