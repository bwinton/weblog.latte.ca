It was the school Christmas break, the girls were home and I wasn't working so I wasn't on my computer much, and I was too busy to read Twitter on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I just... didn't get back on again. &lt;/p&gt;

Hah, no I don't. I do work out most days, though.  I didn't used to be a workout-every-day person. I got to this point through years of incremental changes and adjustments in my habits and attitudes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are impressed that I work out. They say, "I'm so impressed that you work out so often!" They say, "That's great, that you go to the gym every day!" It's one of the few things that I get randomly acclaimed for. (Of course, that says less about the magnitude of the accomplishment and more about what we value as a society.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But valued or not, exercise is profoundly important. If there is such a thing as a panacea, it's not aspirin or vitamin D or fish oil, it's exercise. It's good for your body, it's good for your brain, and it's good for your mood. Apart from the actual doing of it, there is no downside to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the trick, though, isn't it? The actual doing. The taking time out of your day, the sweating, the special clothes. It's a bit of a drag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to enjoy the benefits of exercise, you need to minimize the drag. This is how I manage it.&lt;/p&gt;

It came as a bit of a surprise. All my life I've felt a particular age, usually not my actual age,  and it's always been younger, as if I got 
stuck. For example, I felt 34 for at least three years after I stopped being 34, and I think the one before that was 27. 
This is the first time I've gotten ahead of myself: I feel like I'm about 44, and I keep being surprised that I'm only 41. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a rocky year. My last birthday was marked by picking up my family from the airport in Saskatoon, and picking up my mother's ashes from the crematorium on the way out of town. Then we stopped for burgers at A&amp;amp;W. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This birthday was marked by sharing a traditional memorial feast for (and with) our ancestors with good friends who also lost a grandparent on July 31. We had burgers.&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn't an unqualified disaster, though. Let's start at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year started off phone-free, because I dropped my phone down a drain in December 2013. I stubbornly tried to manage without buying a new iPhone, but I finally gave up and blew the $600 or whatever on an unlocked replacement. I'm much more careful with my phone outside, now, so I guess I grew as a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today would have been your birthday. It’s been three and a half months since you died, and I thought you might like an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that of all the places you’re likely to be (and I expect you’re probably not actually anywhere, although Shirley thinks you’re in the blue jays) the Internet is the least likely, so I’m not sure why I’m posting this online. Maybe, like everything else post-mortem, it’s for me, not for you --- on account of you’re dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope being dead is working out for you. Wouldn’t it be nice if there were really a heaven, and you could be with your dad and your sister again? Maybe even your handsome first husband, who you loved so much. (I didn’t find any pictures of him in your stuff --- but there were pictures of Dad’s first wife. You were way prettier.)&lt;/p&gt;

I tried to travel, and failed; the house ate all our money; my mom got sick. On the other hand, my mom got better (and we discovered how much fun it is when I visit her without the kids), and we got kittens.&lt;/p&gt;

I was on the way home from a meeting and thought the lights on house on a corner were so pretty, I wanted to take a picture to show the girls. I paused at the curb opposite the house, and took my phone out of my pocket. I still had my mittens on, but I needed my fingers to use the phone, so I wedged the phone in my left hand, wedged between my fingers and the fleshy base of my thumb. I used my fingertips and thumb to remove the mitten from my right hand, and as I did so the phone slipped, or my grip relaxed. For the longest second ever recorded, my phone fell toward the storm drain I had just realized I was standing above. &lt;/p&gt;

It’s a bit late. I meant to post this earlier, but then life… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And I realized that the reason you post your New Year’s Resolutions as soon as
you can is that it’s embarrassing to post them after you’ve already broken
them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;1. Increase my machine time at the gym from 20 minutes to 30 minutes.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My gym routine is almost literally the least I can do: twenty minutes on a
machine, usually the elliptical, and then fifteen minutes or more of
stretching. I’m really there for the stretching, because if I don’t do it
regularly sooner or later my back goes into spasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I figured another ten minutes can’t be too hard to come by, and a
bit more cardio three or four times a week can’t be a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;2. Double-veg&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another simple one: whenever I have fruit or vegetables, have twice as much.
I like fruit and vegetables, and it’s really only habit which stops me from
eating more of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;3. Write more.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is your classic poorly-planned, doomed-to-fail resolution. There is no
plan here, no list of steps, no schedule, just a vague intention to “write
more”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing specific, not a novel or poems or a book on the history of quick
breads, but more little things: more book reviews on Goodreads, more blog
posts, more letters to family, more entries in my journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this one needs more work. I don’t want to give it up,
though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/everythingelse/resolutions2014.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2014 14:28:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>2013 Year in Review</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/yearInReview/2013.html</link><dc:creator>Amy Brown</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this a little late, as it's already 2014. I suppose this
way I can be sure I'm not missing anything, as one never knows if 11:42 pm on
December 31 might be the highlight of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it wasn't. But at about that time someone did ask me what the highlight
of 2013 was, and I was stumped. I thought of our trip to Buffalo, but that was
in December; not even a month prior. So to write this post I'm going to have to
look at calendars, to-do lists, photos, old emails... Clearly my own brain
won't suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January I wrapped up work on &lt;em&gt;Shamans
Among Us&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;a href="http://josephpolimeni.com/"&gt;Joseph Polimeni&lt;/a&gt;. I edited and typeset the book, as well as
designing the cover and overseeing proofreading and website design.  It was
a fascinating book to work on; I learned a tremendous amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after &lt;em&gt;Shamans&lt;/em&gt; wrapped I set aside my editing work to join
Greg Wilson at &lt;a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org"&gt;Software
Carpentry&lt;/a&gt;. That's a big deal, really. It's my first regular, non-freelance
job since Delphine was born. 
It's so nice to be part of a team, to be useful and wanted for
something other than knowing where the clean socks are and what we're having
for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all did a lot of travelling this year, mostly by ourselves.
Delphine went to a few Guide camps and week-long sleepover camp in summer, and
Cordelia went to Brownie camp.  Blake went to Pittsburgh, London, Brussels, San
Francisco and Minneapolis, and I went to Portland OR, Boston, and London (but
not at the same time as Blake). The girls and I went to Saskatchewan in June,
and in December we all went to Buffalo, which &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; lame but might have been
the best trip of all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June my first-cousin-once-removed Emily came to visit with her boyfriend
Dan. I never met her before (I don't think? I feel like I should know this) so
that was pretty cool, because she's awesome and Dan is too.  The girls loved
them because Emily is from New Zealand and that's pretty much Middle Earth, and
because Dan played Lord of the Rings Risk with them. (Emily was also written up
in the &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/22/emily-does-chicago-new-ze_n_3314832.html"&gt;Huffington
Post&lt;/a&gt;, which is more than pretty much anyone else I know can say.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty uneventful year in review, so I guess 2013 was a pretty
uneventful year. I'm okay with that! I hope 2014 is also uneventful, and with
some interesting trips. And maybe more cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/yearInReview/2013.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2014 04:32:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Ice Storm Christmas</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/dayToDay/icestormxmas2013.html</link><dc:creator>Amy Brown</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, December 21 the girls and Blake and I went to a Christmas
carolling party at a friend’s house. We sang lots of old-fashioned Christmas
carols (the ones they don’t sing at school because there’s too much Christmas
in them) and drank wine and talked about the coming storm. “Charge your
phones,” I said, “make sure you have milk and bread!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is it going to be all that bad?” My friends moved here from England just over
a year ago — they weren’t here for the ice storm in Ottawa and Quebec
back in 1998.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It could be nothing, or it could be a few days without power,”
I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time we left it was raining, cold hard rain which was starting to
freeze on the ground. Blake walked us home and went out again to meet some
friends at a pub. I plugged my phone in, made sure my computer was
charged, tucked the girls in and headed to bed with &lt;em&gt;The Sea-Captain’s
Wife&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Sunday, December 22&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we woke up the power was out but the house was still warm.  I lit some
candles and boiled a saucepan of water for tea. I shuffled to the gym and
back, and the power came back on around 10:30. Easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- PICTURE: icy decorations --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city was covered in ice, part of the subway was shut down and people were being advised not
to go out if they didn’t need to, but Delphine and I had tickets for the
Sing-Along Messiah. When we heard at around 11:00 that Massey Hall was open and
the Sing-Along Messiah was on, we still weren't sure whether to go or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends who were going to come with us decided not to go --- they told a
very long story about a branch in their driveway and ice on their car and the
subway might not be running and it would be hard and they’d rather just not
bother. That was disappointing and we thought about staying home too, but we
decided that an adventure of any kind would be preferable to staying cooped up
at home being sullen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waiting for the bus, a lady shuffled towards us with unkemped hair and flushed
skin, sprinkling rock salt from a gallon jug on the sidewalk ahead of her. “The
subway isn’t running from Eglinton to Bloor,” she said. “No trains! They’re
running shuttle buses!” Again we thought about giving up, but decided to forge
ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Yonge Street three shuttle buses drove past, each too crammed to pick anyone
up.  A small CBC TV crew was shooting some B-roll of people giving up; Delphine
wanted to be interviewed for TV but they found someone less hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I decided to work around the Yonge Street problem altogether by
catching the number 14 bus over to the University-Spadina line. The number 14
was diverting from its usual route because of branches on the roads, too, but
it was only a twenty minute ride to Glencairn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- PICTURE: hobbit train --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subway train we caught at Glencairn was the Hobbit train, which pretty much
made the whole trip worthwhile.  We got to Dundas station ten minutes before
show time and didn’t miss a single note. Dame Emma Kirkby sang. (I wonder how
she enjoyed it.) There might have been a bit of a trainwreck in the Amen fugue,
but we pulled it together with lots of help from Ivars. Delphine had a good
time and she’s starting to learn the choruses and sing along. All in all,
going was absolutely the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the sing-along we wandered the mall with Janet, who had joined us for
Messiah, and then met Blake and Cordelia for dinner.  We ate at Mr Greenjeans,
our favourite mall restaurant. After a lot of food we went home and
noticed that it was very dark on our block; the power had just gone off again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Monday, December 23&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lights were still out Monday morning. I was supposed to go grocery shopping
for Christmas dinner ingredients, but the grocery store was closed. I’m
actually not sure what we did all day; cooking and washing dishes, tending to
candles. I wrapped Blake’s Christmas gifts in the basement by the light of a
single candle. I spent a lot of time checking the @TorontoHydro Twitter
account. The girls and Blake decorated their gingerbread houses, which they had
cleverly baked the day before the power went out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 8:45 pm on Monday, after the power had been out for over 24 hours, it was
16.3° Celsius in the house. People kept inviting us over to their house
to warm up, and I didn’t realize why until later when I heard that 
other houses cooled down to 10 degrees and lower within a day. I
don’t think there’s any one thing which made our house stay so warm; it’s a
combination of factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;really small house (about 1200 square foot)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a layer of rigid foam insulation on the inside of every outside wall
  (making the house even smaller)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;semi-detached, so one wall of the house
  is insulated by &lt;em&gt;an entire other house&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;protected on the north side by another house which is about three feet away&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;newish, small windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;honeycomb blinds &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, we have a gas water heater and a gas stove, so we were able to
warm the place up with hot showers and cooking. I'm feeling pretty good about
our little house these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Tuesday, December 24&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Christmas Eve morning it was 13.4°C when we woke up; it went up to
15.3°C by the end of breakfast. We went out for lunch and to see &lt;em&gt;The
Hobbit&lt;/em&gt;; when we got home the temperature had gone down to 11.4°C. We lit
some candles and made pasta for dinner, and managed to drag the temperature up
to 13°C before bed.  Blake and I had to stay up later than the girls
because of Christmas, but I lit lots of
candles and we managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- PICTURE: candles on mantelpiece --&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Christmas Day&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we woke up on Christmas Day it was 9.3ºC, which is perhaps too cold
for comfort. But Christmas, like the show, must go on, so we made tea and
breakfast and lit a bunch of candles and opened presents. Lots of books, lots
of chocolate and lots of Lego, so satisfactory all ‘round. Oh, and the girls
got rubber swords, which they immediately fought over. Of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After opening presents we went over to Baba’s house to warm up, do
the cryptic, read (me), knit (Delphine), and watch TV (Cordelia). I kept checking Twitter for news about the power, and at around 3:30 I got a text message from a neighbour to say we were back on. Hooray — we could sleep at home!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest conundrum of the no-power Christmas was where, and if, Christmas
dinner would happen. Normally I host, and I was thinking about cancelling
dinner, but my sister-in-law is the best ever and offered to have it at her
place rather than cancel or postpone.  So I brought Christmas pudding and
cookies, and made Yorkshire puddings to go with the roast beef, and it was
delicious and perfect. And the evening ended very satisfactorily, in our own cozy little house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/dayToDay/icestormxmas2013.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2013 04:17:08 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
