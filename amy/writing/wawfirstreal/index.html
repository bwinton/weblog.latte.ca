<p>I'm a writer. I can tell I'm a writer because I write. This blog,
mainly; I've been blogging since 
<a href="http://arbrown.latte.ca/journal/archives/">before it was called blogging</a>.
But blogging doesn't pay the bills (except for some people) and
if I am going to be a professional writer I have to improve.
Fortunately the blog provides the perfect place for me to 
practice.</p>
<p>I won't be modest: I'm a pretty good writer. I can turn a sprightly
phrase, I have a good vocabulary, I can make myself understood.
To some extent that comes naturally, but not entirely: I work on word
choice, and I excise cliches when I notice them, but it's easy,
and fun. What I don't do is plan the structure of what I write,
neither at the article (essay? post? paper?) level nor at the
paragraph level. I also don't revise deeply: when I write a blog
post my revision consists of reading it once or twice to smooth out any
egregious bumps.</p>
<p>In the interest of writing better, I'm reading a handful of
books about writing, and the first one is called <em>Ideas and
Details: A Guide to Writing for Canadians</em> by M. Garret Bauman
and Clifford Werier. It's targeted at a university audience, 
people who have to write papers on things, but it seems to me
that their advice is valuable for any writer. What I am concentrating
on at the moment is their advice on structure and revision.</p>
<p>What they say about structure is the same old stuff we learned
in Grade Seven (and Eight, Nine, Ten,...): figure out what
you're trying to say (your thesis) and make sure your whole
paper supports that.</p>
<p>You've already seen my first Real Writing Project: it's 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/everythingelse/regretDad.html">that post about my dad</a> I put up on Monday. I knew I wanted to write "something
about my dad", but you and I both know that "something about
my dad" is not a thesis. I charged ahead with writing it anyway,
and what I got was a bunch of disjoint paragraphs: about
how my dad and I are alike, about our relationship, about
the relationship we didn't have, about seeing my dad in 
the nursing home, about how I felt the day he died. I
couldn't make it make sense. In the past I would have just
cleaned up the grammar and spelling and posted it like
that, but this time I decided to work
with it and try and make it into something less amorphous.</p>
<p>I wrote down a brief description of each paragraph, cut them
up and shuffled them around to see if I could see some 
unifying idea. I brainstormed some thesis ideas and
narrowed it down to two: 1) grieving for someone with dementia
can start long before they die, or 2) I mourn more for the
relationship I didn't have with my dad than that I did.
Obviously I went with Door #2. I think Door #1 is interesting
and worth writing about, but most of the stuff I had already
written was about my (non-)relationship with Dad, and that was
what has been on my mind (for the last, oh, five years).</p>
<p>I rearranged my little paragraph slips of paper until I 
liked the flow, and then I rearranged what I had written
on the computer. I had to write some new stuff and throw out
some of the stuff which didn't work with my new thesis (I
was sorry to cut some of it because I was happy with the
writing, so I saved it to a "snippets" folder for when I write
more about my Dad).</p>
<p>Then I revised, more carefully than usual. <em>Ideas and Details</em>
wants you to revise five times:</p>
<ol>
<li>For ideas. Make sure you thesis still fits the paper.</li>
<li>For details. Add and sharpen details.</li>
<li>For paragraph structure. Is each paragraph about one idea?</li>
<li>For word use. Conciseness, vivid verbs, metaphors, precise word choice.</li>
<li>For spelling and grammar.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of those, 1 scares me the most. Once I come up with a thesis
I'm very committed to it and I hate the idea of making a big
left turn when I've already written something. But if your
paper doesn't match your thesis or your thesis turns out to 
be rubbish, your whole paper is rubbish. (Hopefully you've
already noticed that before you get to the end of the first
draft, though.) Anyway, since I had already rearranged and
rewritten my post with the thesis in mind, I didn't have
any problem with this step or the next.</p>
<p>I have never paid attention to 3 before. I have pretty good
instincts as a writer (from reading so much, I suppose) and
my paragraphs are usually naturally well-structured, but
now that I'm a Real Writer I can't rely on instincts and
nature, so I went over the post to make sure each paragraph
had one idea and some supporting details.</p>
<p>Obviously 4 is my favourite revision step, and I had to stop
myself from fiddling with words in every other revision step.
5 I didn't do properly (as you can see—I missed a word
and only noticed it today). I tend to rely on my natural
grammar and spelling talents and very seldom look things up.
Well, I look up spelling; I never look up grammar and
punctuation, as you might have noticed.</p>
<p>And that post is what I ended up with. I found that after all
that work on structure and paragraphs I was quite unhappy
with the whole thing; I felt it was stiff and didn't flow.
I posted it anyway, and on rereading it today it's not as
bad as I thought it was. I think I'm just not used to working
so hard on what I write. I suspect every writer hates everything
they write at some point in the process.</p>
<p>So that was the post-mortem of my First Real Writing Project.
Writing this post (which I didn't structure or revise, incidentally,
so you won't have to read a post about how I wrote <em>this</em>
post) has served as an excellent distraction from the business
of working on a real, pitchable article or pursuing business
writing leads. Result!</p>
