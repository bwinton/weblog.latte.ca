    I took a few more <a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/2003-01-25/">pictures</a> last weekend, and finally got the time to put them up on
the web.  Nothing too exciting, I don't think, but they turned out
reasonably well.  When I convert them to their final web-based format
I scale them down so that they're smaller than 800x700.  If that's
still too large, or too slow, <a href="mailto:bwinton@latte.ca">let me
know</a>, and I'll see about cutting it back further.  When I'm using
my laptop (which runs at 1024x768 (Shut up, you!)) I get about 15
pixels worth of scrollbar, but I don't know if that's because of my
overly large IE title settings, or if the pictures are actually too
large.

    <p>Well, mail works now, as does web and even the cute little
weblog script, but logging on an X session at the console fails
pretty heinously.  (Specifically, rxvt fails complaining that it
couldn't open the pseudo-tty, or could not obtain control of tty,
depending on what random bit I flipped before I tried to launch
it.)  Plain old xterm seems to work just fine, though.  More
debugging later, I guess.  For now, I'm just going to go to sleep.

    I've been playing around with the webserver here at <a href="http://www.latte.ca/">Latte.ca</a>, to see if there was an
easier weblogging tool that I could set up for people to use.
One product that caught my eye was <a href="http://www.plone.org/">Plone</a>, so I tried to set it up
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/">here</a>.  It turned out that
it required me to set up <a href="http://zope.latte.ca">Zope</a>
(A python-based web application server) first, so I did that too.
But after using Plone for about 30 seconds, I'm not convinced
that it's a good weblogging tool (mainly because it seems too
powerful, and not easy enough to use).  I'm not going to
uninstall it, but I think I'll stick with <a href="http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/">Blosxom</a> for now.
(Hey, maybe I'll install <a href="http://roughingit.subtlehints.net/pyblosxom">PyBlosxom</a>,
and see if it integrates with Zope at all.)

    <p>So <a href="http://www.phantomfiber.com">the company I work
for</a> has just released our <a href="http://www.covers.com/covers/mobile/mobile.asp">first
product</a>.  It took a lot of time and effort to get there, but
I think we did something good.  The main part I've been working
on these past few weeks was the "synchronized (offline) mode!"
part.  There are a lot of challenges to writing a Conduit for the
Palm Desktop, some of which come from our framework.  It was
really designed to be used in an application, with Models, and
Views, and asynchronous network calls.  I'm trying to use it in a
dll with no UI, no application, and synchronous messages.  It's a
bit of a mis-fit, but it mostly works.

    <p>So when I was writing the first iteration of the tiny web
browser I looked around on the Internet for stories from other
people who had done the same sort of thing, so that I could
hopefully avoid some of the dumber mistakes people had made, and
if I was very lucky, perhaps I might even pick up some tricks to
make my implementation smaller or faster.  Sadly, though, I found
nothing.  So I forged ahead with my design, and said that when I
was done, I would put my experiences up so that other people
didn't have to repeat my mistakes, and could possibly learn from
what I did correctly.</p>

<p>The first thing I think I did correctly was to break the
stream up into elements, all of which had content to paint, and
all of which had a bitfield of formatting flags.  In my gadget, I
would figure out the bounds for any given element, splitting a
long bit of content up into several lines each with their own
bounds.  When the time came to paint the html, I would just loop
through the elements, set the colour and font based on the format
flags, and draw the string at the bounds.  This made the drawing
extremely fast, which was a good thing.</p>

    <p>A while ago, I wrote an HtmlViewer component for the Palm.  It
was hard, and I made a lot of assumptions on the basis that we
would be getting our data from a server that we would also write,
so it made more sense to have the server do anything that was
necessary to the input stream to make it easier for the small
device to display.  (Things such as figuring out the widths of
table cells, and making sure that any start tag also contained an
end tag.  You know, simple stuff.)  The problem came when we
started using my HtmlViewer to display content that we got from a
client.  The content was a complete mix of tags, and had no hope
in hell of validating.  As well, the server guys were swamped
with other requests, and didn't want to write the code it would
take to fix the html up.  So my component broke.  Colin (a
co-worker) suggested that we just modify what I had to do what we
wanted.  After some discussion, I convinced him that it would be
faster to re-write what was there so that it didn't make the same
assumptions.</p>
