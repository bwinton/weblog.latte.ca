    <p>Yeah, like I was done messing with my iTouch.  Whatever.</p>

<p>I've been playing around a lot with the iTouch, and developing
quite a few programs for it.  The first one was by request, although
I’m also finding it very useful.  (And apparently a <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?p=4754458">few other
people</a> are as well!  Cool!)  It’s called <a href="http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/~chris/iphone/WifiToggle/">WifiToggle</a>, and it’s a small app that simply toggles on and off
your Wifi connection, so as to save batteries.  The next thing I did
was <a href="http://iphone.latte.ca/info/Javascript.html">a port</a>
of the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/">SpiderMonkey
Javascript</a> interpreter.  It works, and it wasn’t that hard to get
compiled and installed, which is really pretty cool when you stop to
think about it.</p>

<p>The final thing I got working just tonight (which I was playing
around with mostly to take my mind off of stuff.  See tomorrow’s post
for details), was <a href="http://iphone.latte.ca/info/GambitScheme.html">a port</a> of the
<a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Gambit Scheme</a> interpreter.  I know, Scheme is just like
Javascript, only with an uglier syntax, but I still like it, and
hopefully the lack of punctuation will make it easier to use on the
iTouch.  Heh.</p>

<p>Anyways, if you own an iPhone or iTouch, and have jailbroken it, be
sure to add <a href="http://iphone.latte.ca/">http://iphone.latte.ca/</a> to your list of Installer sources, and
geek out!</p>

    <p>Well, it’s official.  I just cancelled my cable service, effective
January 23rd.  I found that for the past few weeks, I really haven’t
been watching anything worth while, and $96.22/month is a lot to spend
to have the only thing on be the HD version of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/American_Gladiators/">American
Gladiators</a>.  (No, seriously, that’s what I’m watching right now.
Pity me.)  I’ld like to say that it’s the writer’s strike, and the
resulting lack of decent shows, or that I’m getting smarter and the
shows are appealing to me less and less, but really it’s just gotten
too expensive for the value I’m getting out of it.  Heck, maybe I’ll
take half of that money, and buy a couple of DVDs every month.  But
we’ll probably use it to pay down the Line of Credit that financed the
deck.</p>

<p>I can’t remember the last time I didn’t have cable of some sort,
and so I’m not really sure how I’ll be occupying my time.  Reading
books?  Reading the Interweeb?  Programming?  It’s a blank slate.
It’s all up in the air.  And if I end up spending all my time at my
sister’s house, watching her TV, then we’ll know I’ve got a bad
addiction, and should seek professional help.</p>

<p>Oh, I should also mention that the person on the other end of the
line was <i>really</i> nice.  She tried to figure out a way for me to
pay less, and still get the channels I wanted, (the best deal was
$19.95/month for channels 2-28 and 59-70, but that was only for 6
months, and it’s still $20/month I would rather spend elsewhere,) but
totally wasn’t pushy about it and was fine with me cancelling the
service outright.  I picked up the dial phone when they called me back
for the customer satisfaction survey, and so couldn’t complete it, but
I did want to make a mention of how helpful she was, and how well it
all went.</p>

    <p>On Friday and Saturday afternoon this week, I took some time out of my
day to go down to the University of Toronto and participate in the <a href="https://www.drproject.org/">DrProject</a> <a href="https://www.drproject.org/DrProject/mail/5059">Code Sprint</a>.  It
was a lot of fun, and I managed to fix a couple of bugs, and get a better
understanding of one of <a href="https://www.drproject.org/DrProject/browser/trunk/drproject?file=wiki">the hairier parts</a> of DrProject.  At least I hope it’s one of the
hairier parts of DrProject, since if the whole codebase is as ugly as the
wiki parts, we’re in some serious trouble.  To be fair, it’s a
not-entirely-deterministic parser for a not-entirely-deterministic
language, so when something goes wrong, it’s kind of, uh, tricky to figure
out what’s just happened.  For example, after parsing a link surrounded in
square brackets, the following character seems to be <a href="https://www.drproject.org/DrProject/ticket/1075">treated as
text</a>.  Why?  Who knows.  As someone new to the wiki parser, I’ld love
to have the code be simpler to understand, but I’m starting to suspect that
the complexity is inherent in what it’s trying to do.</p>

<p>The two bugfixes/feature additions I did, although they seem sort of unrelated, both work
together to let people create a bibliography/set of footnotes to pages,
which is something <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/">Greg</a> said
that he’s been wanting for a while, so that was kind of cool.  It’s nice to
be able to go somewhere, be surrounded by smart people, and concentrate on
making something better without interruptions.</p>

<p>Speaking of the bugfixes, they were:
  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.drproject.org/DrProject/ticket/870">adding
support for dl/dt/dd</a> in the wiki syntax, which turned out to be
surprisingly hard, since it seemed to be the first bit of syntax that
wanted to either return more than one tag or insert a tag into the
already-generated stream, so I had to figure out which option to go with,
and how to get it working, and</li>
    <li>coming up with and implementing a wiki syntax for <a href="https://www.drproject.org/DrProject/ticket/1038">creating and referring to anchors</a> in a page, which I think I did a
pretty decent job on.  The syntax uses [wiki:#foo] as an anchor, and
[wiki:MyPage#foo] as a link to that anchor</li>

    <p>I’m watching a video on my new iTouch about how to break web
applications, and it presented the idea that Javascript is the same as
stack overflows which are also the same as getting free phone calls by
whistling a note into a payphone…<br>
They're all examples of bad things happening when you intermingle code
(javascript/return addresses/command tones) and data (html/arrays on
the stack/your voice).  I guess it’s sort of expensive to set up two
connections for every connection, but that seems to be the only way to
avoid stuff like this, which has apparently been happening for
years.</p>

<p>I don’t think there’s a lot I can do with this new idea, but it
seemed interesting, so I figured I’ld record it for posterity.</p>

(or rather, the <a href="http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:VHKVDcZWQ4MJ:gegis.itsmart.fr/trac/browser/trunk/packaging/iphone/README.iPhone%3Frev%3D346+iphone+pyexpat+json&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=ca&amp;client=firefox-a">google

<p>So, that's a little surprising.</p>

<p>I tried to install easy_install, to try an "easy_install pyexpat", but
because I'm missing a Makefile, that fails with the following:</p>

<p>And that was the end of that.  Interesting, though...</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, and I ended up going with the iPod Touch (hereafter
referred to as the iTouch) to replace my Palm TX.  It's not the
perfect device, as the above stack traces show, but it's pretty good,
and a fair bit closer than the Palm TX was.</p>

    <p>At the Royal Winter Fair this year, Amy picked up a small bag of
malted barley flour, because she likes the taste of malt, and because
we have a recipe for malt bread which calls for malted (not barley)
flour.  We’ve since tried to use it in a few different loaves, and
while I quite enjoy the taste, as little as a quarter of a cup will
make the bread twice as dense as usual, and incredibly sticky to
boot.</p>

<p>It seems like it would be a useful thing to have, so that if you
had a bread that you knew was going to be a little dry for some
reason, you could just add a pinch of the stuff, and moisten it right
up, but I still haven’t figured out how little to put in to get a
slightly-moister bread which doesn’t adhere to the knife.  If I do,
I’ll be sure to post a comment, but until then, if you manage to get
some malted barley flour, be exceedingly sparing in your use of it,
and I’ll continue experimenting and picking bread out of my teeth.</p>

    <p>So I hit the Apple Store in the Eaton Center again today, to play
with the iPod Touch a little more, and now I’m kind of sad that I did.
There seem to be a few things about it that I don’t know if I can deal
with.  First, the screen apparently uses a <a href="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/ipod-touch2.htm">capacitive

touch it.  No slightly-longer-than-normal thumbnails, no left-over spare

fingers slightly smaller.  This turned out to be a little annoying when
I was trying to type.  I would probably get used to it if it weren’t for
the second problem.  Very few of the apps seem to support landscape-mode
text input.  Where by "very few", I mean "only Safari".  The keyboard in
portrait-mode is just a little too small for my fingers.  Bah, who am I
kidding?  The keyboard in landscape-mode is just a little too small for
my fingers.  The keyboard in portrait-mode is way too small for my
fingers.</p>

<p>So, I can’t really type on it.  That’s a fairly big problem.  But at
least I can download videos and music from my website, so that when I’m
at the office, and I see that my long DVD-to-iPod conversion has
finished, I can grab a copy of it over HTTP to watch on the commute
home…  But when I tried it, it was a total no-go.  None of the avis
worked, which isn’t totally surprising, but the mp3s in the same
directory also gave me the “Safari is unable to download this file”.
WTF?!?  An MP3 player that can’t play MP3s?  The biggest downside of
this whole trip is that I can’t really think of a good way around either
of those problems.  I mean, I guess text editors will come out which
allow landscape-mode keyboards, but it’s going to be annoying every time
I go to enter a new appointment, or contact.  And I don’t have any idea
what I could do to get around the no-downloading stuff. So I guess I’m
back to looking at other options (and maybe ending up asking Jeremy for
my SD Card back).  And no, I don’t think the Nintendo DS is a reasonable
replacement.  It’s too… game-y.  Not enough like an actual PDA.</p>

    <p><img align="left" src="../images/blake/OrangePalmLogo.gif"><img align="right" src="../images/blake/GreyPalmLogo.gif">A few weeks ago, I
was reading a pdf file on my Palm TX, when all of a sudden, it reset
itself.  Now, if that was the end of this story, then it would have been
slightly annoying, but nothing to post about.  However, that’s nowhere
near the end.  After resetting itself, it came back to the initial
orange Palm logo, as seen on the left, then it switched to the grey
PalmPowered logo, as seen on the right.  And there it sat.  And sat. And
sat…  The only thing I could consistently do is reset it, and every time
I did, it ended up on the grey screen, sitting there.  Soft resets,
debug resets, hard resets, zero-out resets…  Nothing could get it to
move past the grey screen.  On the off chance it was just taking a long
time to do its thing, I left it sitting overnight.  In the morning, I
opened it up expectantly finding… the grey screen again.  I read on the
internet that it might fix this problem if I left it sitting without any
power for a week, so I did, and the next time I plugged it it?  Yeah,
grey screen.  My heart was broken.  What could I do?<br clear="all"></p>

<p>I could call <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/support/contact/canada_repair.html">Palm’s
tech support</a>, and get a replacement!  It’ld only be $35 to get them
to ship one.  But when I called I found that I was way out of warranty.
Like, a year out of warranty.  So I decided not to go that route, since
it would be $150 to get it fixed, (or $185 to get the advance exchange,)
and I just don’t have that kind of money kicking around.  Then I
remembered that I had bought an extended warranty from the store, good
for a year after Palm’s warranty had run out, until Boxing Day of this
year.  Excellent, now I can just trade it in for a new one at the store.
But, I couldn’t find the receipt from two years ago, nor could I find
the credit card bill.  So I’ld have to figure out a way of getting them
to honour the warranty without knowing the warranty number.  That was
going to be hard, but in theory they had my information in their big
database, so it should be possible.  On the Monday morning, I was
checking through our filing cabinet one last time before heading off to
the store, and in the midst of a bunch of other receipts, (Why are we
keeping receipts for two year old meat purchases, anyway?  I’m pretty
sure that at this point, even if the meat was bad, we couldn’t return
it.) I found it!  So now, with all my ducks in a row, I left for the
store, <a href="http://www.compusmart.com/">Compusmart</a> at Yonge and
King.</p>

<p>Arriving at the store, I was slightly surprised to find the doors
locked, and a notice up from the landlord, saying that this location was
closed.  Apparently, some time in the past two years, Compusmart had
decided to close all of its Ontario locations.  Well, great.  What the
heck do I do now?  Getting to the office, I hit the internet, found a
phone number, got redirected to a different phone number, and then spoke
with someone who checked my warranty number (convieniently printed on my
two-year-old receipt), and said that they’ld send me some email which I
should sign and fax back.  Since there were no more Compusmart stores
left in Ontario, they couldn’t exchange the merchandise, and so they
were going to buy it back from me for the purchase price of $400!  I was
elated, until I realized that, because I had already done an early
exchange on this unit with Palm to fix an unrelated problem, the serial
number on the back of the TX was different than the one they had on
file.  And I bet that’s the sort of thing you would check if you were
going to send out a $400 cheque.  I called them back, and asked what I
should do.  They replied that I would need to get some sort of proof
from Palm that I had traded in the one unit for the other.  After
another set of phone calls and emails, I eventually got a PDF from Palm,
listing the date, and the early advance exchange, and the two serial
numbers, which I proceeded to forward off to the warranty company.  And
now I’m waiting for them to update my policy and send me their buyout
agreement so that I can fax it back to them, send them my Palm TX, and
get my $400.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I’ve got one of those problems people don’t mind
having.  I’m trying to figure out what to spend the money on.  Should I
get another Palm TX, with infrared keyboard, for <a href="http://www.softmagic.ca/_e/Palm/product/1047ML%2DBP3/%0APalm_TX_PDA_Handheld_w_WiFi_Free_Wireless_Keyboard.htm">$300</a>?
Basically replace my current setup, and pocket the extra $100?  Or
should I get something <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/canadastore.woa/">a little newer</a>?  That back there is supposed to be a link to the
iPod Touch. Specifically, the 16 Gig version.  (It’s really not, but
let’s pretend it was.)  It’s going for $449, which is a fair bit more
than I’m getting a cheque for, but…  If I go to the <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/">
American Apple Store</a>, I see that the price for the 16 Gig version
there is only $399 USD, or around $373 Canadian.  (Remind me, again, why
I’m paying $70 ($80 USD!) more for stuff just because I live in Canada?
Honestly, people, fix your freaking prices already!) And I know people
in the States who would be more than happy to ship it to me.  Heck, some
of them might even be coming up here for Christmas, and could just pack
it in their luggage.  Uh, where was I?  Oh, yeah, do I stick with the
devil I know, or do I go for the devil I don’t know?  I was leaning
towards the Palm TX recently, because there’s <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=2007092413051689">no
text editor/note taker</a> for the iPod Touch, and you <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/10/apple-confirms-ipod-touch-cannot-add-appointments/">can’t create appointments</a> in the Calendar
app, two things I kind of do a lot of.  But today I read about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mobiletextedit/">a text editor</a>, and a
<a href="http://www.modmyifone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=9507">way to
enable</a> the missing add-appointments feature.  Then I was worried
that the best way to view a PDF would be <a href="http://www.aimersoft.com/tutorial/download-dvd-pdf-youtube-videoto-ipod.html">to convert it to text</a>, but <a href="http://www.modmyifone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2665&amp;page=2">maybe not</a>.</p>

<p>I think the thing that finally convinced me was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/weboo/1547734040/">this picture</a>.
Yeah, I’m a huge geek.  What can I do?  (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/weboo/1557567120/">This picture</a>
didn’t hurt either.)</p>

    <p>If anyone out there has been trying to email <a href="http://arbrown.latte.ca/">Amy</a> or I, we haven’t gotten it.
While I was home alone with Delphine, I subscribed to a few podcasts
in iTunes, so that we would have a ton of new music to listen to, but
when I went back to work, I forgot to unsubscribe, and as a result
filled up my entire hard drive with music and videos.  This caused a
bunch of things to fail for various reasons, the most notable of which
being that no-one has recieved any email for the past few days.  I can
only hope that the various mail servers around the world will continue
trying to send the messages, but if there’s something urgent that you
really wanted a response to, you might consider re-sending it.</p>

    <p>I have no idea what happened to last night’s update.  Well, that’s
not entirely true.  I was at a FogBugz demo given by <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a>, and Delphine
had a sleep-over at her Baba and Zaida’s, so I took the time to write
<a href="http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/2.0/plans/archiveaccess.html">a spec</a>, and that led me to whip out a bunch of code.  The spec is
written in something called <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html">reStructuredText</a> (uh, that’s the link to the spec, which probably
<i>isn’t</i> the best way to learn about it, but <i>is</i> the
document I’ve been using the most), but my favourite Mac text editor
(<a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/index.shtml">TextWrangler</a>) doesn’t support it in any way, shape, or form.  So
I started writing <a href="http://bzr.latte.ca/files/restwrangler/head">a plugin</a> that
would teach TextWrangler what the heck reStructuredText was.  (You can
apparently get a tarball of the project from <a href="http://bzr.latte.ca/tarball/restwrangler/3">this link</a>, if
you’re so inclined, or if you’re not, you could just try <a href="../static/blake/reST.dmg">the compiled plugin itself</a>.  Just
double-click the .dmg file, then double-click the .bblm file inside of
it, and it’ll tell you what to do.  Or mail me, and I will.)</p>

<p>So yeah, a busy, busy night, but I got to sleep in until 7:00,
which was really nice.  Today was more of the same, except it was
really hot out when Delphine got out of kindergarten, so instead of
playing in the school playground, Delphine and I decided to go to <a href="http://www.torontolife.com/guide/food/dairies/hollywood-gelato/">Hollywood Gelato</a>, the local ice cream store.  Tasty.  Tomorrow
Amy gets home, so it’s looking like it’ll be a pretty busy day as
well.</p>
