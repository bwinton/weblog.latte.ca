<p>As <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/iTouch/languages.html">I mentioned</a> before, I’ve
ported Gambit Scheme to my iTouch, and have been playing around with
it a little.  It’s pretty nice all in all, but I recently ran into a
small problem while I was trying to play around with macros.  The
problem?  There’s no way to enter a backtick (`) on the iTouch!  That
means that I don’t really have a way to write code like</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="o">`</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nv">a</span> <span class="nv">b</span> <span class="o">,</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nv">d</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>which makes writing macros a lot more painful.  Fortunately, I got a
lot of help from the people on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/gambit">IRC</a>
and on the <a href="https://webmail.iro.umontreal.ca/pipermail/gambit-list/">Gambit mailing list</a>.
Specifically, Marc Feeley, the author of Gambit, <a href="https://webmail.iro.umontreal.ca/pipermail/gambit-list/2008-February/002011.html">posted</a>
a snippet of code that I could put into my .gambcini file that would
add $ as a synonym for `.  The code looked like this:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">begin</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">##</span><span class="nv">readtable-char-class-set!</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">current-readtable</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="sc">#\$</span>  <span class="c1">;; the character to dispatch on</span>
    <span class="no">#t</span>   <span class="c1">;; this character is a delimiter</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">re</span> <span class="nv">c</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">##</span><span class="nv">read-quotation</span> <span class="nv">re</span> <span class="o">#</span><span class="err">\</span><span class="o">`</span><span class="p">)))</span>  <span class="c1">;; handler</span>
  <span class="no">#f</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>and the example, which works, is:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="nv">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">,</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nv">output:</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>If you’re trying to write that code on your iTouch, you might notice that it
includes the forbidden `, and so you’re once again out of luck.  Except that
in this case, you can replace #\` with #\u0060, which you can type in on the
iTouch, and then it’ll all work.</p>

<p>Last night, I finally got the garage door open, after it had been
frozen in a block of ice for most of the winter, and got my bike out.
So this morning, I biked to work for the first time in, uh, I don’t
even know how long.  It was a pretty sweet ride, all in all.  There
were any number of reasons not to do it; my biking jeans are dirty,
it’s too cold, I couldn’t down-shift, but as always there was one
reason that trumped them all.  I wanted to ride again.  And so I did.</p>
<p>Some of the things I forgot about during my hiatus were how good that
first cup of coffee tastes after you’ve been riding in -5° weather,
what a rush it is to pass cars as they’re sitting, idling in
stop-and-go traffic, and how invigorated I feel when I finally get to
the office, and sit down.  Oh, also how sore my butt is.  Damn, that’s
a small hard seat.  I can’t wait to get used to it again.</p>
<p>Well, that’s about it.  I made it in safely, and I’m sure I’ll be
doing it again, and again, and pocketing the $22.50/week that would
have gone to the TTC, to spend on random upgrades.</p>

    <p>A while ago, I had bought an iPod Touch, and started messing around
with the CSS on this weblog, to try and get it looking a little nicer
on the small screen.  Sadly, it never quite worked, and because of a
bug in my selector (“min-device-width” should have been
“max-device-width”), I broke the weblog for Safari too.  Fortunately,
today, I grabbed a copy of the latest version of Safari, and fixed the
bug!  So now iPhones and iTouches will both get a pretty version of
the site, and Safari 3.1 looks beautiful again.  Even more beautiful,
now that SVG is supported.  (<a href="tech/doesThisWorkForYou">Give it a try</a>, and let me know if you can see the

<p>My company uses vss for our version control, (I know.  That should be

freeze for an impending release.  Thanks to bzr-loom, which I downloaded
and installed on my birthday (the 5th), I could continue to push ahead
with my work, and pop down and fix bugs in the frozen code when it
became necessary, and never lose my history, and not have to deal with
copying directories back and forth.  Heck, by adding a thread for each
proposed future VSS checkin, I even had a reasonable history in VSS
when it came time to check everything in.</p>

<p>Last night I was browsing the newest iTouch apps, and I saw one called
<a href="http://www.iamas.ac.jp/%7Eaka/iphone/#LEDBanner.app">LEDBanner</a>.  It
allowed you to scroll text across your screen as if your screen was a
set of LEDs.  My only problem with it was that I couldn’t
programmatically change the text.  Fortunately the source was
available, and so, with only minor changes, I now have <a href="../static/blake/LEDBanner.zip">a
version</a> which
lets me change the text to whatever I want.</p>
<p>For instance, the following scheme code:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8

(define (flmod x y) (fl- x (fl* (floor (fl/ x y)) y)))
(define (%100 time) (flmod (floor (time-&gt;seconds time))

(define (f)
  (begin
    (with-output-to-file
      (list

      (lambda () (display (%100 (current-time)))))
    (thread-sleep! 3)
    (f)))
(f)

<p>changes the text every three seconds to the number of seconds, modulo

<p>One of the things I wanted to add to <a href="http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/~chris/iphone/WifiToggle/">WifiToggle</a> was having the
icon show you whether your wifi was on or off, by having the switch be
up or down (and the blue glow be on or off, since in Australia a down
switch means that the light is on, whereas in Canada, it’s the
opposite).  Sadly, it didn’t seem possible, since Springboard<sup id="fnref:sb"><a class="footnote-ref" href="tech/iTouch/updatingicons.html#fn:sb" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
seems to cache your icon.png, and ignore any updates you do to it.
And so that was where I left it for a long time…</p>
<p>Recently, however, I was browsing through <a href="http://ericasadun.com/?p=176">AppFlow</a> and I noticed that the MobileCalendar
application’s icon was different than the one in Springboard.
Specifically, the one on AppFlow was blank, whereas the one in
Springboard showed me the current day and date (i.e. "Saturday" and
"1" for today).  How did it do that?  I grabbed the source, and
grepped through it for the answer, which turned out to be a special
key in the Info.plist:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>SBIconClass<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>SBCalendarApplicationIcon<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
</pre>


<p>When I set WifiToggle’s SBIconClass key to be the same, I too had the
day and date drawn on top of my icon!  Partial success!  So now I’m at
the point of trying to figure out if I can use any class that
implements the correct interface (I’m thinking specifically about
adding a class to my application to handle the updates.)  Of course, I
have no idea what that interface is, but hey, I’m way closer than I
was this morning, so that’s got to count for something.</p>

<p>And you’re done.</p>
<p>I guess you might be wondering why I would bother doing that, since
both Amy and I are obviously comfortable writing straight HTML.  Well,
<a href="http://www.drproject.org/">DrProject</a> is switching from a
custom-built Wiki-ish-syntax parser to a <a href="http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/">third-party</a> Markdown parser,
and I figured this would give me a bit of a headstart on getting used
to the new syntax, and also give me a bit of a playground for testing
out new features that I might want to add.</p>

<p>I was reading <a href="http://blogs.mathworks.com/images/steve/92/handout_final_icip2006.pdf">a presentation</a> about how to write better software for non-developers, and it said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would refuse to work on any sort of collaborative software
development project that doesn’t use version control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I totally agree.  Heck, I even use version control for my personal
one-off projects.  But it got me wondering what people use at their
jobs, so I asked my friends who were on instant messenger, as a straw
poll.  The results were shockingly unanimous.  <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>.  8 for 8.  I regret to say that I’m
not using Subversion at my job, but that may change someday.  In the
meantime, leave a comment, and tell me what you’re using at work or at
home, either to make me feel better, or to rub my nose in it.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: One person uses Clear Case.  I’ve heard good things about
Clear Case.</p>

    <p>Today, at 3:20, Amy and I took Mimi to the vet, and had her put
down.</p>
<p>It’s really hard, and I’m finding that I have to kind of pull back
from it for a while, or I’ld be totally bawling all the time I’m
writing this.</p>
<p>She was cranky, rude, ill-tempered, and maybe a little mean
(although never to me).  But I did love her, and she really seemed to
be getting worse, and not enjoying life anymore, and so I think that
it is the right decision, hard though it is.  Heck, just looking at
her, sleeping on the sofa beside me last night, I could totally see
that she wasn’t right.  She was in pain, and wasn’t happy anymore, and
didn’t have much of a prospect of getting better.  (Certainly not
while we weren’t willing to spend $1000’s of dollars treating cancer.
Chemotherapy seems like a cruel thing to put a cat through.)  She’s
also the first pet I’ve ever had to put down.  I was sad when the rats
died, but this feels totally different, probably because we’re doing
it by choice, instead of it happening on its own time.  I guess I just
figured that she would disappear one night, and I could delude myself
into thinking that she found another home, but it’s probably better
this way.  More of a sense of closure, and all that...</p>
<p>She went really quickly, (really really quickly,) which was a
blessing, and the vet agreed that she was on her way out, and that we
probably did the right thing at the right time.</p>
<p>I can also see why people believe in God and Heaven and stuff.  I
would kind of like to believe that Mimi has gone to some sort of
better place, but I know in my heart that she hasn’t.  That she’s just
gone.  And it sucks.</p>

<p>On a happier note, there are a lot of things I want to remember
about her, both good and bad.  The way her head smelled of ginger and
cinnamon.  The time she made Kathryn cry while she was babysitting for
us.  How loud and incessant her purr was.  The way she would always
hiss and swipe at Colin when we were all working in my living room.
How soft she was under her chin.  The way she let Amy (and only Amy)
comfort her after spending a night at the vet.  Heck, I even want to
remember the way she would scratch her ass on the rug, and complain
when I wanted to sit down on my couch.  Damn stupid cat.  I loved
her.</p>
