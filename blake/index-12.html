    <div>
<p>Yesterday I went to see a presentation by Kosta Zabashta about the
work he did on Basie.  The presentation went fairly well, but while
listening to it, I had a few ideas that I thought I should write down.</p>
<p>First, since the configurations for Exim and Postfix are so
complicated and so different, it would be nice if we had a program
that could figure out which one you’re running, and generate the lines
to add to your config files to get it all set up.</p>
<p>Second, I think we probably don’t need to add that many boolean or set
operators to the search functionality.  I seem to remember reading a
paper a while ago where Google said that people only used 2 of the
advanced search features, "s to make a phrase, and OR to choose
between two different things.  Sure, some people used all the wacky
operators, but it was a vanishingly small percentage.</p>
<p>Third, do we update the search index when items change, or are we
constantly rebuilding it?  I would have thought that doing the dynamic
updates would have run into many of the same issues as the Events app,
but maybe there was a smarter way to do it that I’m overlooking.</p>
<p>Fourth, and finally, I wonder if there’s a way to use metadata about
the objects we’re searching to influence rankings.  To take the Google
approach, add the number of mail messages/commit logs/wiki
pages/tickets that refer to an item as a factor in determining the
ranking.  Or, push more recent things higher in the search results,
since we know when things were added.  Do we actually want to do
either of those?  Maybe, maybe not, but we’ve got a lot of data about
each item, and it seems like using it might be, well, maybe more
interesting than useful.  :)</p>
<p>So, there are my thoughts on stuff we might want to do for the next
version of Basie.  I suppose the next step will be to get Greg to link
to this, and get other people commenting.  (And now that I’ve written
it all out, I suppose it might have been cleverer to post this to the
Basie blog.  Ah well.  Live and learn.)</p>

<p>Okay, one game in particular this time.  One of my favourites from
back in my Palm days.</p>
<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=297288395&amp;mt=8">Bike Or Die 2</a>.<br><img alt="I can totally land this!" src="../images/blake/iTouch/BikeOrDie.png"></p>
<p>It’s awesome.  It’s harder than I remember the Palm version being, but
that's probably as much because I'm out of practice as anything else.
After a couple of weeks of playing the beta version, I’m now at the
point where I rarely hit the wrong button, even though they're
on-screen instead of being hard buttons.</p>
<p>Not only is it a great game for what it is, but it’s got a ton of
<a href="http://bike.toyspring.com/levels.php">user-created levels</a>, and an
online <a href="http://bike.toyspring.com/view.php">high score board</a> (which
I’m <a href="http://bike.toyspring.com/player.php?p=35">nowhere near</a> the top
of).  The re-playability of this game is stunning.</p>
<p>If you're still undecided, you can read <a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=1318">the
thread</a> about it
on TouchArcade.  (Yeah, I’ve been answering a bunch of questions over
there.)  There’s also <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bikeordie">a video</a> showing
gameplay from the beta.</p>
<p>Finally, it only costs $2.99, but I hear it’s going up to $7 after the
introductory period is over.  (I suggested he sell it for $7.99-$9.99,
but he’s apparently a nicer person than I am.)</p>
<p>(No, he’s not paying me for this.  Heck, I didn’t even get an iTunes
gift certificate for all my hard work finding bugs.  I just really
like the game.)</p>

<p>A co-worker recently got a new iPhone, and I since he didn’t have many
apps on it yet, I thought I’ld send him a list of the stuff I had
bought/downloaded and enjoyed.  So, without any further ado, here are
a few of my favourites, all available on the AppStore.<sup id="fnref:appstore"><a class="footnote-ref" href="tech/iTouch/games.html#fn:appstore" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>As Amy mentioned in the previous post, her father passed away.  So she’s
gone out to Saskatchewan to spend some time with her mother.  This means
that for the next seven days, I get to stay home and take care of the
kids, making sure that they have food to eat, clothes to wear, and get
to wherever they’re going when they need to be there.</p>
<p>The first day went pretty well, the only casualty being a
slightly-charred side of a grilled bacon-tomato-cheese sandwich.  And
today has been going pretty well too, with a load of laundry washed and
hung, the dishwasher currently running, and tonight’s meal (beef stew in
the crock pot) already cooking.</p>
<p>A large part of why it’s all running so smoothly is my parents.  They
have totally stepped up, helping me by taking Delphine and Cordelia
places, or just looking after them while I do the stuff that needs to be
done around the house.</p>
<p>Delphine has been a huge help too.  This morning, while I was in the
shower, she got dressed, came downstairs, got out three bowls and three
small spoons, some cereal, and the milk from the fridge.  She then
poured cereal for herself and Cordelia, and the two of them were done
breakfast before I was dressed.  I know she’s five and all, but
sometimes she’s so grown up it astonishes me.</p>
<p>Anyways, they’re currently out on an adventure with Zaida, so I’ld
better get to folding the laundry, because it ain’t gonna fold itself.</p>

<p>So, first off, I think Python developers these days need to use stuff
like virtualenv and zc.buildout in order to develop in a sane manner.
Yeah, this is the first project I’m using them on, but do what I say,
not what I do.</p>
<p>Anyways, on to the instructions.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>sudo easy_install virtualenv
virtualenv --no-site-packages basie
cd basie/
. bin/activate
</pre>


<p>Then, you’re gonna need a
<a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/Programming/Basie/buildout.cfg">buildout.cfg</a>.
Mine looks like this:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre> 1

<td class="code">

</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>You’ll also need a
<a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/Programming/Basie/bootstrap.py">bootstrap.py</a>,
which will look a little something like this:</p>

Today, I finally reached 5000km of biking.  I forgot the camera, so I
don’t have a picture of the odometer at exactly 5000.0, but I took
this one when I got home, and it’s close enough.  I guess that’s all,
but I wanted to throw up a picture, as proof.  So here you go:

<p>A few days ago, the city closed <a href="http://tinyurl.com/69xc2l">the pedestrian
bridge</a> at Summerhill (and MacLennan) in
order to tear it down and replace it.  Since then I’ve been trying to
find a way across the railroad tracks that doesn’t involve taking a
major road.  And I’ve totally failed.  So from now until September
28th, I’ll be biking down Bayview and turning right on Nesbitt before
dispy-doodling my way over to Glen Road.  It’s not my favourite route,
since the traffic on the Bayview Extension is going a fair bit faster
than I’ld like to, and the lane isn’t wide enough to share at those
speeds (and the right-hand side of the lane is brutally cracked and
very difficult to ride on, particularly at 50 km/h), but I still think
it’s better than Mt.  Pleasant.</p>
<p>Looking closer at the map, there <em>might</em> be another route, if I can
get into the path leading South from <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5vkh8y">David A. Balfour
park</a>…  Yeah, that might be a route to try
on my way home tonight.  I’ll reply with a comment, letting both of
the people who read this know how it was.  ;)</p>

<p>This year, <a href="http://arbrown.latte.ca/">Amy</a> and

<em>I</em> decided to try the Tour de Dufflet, and convinced Amy to come along
with me, but that’s the same, right?  I took a few
notes<sup id="fnref:route1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="random/biking/tourdedufflet2008.html#fn:route1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:route2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="random/biking/tourdedufflet2008.html#fn:route2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:route3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="random/biking/tourdedufflet2008.html#fn:route3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:route4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="random/biking/tourdedufflet2008.html#fn:route4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:route5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="random/biking/tourdedufflet2008.html#fn:route5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> on which routes would
be less likely to have a lot of traffic on them, and after my parents
picked up Delphine and Cordelia, we set out.  46 km and 4 hours later,
we arrived home, tired, sore, and full.  I think it was mostly a
success, although Amy was certainly done having fun by the time we were
on the third leg.  The stats were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average speed: 15.0 km/h</li>
<li>Total distance: 46.18 km</li>
<li>Biking time: 3:04:32</li>
<li>Total time (including eating cake): around 4 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve got to say, I’m really pretty impressed with how well Amy did.  To
go from virtually no bicycling to a 46 km trek (and a 46 km trek with a
self-admitted speed freak) is something that a lot of people would skip
out on, or avoid, but she went for it, and went faster than I hoped she
would.  Would we do it again next year?  My guess is no, since it wasn’t
a lot of fun at the end.  On the other hand, if Amy continues to bike
throughout the year, she might just go for it, to see if it’s gotten any
easier.  (I’m hoping to do it next year, as you might have guessed from
the url of the post.)</p>

<p>I knew when I woke up this morning that it would be an annoying ride
in.  It was raining fairly hard, but there was a breakfast at <a href="http://www.thebikejoint.com/">The
Bike Joint</a>, and they usually have one
of the better breakfasts.  It’s the same coffee, muffins, bagels, and
fresh fruit as filling.  As it turns out, this year they got an
espresso machine, so instead of the normal coffee, I had a very nice
latte along with my chocolate chip muffin, but along the way I got
almost completely soaked and tore a hole in the crotch of my biking
jeans.  The hole wasn’t a complete surprise; the other side had gone a
couple of weeks ago, and I had patched it with some old t-shirt.  I
guess it’s time to re-do the patch, and extend it to cover both sides.</p>
<p>Anyways, I got there, had some coffee and a muffin, and as I got on my
bike after crossing the street when I noticed that my rear wheel
didn’t really feel right.  I looked behind me and found that it had
gone completely flat while I was standing around eating breakfast.  I
wheeled the bike back to <a href="http://www.thebikejoint.com">the store</a>,
Derrick replaced the tube, and I was on my way just as it started to
rain again.  And then my front light fell off and broke into three
pieces.  Fortunately, that was easy enough for me to snap back
together, and be on my way once more.</p>
<p>After all that, I ended up being late for the 10:00am Status Meeting
at work, which was the cherry of annoyance on top of the annoying
ride.</p>
<p>The rest of the day, so far, has gone much better.  I listening to a
not-particularly-interesting <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5oag85">talk</a> about
bicycle touring at <a href="http://www.mec.ca/">MEC</a>, and while I was there
bought a bell.  My current bell works just fine, but it’s one of the
<em>ding</em>-<em>ding</em> ones, and no-one seems to recognize it as a bike bell,
so I got one that goes <em>ringggg</em>-<em>ringgg</em>, which is the canonical bike
bell noise, and I hope that’ll help.  Work is good too, if a little
busier than I might like.  And I finally got emacs working with
Markdown pretty much the way I want, so all in all, woot!</p>
<p>(Update: The ride home went mostly well, although there were spatters
of rain throughout the trip.  Around Sherbourne and Bloor, my rear
tire started to slow wayyyy down, and then stop.  When I flipped the
bike over, I noticed that it was jammed right up against the frame, so
I loosened it, straightened it, re-tightened it, and kept on going.
Still, that’s never happened to me before, and was pretty strange.)</p>
