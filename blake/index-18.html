recently, and it occurred to me that when I’m playing, I basically act like an
orc — cutting down all the trees, digging up all the stone, killing all the
animals — all so that I can build whatever fancy strikes my mind.</p>
<p>In my normal life, I bike (or take public transit) for all my trips; I recycle
cans, bottles, cardboard boxes; I compost vegetables in my back yard, and
other organic waste through the city’s compost program; I keep the house
fairly cool in winter, and we barely ran our (window) air conditioner at all
this summer.  But as soon as I log on to the server all the normal behaviour
is right out the window.</p>
<p>Maybe when I build a house of my own, I’ll try to only use sustainable
materials, and see how it is to live in a Minecraft world…</p>

door, and thought “Nice!  They must have put that in so that people wouldn’t
slam the door into other people when they opened it.”  But now I find myself
thinking “Nice! They probably put that in so that people wouldn’t slam the door
into other people when they opened it, but it also has the beneficial effect of
letting <span title="women">people</span> know if there’s someone lurking in the

<p>People love <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/ux/2012/06/firefox-heatmap-study-2012-results-are-in/">heatmaps</a>.</p>
<p>They’re a great way to show how much various UI elements are used in relation
to each other, and are much easier to read at a glance than a table of click-
counts would be.  They can also reveal hidden patterns of usage based on the
locations of elements, let us know if we’re focusing our efforts on the
correct elements, and tell us how effective our communication about new
features is.  Because they’re so useful, one of the things I am doing in my
new role is setting up the framework to provide our UX team with automatically
updating heatmaps for both Desktop and Android Firefox.

<p>I’ve recently been playing a lot of <a href="http://www.fezgame.com/">Fez</a>, a 2-D
(kinda) platforming/puzzle video game.  Many of the puzzles use a series of
symbols in squares as a <a href="http://evilwallpaper.co.uk/fez/">code language</a>.  I
really liked the way the language looked, and so I decided to write a small
single page app in Angular to transliterate English into the Fezish alphabet.
The first implementation was written as a filter, and it seemed to work okay,
but emitting a bunch of HTML and then forcing the user of the filter to use a
sanitizer to get it to render <em>as</em> HTML was kinda strange. That very same day,
in an odd twist of fate, I got some email from <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/">Packt
Publishing</a> asking if I would be interested in
featuring their <a href="http://bit.ly/13VlkXc">new Angular JS book</a> on my blog.  Long
story short, I agreed to post a review of it here in exchange for a free copy
of the eBook.  So on to the review…</p>
<p>The first thing that struck me about Angular JS Directives was the writing.
I’ve read a lot of extremely dry technical books which were hard to get
through, and I’m happy to say that this is <em>not</em> one of them.  I found the
writing both engaging and amusing.  There are a few times where the author
even pokes fun at himself for repeating the same points, which was wonderful
to see.  The examples were clear to read, and ably demonstrated the points
that the accompanying text was making.  The overall flow of the book mostly
made sense, with simpler concepts leading to more complicated concepts.  My
only suggestion is that the chapter on Testing could have been introduced
sooner, and then used in the rest of the examples to prove things were working
the way that the author claimed.</p>
<p>I don’t like to only say positive things about something I’m reviewing, both
because I believe that there’s always something that could be done better, and
because I don’t want to look like a corporate shill.  At least not for $17.
;)  So, on to the bad things I’ve run into.  It took me a lot longer to read
than I would have hoped.  This was partially because of a bunch of work stuff
taking up all my spare time, but also because after every few pages I wanted
to go back and re-write large parts of the projects I’ve done.  :)  My other
concern is that $17 for 87 pages of content might not not be worth it to you.
I found the content very useful, and I’ve certainly gotten $17 worth of
knowledge out of it, but at my previous job, where I didn’t use any JavaScript
much less Angular, it wouldn’t have been money well spent.</p>
<p>Having said all that, after the fourth chapter, I re-wrote the Fezish Filter
as a Directive, and the code became far cleaner.  And now that I’m done
reading the ninth chapter, I think I might spend the rest of this weekend
adding some unit and end-to-end tests.  So in the end, would I recommend <a href="http://bit.ly/13VlkXc">this
book</a>? Yes.  Yes I would.</p>
<p>(Monday October 14th edit: I’ve also just been informed that Packt is running a
<a href="http://bit.ly/1bqvB29">Columbus Day sale</a>, and if you use the discount code
"<strong>COL50</strong>" in the next four days, you’ll get 50% off this, and any other eBook
or video, so if you’re thinking of buying it, today would be a great day to do
so!)</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/firefox/cssLines.html">previous blog post</a>, I mentioned a tool
I’m writing to make it easy for designers to link mockups to live bugs.  But I
didn’t mention that I had a reasonably-working version of the tool written in
<a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> which I’ve decided to port to <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>.  The reasons why are largely beside the point of this
blog post, but I’ll try to sum them up by saying that I reached a point where
Backbone seemed to be confusing me more than helping me, and Angular got a
<em>lot</em> of good press at <a href="http://fluentconf.com/fluent2013">FluentConf</a> this
year.</p>
<p>So this morning’s task in <a href="https://github.com/bwinton/arewecreatingyet/commits/feature/angular">the re-write</a> was to
re-hook up the <a href="https://login.persona.org/about">Persona</a> integration.  I had
read recently that when you had a lot of dom-manipulation functions, you should
probably put that code in a directive, and since I hadn’t written an Angular
directive yet, I figured this would be a great time to learn how.  Writing <a href="https://github.com/bwinton/arewecreatingyet/blob/feature/angular/views/index.html#L30">the
html</a>
was pretty easy, of course, and most of the code from the existing
implementation (which was largely based on the code from the <a href="https://github.com/jbuck/express-persona/blob/master/README.md">express-persona
readme</a>) could
be ported over fairly quickly.  The only tricky part I ran into was figuring
out that I needed to include <a href="https://github.com/bwinton/angular-tools/blob/master/persona.js#L36"><code>restrict: 'E'</code></a> in the
<a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive#directivedefinitionobject">Directive Definition Object</a>.  After I
was done, I noticed that there really wasn’t that much in the code that had
anything to do with the tool I’m writing, and thus I pulled it out into a
separate repo so that other people can use it.</p>
<p>And with that, I announce <a href="https://github.com/bwinton/angular-tools/">Angular-Tools</a>, a repo containing one or more tools
which you might find useful if you build Angular apps.  As always, pull
requests and bug reports welcome!</p>

<p>One of the things I’m working on as part of my job<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="tech/firefox/csslines.html#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> at Mozilla is <a href="https://github.com/bwinton/arewecreatingyet">a tool</a> to make it easy for designers to
create mockups that are linked to live bugs, similar to the ones at <a href="http://areweprettyyet.com/4/mainWindow/#">Are We
Pretty Yet</a>.  Now, I’ve got the
background showing up, and the bugs overlayed on top of it, but as it stands,
I’m requiring the designers to draw the lines connecting the bugs to the
various areas in the mockup right on the mockup itself!  This is obviously a
fairly terrible idea, since it makes it much harder than it should to move
stuff around after the fact, and requires a ton of up-front planning when
creating the initial image.  But what are my other options?</p>
<p>I thought for a while about layering a canvas element over the mockup; it would
let me draw whatever shapes I wanted to, but passing the click events through
to the mockup seemed like it would be fairly annoying, and I don’t think the
connecting lines should appear in front of the boxes showing the bug details,
which adds another wrinkle.  Then, over lunch, I started to wonder what it
would look like if a 1px by 1px black square got stretched and rotated with
CSS…  So I took some time after lunch, and played around a little, and it seems
like it just might work!  <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/aBjp7/8/">Give it a try</a>, let me
know if you have any ideas to make it better, and feel free to take the idea
anywhere you think it might be useful!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> In the comments, Andrew points out that I could use a 1px by 1px
span instead, which would make it <em>much</em> easier to change the colour of the
line, so I’ve linked to his jsfiddle instead.  :)</p>

<p>For a while now, I’ve been having problems with my Firefox profile.  To be fair,
it’s mostly because of random <a href="about:config">about:config</a> tweaks I’ve made, but
still, not being able to test the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2012/11/20/firefox-introduces-new-social-api-and-previews-integration-with-facebook/">new SocialAPI</a> stuff was pretty annoying.  So I decided to try <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/reset-firefox-easily-fix-most-problems">resetting my profile</a>,
to clear out all the junk, and hopefully even make it a little faster.</p>
<p>But, as the page I linked to just up there mentions, resetting your profile will
lose your open tabs, windows and tab groups, which kinda sucks, because I have
57 open tabs, in various groups, and I really don’t want to lose them!
Fortunately, I’m a programmer, so I hacked on Firefox to get it to save and
restore my tabs, and now I’m a happy camper!</p>
<p>A couple of days later, one of my co-workers had some similar problems, and also
wanted to re-set his profile to try and fix them.  I hadn’t saved the results of
my hacking, so I had to re-create it for him from a combination of memory and
the documentation.  The new code I came up with looked something like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">gBrowser</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">tabs</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">rv</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"var tabs = [\n"</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">rv</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="s1">'  "'</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nx">linkedBrowser</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">contentWindow</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">location</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">'",\n'</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nx">rv</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="s1">'];\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; tabs.length; i++ ) {\n'</span>
<span class="nx">rv</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="s1">'  gBrowser.addTab(tabs[i]);\n}\n'</span>
</pre>


<p>To run it, first open <a href="about:config">about:config</a>, and make sure the
<code>devtools.chrome.enabled</code> preference is set to <code>true</code> (double-click it if it
isn’t, and it should switch automatically), then go to the <code>Tools » Web
Developer » Scratchpad</code> menu item, which should open up a small new window with
some javascript comments in it.  While that window is focused, click on
<code>Environment » Browser</code>, to make sure that you’re running the code in the
browser’s chrome (instead of in the page’s content).  Paste the code in, and
click <code>Execute » Display</code>.</p>
<p>That should result in a bunch of code in grey surrounded by <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> that
looks like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">tabs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
<span class="s2">"http://weblog.latte.ca/blake"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="s2">"http://breakingtheegg.tumblr.com/"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">];</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="nx">tabs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">gBrowser</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addTab</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">tabs</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">]);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre>


<p>Copy that out of the scratchpad into your favourite editor, remove the <code>/*</code> and
<code>*/</code>, and run the profile reset.</p>
<p>Once you’re done resetting your profile, you’ll need to change the
<code>devtools.chrome.enabled</code> preference to <code>true</code> again, and then re-open the
Scratchpad, paste the new code you saved back in to it, click on the
<code>Execute » Run</code> menu item, and <strong>shazam</strong>!  All your tabs should be back
(although they won’t be in their original tab groups.  If anyone needs me to
figure out how to do that, just let me know, and I’ll give it a try).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/bwinton/australis-customization/">side-project</a> I’m working
on is coming along nicely, and so I figured it was time to let other people
see it.  Now, I could just have everyone huddle around my screen, but since
many of the people who would be interested aren’t in the same city (or even
same timezone) as I am, that wouldn’t work out so well.  We tried screen-
sharing, but a lot of what’s being worked on is animation, and the frame-rates
of the screen-sharing application we were using weren’t up to the task.  To
get around that, I could have recorded a video, but since a lot of the value
of a prototype like this is being able to play around with it, that’s also not
a great solution.  So, obviously, the best thing to do would be to put it on a
publicly available server, and let people run it in their own web browser,
whenever they wanted!</p>
<p>Now, I’m running a server or two that I could put it up on, but since the
project is related to Mozilla, and since Mozilla offers some personal webspace
on <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/">one of their servers</a>, I figured I might as
well put it up <a href="https://people.mozilla.com/~bwinton/australis/customization/mac/?scroll">there</a>.  :)</p>
<p>So, to make it easy for me to remember to build and upload the code (and to
prevent me from trying to figure out all the correct options to rsync every
time I wanted to upload the code), I took a couple of minutes to <a href="https://github.com/bwinton/australis-customization/blob/master/australis/customization/mac/volofile#L23">add a
command</a> to my volofile, which lets me merely type <code>volo deploy</code>, and have it
optimize the code, and copy only the changed files to the remote server.</p>
