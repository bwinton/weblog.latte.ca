    <p>It's 4:00 on the Friday before I leave for a week-long vacation,
and all of the management-types and sales people left the office an
hour or so ago.  And I'm so bored, it isn't even funny.  The online
forum I usually read isn't being entertaining enough, and I'm not even
getting deluged with email.</p>

<p>I suppose not doing anything isn't really a good reason to
complain, but dammit, I can feel my brain dissolving, and my will to
do anything slipping away.  And I'm not sure why, but I can't bring
myself to play a few rounds of <a href="http://www.diabloii.net/">Diablo II</a> to pass the time.  And
so I sit, and mindlessly surf the InterWeeb, and chat with whomever's
in the chat room, and wonder how long the construction people in the
office below us will be hammering on our floor.</p>

<p>Hmm.  Perhaps writing an entry about being bored isn't as exciting
as I thought it might be.  Time to switch the topic.  Amy and Delphine
and I are going to visit Amy's parents in Sasketchewan tomorrow
morning.  We'll be gone for a week, and it should be quite fun, since
Amy's parents haven't seen Delphine before.  (Well, they've seen
pictures, but that's hardly the same.)  It's tough to try and decide
what we're going to take, with the added constraint that most of the
stuff we use on a day-to-day basis just isn't going to fit in our
luggage.  (Stuff like the high chair, or the stroller, or the bed rail
that keeps her from falling out of our bed, or even the play mat that
she rolls around on.)  What are we going to do without all the
conveniences of home?  And where are we going to go to hang out in a
city that doesn't have a Starbucks or a Second Cup, or even a Tim
Hortons?  (There is a local coffee shop, but its non-smoking section
wasn't separately ventilated, and noticibly smelled of smoke the last
time we were there.  I don't consider myself a non-smoking Nazi, but I
really don't want my baby daughter exposed to a know carcinogen.  That
also brings up the problem of my mother-in-law smoking.  It's her
house, and I don't feel comfortable asking her to stop smoking, but I
also don't want Del to have to breath it in.  I'm not sure what I'm
going to do.  Hopefully Amy will have some ideas, or won't care, and
I'll take my cues from her.)</p>

<p>So yeah, I'll be without the internet for all next week.  That'll
be a bit of a change.  I can't imagine what I'll do.  Fortunately,
we'll be taking the laptop, so I might get the chance to write some
code on a new Palm program that I've been thinking of.  With any luck,
I'll still be able to blog while I'm out there.  Or, at least, store
up the blogs on my Palm for posting when I get back.  We'll see how
well it works.  And I think I'll stop there, because Columbine joined
chat, and he's usually interesting.</p>

    <p>So.  I don't really have an excuse this time.  Nothing much has been
going on.  Well, nothing other than the usual stuff.  I did replace the
server, since it was starting to show its age, and it's taken me a little
longer than I thought it might to get everything back up and running.  I
have also been spending my time setting up secure IMAP so that I can check
my home email from both home and work, and not miss stuff when I'm on one
computer or the other.  Really, I'm not even sure why I'm writing, other
than to get back in the habit.  I'm reading a lot of <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/comments/tech/dynamic_polling_freq_too">
weblogs</a>, and even commenting in some of them.  I suppose that's the
real reason I'm writing this.  To give the backlinks somewhere to point

    <p>Well, I've been out of the loop for a while.  In my defense, my
wife had <a href="http://baby.latte.ca/">our first baby</a>, and I
took a month off to help her.  You might think that I would have a lot
of free time to update this poor weblog, but that's really not the way
babies work.  Even though taking care of a baby only takes a couple of
hours per day, it's broken up into 5-minute blocks, occurring right in
the middle of any task you wanted to try and perform, <a href="http://baby.latte.ca/pics/2003/0512/03-w-burping.jpg"><img src="http://baby.latte.ca/pics/2003/0512/03-t-burping.jpg" align="right"></a> and so you end up only being able to do one or two
things (if you're lucky!) all day.  So I didn't get to work on the
couple of programming projects I've been thinking about, and the house
fell into a minor state of disrepair, and basically Amy and I didn't
do much other than sit around and watch some <i>Sex And The City</i>
dvds we borrowed from a friend.  Well, we tried to get out of the
house at least once a day, so that we didn't go stir-crazy.</p>

<p>In other news, I biked to work today.  It went pretty well.  If you
get a copy of the <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/cycling/pdf/map6.pdf">Toronto Cycling
Map</a>, you can follow my path from Mount Pleasant Cemetery, down
through Moore Park Ravine, pas the Don Valley Brick Works, out and
down to Castle Frank station (I took a wrong turn on Elm), over to
Sherbourne street, and down Sherbourne to King Street (on the <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/cycling/pdf/map10.pdf">next map</a>), and
finally along King to the big number 37.  It was a fairly nice ride,
but I think that the next time I try it, I'm going to stick to the
roads all the way down.  The trail through the ravine was steep and
muddy in parts.  I had to walk halfway up a hill to get out of the
ravine, and I think I swallowed a bug.  It was nice and shady, but I
think that as long as I can get going at a reasonable speed, the wind
will cool me off just as well.</p>

<p>Update: I took the streets going back home, and it took 2/3 the
time despite being mainly uphill.  (I went up Sherbourne, along Glen,
over Summerhill to Welland and then back through the cemetary.  The
route is composed entirely of bike lanes and side streets, and after I
got north of Bloor, I think I only saw about 8 cars in total.  Well,
until I got to Moore.  Crossing Moore was a bit of an adventure, due
to the volume of cars coming from the other direction.)  All in all,
it was a really fun ride, and I think that will be the route I take
when I next bike to work.</p>

    <p>Well, I meant to write something about turning 30 here last week,
when I had the whole week off, but somehow I didn't have the time.  In
my defense, I watched many movies, read four books, and went to the
zoo, so it isn't as if I was sitting around doing nothing.  I did get
some truly excellent presents from Amy.  Underwear, books, and a NetMD
(<a href="http://makeashorterlink.com/?B258129C3">this one</a>), which
I've been listening to almost constantly, making various mixes of full
albums (Norah Jones, and NWA), random songs (Blue Man Group), and even
some BBC Radio Plays (The His Dark Materials series, which spans two
minidiscs at the highest compression!  7½ hours of radio play,
taken from RealAudio, through MP3 to ATRAC3-LP4).  Other than the new
stuff, 30 seems awfully similar to 29, which I'm sure comes as no big
surprise to anyone.  Um, and that's all about 30.</p>

On to equally interesting news.  I worked out again today, pushing
the weights up a little from where I had them last week just to see
how more weight would feel.  Not so bad, so I think I'm going to use
the new settings next time.  After I worked out, I had a blood
pressure of 127 over 85, which continues to be just fine, although
we'll see what the ham I'm having for dinner will do to it.  And
tomorrow I (hopefully) play some squash with Andy Cain, which will be
a nice aerobic workout to go with the anaerobic stuff I did this
evening.

    Yesterday Amy and I took a full-day course in <i>Child and Infant
CPR</i> from St. John Ambulance. <a href="http://www.sja.ca/"><img src="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/weblog/StJohnAmbulance.png" align="right"></a>  It was pretty interesting, and
covered a wide range of topics, since they had to cover the core First
Aid topics as well as the more small-person-specific stuff.  It seemed
to boil down to a couple of simple steps to follow for pretty much any
sort of emergency.  First, make sure it's safe.  Second, send someone
for medical help (911).  Third, make sure they're breathing.  Fourth,
make sure they're not bleeding.  The instructor had a lot of good
stories, and seemed to know her stuff fairly well, which made it
easier to learn from her, I think.  And I am very glad that I learned
the stuff, even though I hope I'll never have to use it.

    Well, the doctor took my blood pressure, and it's gone down to
140/85, which is within the normal range, so I won't have to take
any medication.  Woo.  The thing that I'm the most glad about,
strangely enough is that I can affect my health by the things I
do.  It's nice to know that something as simple as working out a
little, and not putting salt in the water when I boil pasta means
that I don't have to take a pill.  Of course, it's also kind of
annoying, since now I feel that much more responsible for my
health.  Oh well, two sides to every coin, I suppose.

    I'm going to the doctor tomorrow.  The last time I was there, she
told me that my blood pressure was too high, and that she wanted
to put me on medication for the rest of my life.  (Of course,
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/"><img src="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/weblog/LatteHeart.png" align="right"></a> she didn't phrase it quite that way, but I like to
think I've got a certain gift for re-interpretation.)  I
convinced her that I have the willpower to change my lifestyle,
and she agreed that I could try that for a few months and see if
it made a difference.  Well, my lifestyle has changed. I now get
out to the gym three or four days a week, and my salt intake has
dropped from its previous high level to something quite low, but
I'm not sure if my blood pressure has gone down any.  (I took it
after my last round of exercising and it was 128/92, which is
just over the high end of normal) It doesn't make things any
better that I'm starting to stress about the appointment
tomorrow, which is sure to drive it up.  Well, I guess the only
thing to do is go and get it done tomorrow, and live with the
consequences.  I guess my biggest concern now is whether I'll
continue to live this new, healthier lifestyle if it's not making
any difference to my health.

which means that I might be back on client development.  But not
quite yet, since there is a bunch of framework-ish stuff that I
can do before that.  A couple of new games, with the necessary
changes to the base stuff to support them in as simple a way as
possible.  But before any of that, I get to make our demo project
compile.  That was a bigger pain than I thought it would be,
since we renamed it from "PhantomGaming" to "PgCasino",
necessating wide-sweeping changes in many source files, as well
as different settings in the project files.  But it compiles now,
so in theory, on Monday, I can start implementing the new games.
Should be fun.

    So, I've just added the capability to update the weblog over the web.
Should be a nice feature for those sad days when the SSH daemon dies
unexpectedly.  And it works fairly well too.  I wonder how well it
deals with updates?  Oh, and I should also make it output the text in
a nicer format, but that's all stuff for later.  I've also got the
XML-RPC interface working, so I can use desktop tools from work to
post and modify entries.
