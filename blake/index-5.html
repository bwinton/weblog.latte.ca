    <p>So my role at the company is changing slightly.  Due to a manpower
shortage, I'll be back doing some server development.  Fortunately, I
sort of know my way around the modules this time, and so I don't
expect many surprises to crop up.  So, to make my life both simpler
and more difficult at the same time, I've decided to try out a new
IDE.  That's right, instead of using IDEA, I'll be giving Eclipse a
trial run.  It hasn't been too bad so far, but I'm still kind of
getting it set up to do the things I need it to.</p>

<p>My three main motivations for using Eclipse on this project are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>I need to look at C++ code at the same time as Java code, since
      that's the only documentation we have for this project.</li>
  <li>The savings of an IDEA license are not inconsiderable.</li>
  <li>The co-worker who is working on it with me prefers Eclipse</li>
</ol>
Are they great reasons to switch?  Maybe, maybe not, but they're good
enough reasons to give it a try for a while.  It helps that I have
been using an older version of Eclipse for my Python development, so
I'm a little familiar with it.

    <p>Yup, it's raining, and I'm commuting.  And so what happens?  I
bail.  This time I was changing lanes on Queen Street from the center
lane, across the streetcar tracks, into the outside lane in
preparation for turning right.  Now, on a dry day I can take those
streetcar tracks at about a 10° angle, but with the metal and
pavement being all wet, I guess I needed to be crossing it a little
more sharply.  Anyways, down I went.  I have a couple of slight
abrasions on my elbow and knee, but neither of them hurt as much as
wiping it down with the first-aid pad.  And it's another lesson
learned, making two.
<b><ol>
<li>Don't use your front brake in the rain.</li>
<li>Don't cross streetcar tracks sideways, especially in the rain.</li>
</ol></b>
At this rate, I'll have enough lessons to write a book by the time I'm 80.</p>

    <p>As you may remember, I <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake/random/biking/Ouch.html">fell off
my bike</a> a few weeks ago.  Well, ever since then, my shoulder has
been hurting if I tried to raise it horizontally with my palm up.
This morning, I went to my wife's chiropracter to see if she could
tell me why, and what was up with it.  After moving my arm in a bunch
of ways, she determined that I did something with my rotator cuff, and
so I'm going to see her again on Thursday, and she gave me a strange
exercise to do in the meantime.  I'm not exactly sure how the <a href="http://patients.uptodate.com/topic.asp?file=bone_joi/8115">pendulum
stretching exercise</a> will help, but that's the second reference
I've found to it, so I guess it does something.  (She suggested I do
it without the weight, though.  Actually, she didn't mention a weight
at all, but I think my arm is probably heavy enough to have some
benefit as it is.)  Similarly, the muscles on the knee that I came
down on are far tighter than the ones on the other side, so I suspect
we'll be working on that as well in the coming visits.</p>

<p>I'll have to remember to ask her on Thursday how long she thinks it
will take to heal up.  Here's hoping it gets better sooner (like the
"2-4 weeks minimum" listed on the previous webpage), instead of later
(like the "never" listed on the previous webpage).</p>

    <p>On my ride home yesterday, it started to rain.  I haven't ridden in
the rain much, so I figured I'ld do a test stop, to see how much
longer it would take me to come to a complete halt.  I waited until I
was on an empty street, fairly close to my home, and peddled until I
got to 32km/h (I usually get to 35km/h on that stretch of street, <a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/weblog/Hurt%20And%20Baba/large/Knee.jpg"><img align="right" src="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/weblog/Hurt%20And%20Baba/Knee.jpg"></a>
but I didn't want to push it).  It turns out that at that speed, it
takes me approximately twice as long, which is good to know.<a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/weblog/Hurt%20And%20Baba/large/Elbow.jpg"><img align="left" src="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/weblog/Hurt%20And%20Baba/Elbow.jpg"></a>
I figured I would take it a little slower for the rest of the ride
home.  I made a left, then a right, and then, as I was slowing down
nice and gently, and making the next right, my front wheel hit a patch
of water, and locked up.  The bike turned, and I completely bailed
onto the street, landing on my knee, and then my elbow.  It was kind
of fun sliding down the pavement on a layer of water.  Sort of like a
Slip-N-Slide.  I picked myself up, used the rest of the water in my
bottle to rinse off the worst of the gravel, and biked home, where Amy
scrubbed the injuries with a washcloth, and put some Polysporin on
them to heal.  They're already looking a lot better, and they don't
hurt much, so I'm hoping for a swift recovery, with minimal scarring.

    <p>On Sunday, Amy, Delphine, and I went to meet some friends from New
York at the Distillery District.  Sadly, we just missed the bus at
King and Yonge which would have taken us there, which got me to
thinking.  Normally I'm an extremely punctual person.  In fact, I
usually show up five or ten minutes early to wherever it is I'm
supposed to be, with the expectation that I'll have to entertain
myself.  Since my Clie is with me all the time, and I usually have two
or three books on the go on it, I'm never worried about having
something to do while I wait.  (The one exception to this is hanging
around Delphine's day care.  I feel sort of like the strange man who's
a little too interested in your children.  Since I'll probably be
picking up Del for the next few months so that Amy can work a few more
hours, I should probably get over that, eh?)  Anyways, when I'm
travelling with Delphine, I'm much less likely to get somewhere early,
because she's much harder to keep amused for five or ten minutes than
I am, and so I cut my travelling time closer, and then sometimes miss
connections.</p>

<p>Just something to keep in mind if you're ever meeting me
somewhere.</p>
