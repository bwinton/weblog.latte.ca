    <p>Okay, y'all know by now that we've got a new Mac.  And in the grand
tradition of new computers, I'm trying to burn up all the hard drive
space with fun or useful utilities.  Since this is pretty much my
first exposure to OSX, anything goes, since I probably haven't heard
of it.</p>

<p>Having said that, here's what I have found:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">QuickSilver</a></li>
<li>I installed <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a>, but I don't
think anything is using it, other than <a href="http://transmission.m0k.org/">Transmission</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a>
(Freeware, from the people who make <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml">BBEdit</a>)
is surprisingly my editor of choice.  (Well, except for this post.)  I
was sure I'ld stick with vim, being old-skool like that, but I find I
want to save my Terminal window for running things, and edit my source
in an editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and the two neat new tricks I've learned so far are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Command-Shift-4, then the spacebar to take a screenshot of
just one window, and</li>
<li>
<pre>sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowText -string "My Funny Message!!!"</pre>
to print a message on the login window.</li>

    <p>In a <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/09/05/What-Ruby-Needs">recent weblog entry</a>, Tim Bray wrote about some things he thought
Ruby lacked.  Since he doesn't have comments enabled, I thought I
would share my opinions here, as a series of disjointed thoughts.</p>

<p>He said "Ruby needs an IDE.  All programming languages need IDEs."
Well, I completely agree with that, and for my serious Python
programming (as opposed to noodling around in Python), I tend to use
Eclipse, because it's there.  Perhaps Ruby could take the same
approach...</p>

<p>Of course, he also said a couple of things where I think he's a
little off the mark.  For instance "I should never have to scroll
much; IDEs go to a lot of trouble to make it trivial to jump from
wherever to the source for the method being called, or its docs, or
the next compile error or breakpoint, or variable declaration, or
whatever. Scrolling back and forth in a source-code file is just
stupid."  This I see more as a problem with his choice of editor, or
perhaps his knowledge of its features.  I'm fairly sure both emacs and
vi allow you to jump to the things he's asking for...</p>

<p>"certain aspects of Unicode are, on the surface at least,
objectively racist; for example, why does UTF-8 encoding of characters
become progressively less efficient as you move from the languages of
the Western hemisphere to those of the East?"  Hmm...  I don't know...
My first guess would be because Western languages have approximately a
10,000th the number of characters as Eastern languages.  My second
guess would have something to do with Huffman coding and the
prevalence of Western Language (mainly English) documents on the net,
but I do recognize that this could be due to my only being able to
read English.</p>

<p>As for Integration, isn't that what Parrot, .NET, and the JVM are
supposed to provide us?  If I'm wrong, and the language level is the
appropriate level to solve this problem, then I sincerely hope that
it's the Ruby and Python communities who get together to do
something.</p>

<p>And finally, he missed what I consider to be the most important
part of an IDE.  (No, not Source Control Integration!)  An integrated
debugger.  I had to go back to print statements to figure out what was
happening in Demokritos recently, and it just sucked.  So I added in
some pdb support, and while it was easy to add the breakpoints, using
it also sucked.  Can we please show me the list of variables in a box
at the top of my screen, and more than zero lines of context around
the currently executing line?  Please?  It was so bad that I'm
actually going to install Eclipse on my Mac Mini, just to avoid it in
the future.</p>

    <p>Cc:-ed to the MacPython list, because they might know.</p>
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I'm trying to get Subversion bindings for my installed version of
MacPython (/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/)  This
seems to mean that I want to install Subversion, and if so, I would
like to get it hooked up to Apache so that I can connect to
http://svn.latte.ca/ (or whatever) on my work computer and access my
home repository.</p>

<p>Now, I can install the subversion python bindings using
DarwinPorts, but that won't hook into the Framework version of Python,
so I've downloaded the Subversion 1.3.2 sources, and I can build them,
but they complain about my version of Apache.  Specifically, about
apxs being too old.</p>

<p>Do I really need to upgrade apache to Apache 2 to get this all
working?</p>

<p>Is there a good way of replacing the default Apache with Apache 2,
or is that a really bad idea because the Software Update will get
horribly confused?</p>

<p>Is there another place I should be asking these questions?</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>
Blake.</p>

<p>As I <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/firstpost.html">mentioned
before</a>, we got a Mac Mini.  It's been a bit of a pain getting it all
set up, but I think we're finally done.  The web server is moved over,
along with all the websites.  The mail server is moved over, and I took
the opportunity to delete my mother's account.  (That's not as bad as it
sounds.  She had it redirecting to GMail anyways, and the error message
says as much.  Of course, since I haven't told her about it yet, this
will probably come as a bit of a surprise.)  Uh, and that turned out to
be all the servers I was running.  Well, I was running CherryPy, and
some other stuff, but it wasn't particularly important, and I've found
better ways of doing it, for the most part.</p>
<p>But that's not really why I'm posting here.  I'm posting here because
I got some cool Python stuff working under the Mac, and I wanted to
share it.  Specifically, I (or rather, my wife and I) wanted to have a
window showing on the login screen, displaying <a href="http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/city/pages/on-143_metric_e.html">the
weather</a>.  After several bits of trial and error, and liberal
"borrowing" from <a href="http://livingcode.org/">Dethe Elza</a>'s <a href="http://livingcode.org/project/pastels/">Pastels project</a> I
finally got something which would do what I wanted.  First, the code:</p>

<p>Based on my experiences with tricky detours heading up to Balm
Beach, I thought that I should just take nice straight routes home,
and see how that worked out.  So I took Highway 6/27 straight into
Barrie, then Concession Road 10 to Bradford, then Yonge Street stright
to Finch Station.</p>

<p>As I said in the previous post, there was some craziness on the
trip back.  The weather prediction was a 40% chance of thunderstorms.
I figure those are better odds than you would get at a casino, and I
don't really have any other way to get home, so it didn't really
affect my planning.  I got to Barrie in record time, and figured that
if the rest of the trip was that easy, I would have nothing to worry
about.  After an Iced Capp at Timmy's I made my way onto Concession
Road 10, and kept on keeping on.  Sure enough, 20 minutes out of
Barrie, the skies opened, and a torrential downpour started.  For most
of it I was reduced to peering out of one mostly-closed eye, seeing
only a few tens of feet ahead of me, since the rain was apparently
pelting its way <i>through</i> my sunglasses, to hit me in the eyes.
I suppose, in retrospect, that that was a good clue to me that I
should have pulled over to the side of the road, and waited it out,
but at the time, I figured I should just keep on riding, over to the
edge more so that cars wouldn't hit me, because who knows how long the
rain would last, and I didn't want to be stuck standing there for
hours.  Well, the rain didn't last that long, but it did manage to
completely soak me, and my shoes didn't dry out that night, nor the
next.  Having said that, the wet shirt and shorts did manage to keep
me comfortably cool for the rest of the ride.</p>

<p>South of Barrie, I stopped in Bradford for a rest, gave Amy a call,
and went on South down Yonge.  It was getting a little hillier, and so
I tried to take it a little easier, stopping every now and then.  I
met a nice kid who was taking the bus to his job at Canada's
Wonderland.  He was hoping for a thunderstorm, so that he could sit
around and do nothing, and still get paid.  Heh.  He was also quite
impressed at my trip so far.  Finally, I saw the CN Tower.  What a
rush that was.  I worked out at one point that I could describe my
trip as "Go as far north as you can see.  Then look north again, and
go as far north as you can see.  Lather.  Rinse.  Repeat."  I never
did manage to keep track of how many times you would have to do that,
but it's sort of a neat idea.  Maybe next year.</p>

<p>It would have been a lot shorter if I hadn't made three wrong
turns.  The first was missing the short turn South from Holland
Landing Road onto Bridge Street, and instead going up Bathurst to the
"No Exit" sign.  (I'm very glad I decided to stop when I saw that
sign, since the road got quite a bit worse after that.)  The map I'm
using makes it look like you can just continue along the Holland
Landing Road, and it will turn into the Bridge Street, but you really
do need to jog South.</p>

<p>The second was trying to take the North Simcoe Rail Trail, which
turned out to be much like the Belt Line or the Don Valley Trail, in
that it was unpaved gravel, but worse, in that it was overgrown by
flowers, bushes, and grasses.  It also turned out to not be a
continuous trail, and at one point (between Golf Course Road and
Hendrie Road) I came across an electrified fence, beyond which were
six or seven cows.  Now, there were warnings that some sections of the
trail ran through private property, and because we're not in England,
where there are Right Of Way laws which force people to let travellers
through, some of the owners have decided to disallow access through
their sections.  I'm fine with that.  Of course, since there was no
way around, I had to backtrack to the last road.  The thing that irks
me is that there was no indication that that section of trail was a
dead end, so instead of just cutting around it, I had to waste my time
finding out for myself.  Between that, and the slow pace I had to take
while riding through the weeds, and the many road crossings, which
slowed me down even further, I resolved to stick to paved roads for
the rest of the trip.</p>

<p>The third was the longest inadvertent detour, and most
disheartening of all.  When I was heading out of Elmvale, I thought I
was on Highway 6, which would take me straight to Balm Beach Road, but
I was actually on Highway 27, which, if you don't take the Highway 6
exit, turns to the right, and heads off to Waverley after going up a
huge hill.  A nice couple asked me if I knew where I was, and I had
them convinced for a second that we were all in Wyevale, because how
could I be <i>that</i> far off course?  But no, I was, indeed, that
far off course, and had to backtrack to Highway 6 to continue my
journey.</p>

<p>Between the extra mileage from the wrong turns, and the extra
mileage from trying to avoid hills and traffic by heading up Leslie
instead of up Yonge, and by trying to take the North Simcoe Rail Trail
and the Tiny Trail, I ended up biking 172 km on the way there, making
that my first Imperial Century (107 miles).  (And I'm not just saying
that so that I can have ridden more than <a href="http://crazybikerchick.blogspot.com/2006/07/my-first-century.html">Tanya</a>.)  For comparison, on the way back, starting and ending at
the same points, I only went 131 km (81 miles).</p>

to Balm Beach on my bicycle.  Well, the date has been set, and it's
this coming Saturday.  I've done a couple of successively longer rides
after the 87km Musselman Lake ride, a 103km ride out to Holland
Landing and back, and a 126km ride up to Keswick and back.  I've
planned out a route (see right), and think it should be a long, but
do-able ride.  It's a little bit longer than my longest ride (which
was yesterday, up to Keswick and back), but I'm going to start earlier
(8:00am from Steeles, instead of 9:00am from Finch), and I don't mind
finishing later.  (I finished the Keswick ride, including taking the
subway home from Finch, at 5:30pm, but these days, it's light out
until almost 9:00pm.  I don't really want to be biking for 13 hours
continuously, but it's good to know that the option is there, if I
decide to stop for a really long lunch, or something.)</p>

noticed the difference so far, but it's a fairly short ride from <a href="http://www.ucycle.com">the bike shop</a> to <a href="http://www.phantomfiber.com/location_contact.php">my office</a>,
and along the way, I was carrying my old tires.  I'm hoping that I'll
notice more of a difference on my ride home.</p>

<p>But that's not really why I'm posting this.  (I'm also not posting
this in an attempt to drown out Amy's talk of cute children and
chcoclate cake.)  I'm posting this because just this morning, I
changed my tires for the first time in my life!  It's true, I've never
had a flat before, and I was a little nervous about getting one one my
big trip, but now that I've changed both the front and the back wheel,
I see how easy it really is, and it's no longer a concern for me.
(The instructions I heard from a guy at <a href="http://www.mec.ca/">MEC</a> last Bike Week really helped, and it's really just not that
hard, although I expect it's a little trickier when it's pouring
rain.)</p>

<p>In other news, does anyone know of a good bike route from <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.09024,-95.712891&amp;sspn=0.953042,1.7276&amp;saddr=7+Tiny+Beaches+Rd+N,+ON+L0L+1B0,+Canada+(Georgian+Grill)+%4044.693924,-79.998813&amp;daddr=1901+Yonge+Street,+Toronto&amp;om=1">Balm Beach to Toronto</a>?</p>

was chatting with both <a href="http://www.tantastik.org/">Tan</a> and
<a href="http://book.amberdragon.ca/">Kate</a> recently, and they each
mentioned how much Delphine looked like me.  I completely agree, and
have the photo to prove it.</p>

<p>No, that's not actually my sister and my daughter.  That's my
mother and I, circa 1976(-ish.  I'm guessing that I was three in the
photo).<br clear="both"></p>
