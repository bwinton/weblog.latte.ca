    <p>Just because that would be too easy by itself, I'm going to follow
<a href="http://www.third-bit.com/drproject/drproject-dev/wiki/DrProjectOnCygwin">the instructions for Cygwin</a>, and we'll see what happens.</p>

<p>Okay, it's going fairly well so far...<br>
And then I get to step 3:<br></p>
<pre>Download, compile, and install sqlite from sources. Use version 3.3.5.</pre>
To compile it, I use "./configure", "make",
"make install", but that gives me the following error:
<pre><code>$ make install
tclsh ./tclinstaller.tcl 3.3
can't read "env(DESTDIR)": no such variable
    while executing
"set LIBDIR $env(DESTDIR)[lindex $auto_path 0]"
    (file "./tclinstaller.tcl" line 10)
make: *** [tcl_install] Error 1</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki/wiki?p=HowToCompile">This
page</a> tells me to remove each occurance of "$(DESTDIR)" from
Makefile, so I did, and it still didn't work, so I tried commenting out
"HAVE_TCL = 1" and then it all seemed to work just fine.</p>

<p>Until I got to the line:
</p>
<pre>chmod +x /lib/python2.4/site-packages/pysqlite-2.2.2-py2.4-cygwin-1.5.19-i686.egg/pysqlite2/_pysqlite.dll</pre>
which failed, but it was easy enough to change it to:
<pre>chmod +x /lib/python2.4/site-packages/pysqlite-2.2.2-py2.4-cygwin-1.5.19-i686.egg/pysqlite2/_sqlite.dll</pre>
which worked.


<p>Running
</p>
<pre>drproject-server --debug --port 8080 --auto-reload --create=/tmp/drproject</pre>
gave me the error:
<pre>drproject-server: error: --create option does not take a value</pre>

So I tried
<pre>drproject-server --debug --port 8080 --auto-reload --create</pre>
which said:
<pre>drproject-server: error: incorrect number of arguments</pre>

So I finally tried
<pre>drproject-server --debug --port 8080 --auto-reload --create /tmp/drproject</pre>
and it seemed good.

<p>Finally, I ran
</p>
<pre>drproject-server --debug --port 8080 --auto-reload /tmp/drproject</pre>
And it was good...

<p>So I created a script called "drproject-server-profile", to profile
it, containing the following lines
</p>
<pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/python
# EASY-INSTALL-ENTRY-SCRIPT: 'DrProject==1.0dev-r2084','console_scripts','drproject-server'
__requires__ = 'DrProject==1.0dev-r2084'
import sys
from pkg_resources import load_entry_point

import profile
profile.run("sys.exit(load_entry_point('DrProject==1.0dev-r2084', 'console_scripts', 'drproject-server')())", 'profile.tmp')</code></pre>
and <a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/profile.tmp">here</a> is the data!

    <p>I took a few notes at <a href="http://barcamp.org/TorCampDemoCamp5">DemoCamp 5</a> last night, and thought I'ld throw them up on the
web, in case anyone found them useful.</p>

<p>First, some notes on giving a good demo.<br>
In no particular order:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Set your screensaver's timeout to something long, so that you
    aren't continually hitting the spacebar/moving the mouse.</li>
  <li>Repeat the questions, so that people in the back can hear what
    was being asked.</li>
  <li>Log on before connecting the video.  I forget why, other than it
    looked a little more professional, perhaps.  Maybe someone forgot
    their password, or mistyped their username.</li>
  <li>Have someone type for you, so that you can concentrate on what
    you're saying, instead of trying to come up with fake data.</li>
  <li>When the demo's run out of time, don't try to fit in just one
    more thing...  Unless you have someone who can continue typing
    while you're answering questions.  ;)</li>
</ul>
<p>The next thing that struck me as sort of odd was that all the
presentations were web-based.  Isn't anyone working on a regular
desktop program anymore?</p>

<p>Finally, I also had some specific comments for <a href="http://blogmatrix.blogmatrix.com/">BlogMatrix</a>, which I
posted as a <a href="http://davidjanes.com/cgi-bin/xyx999.cgi?entry_id=3619">comment</a> on <a href="http://blog.davidjanes.com/">David Janes'
blog</a>.  (I've chatted with David over email a while ago, so I was
paying particular attention to his demo.)</p>

<p>In other DemoCamp news, I got a <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/000467.html">shout-out</a> from <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/">Greg Wilson</a>, which was very
gratifying, but I'm afraid I might have given him slightly the wrong
impression.  I suppose I do think that educators have a responsiblity
to prepare students for the real world, but I don't think that it's
the University-level educators who have that responsibility.  I think
that programming (by which I really mean logical thinking, but
programming is one of the best ways I know of to teach it, since the
results are very clearly right or wrong) should be one of the
mandatory courses in high school.  By the time you get to University,
you should be learning stuff like Lisp/Scheme, or ML, or concurrency,
or finite state machines.  Stuff that won't help you get a job, but
will hopefully help you do your job better, if only by expanding your
mind, and giving you new approaches to solving problems, or new
insights into what might be causing the problems in the first place.
I think that Institutions of Higher Learning should be about Higher
Learning, and leave the more vocational stuff to vocational schools.
This is somewhat ironic, since I went to Waterloo for the co-op
experience, one of the most vocational schools and programs out
there.</p>

<p>It could be that I'm looking at this all wrong, and that
universities are there to prepare you for a job, and then, once you're
out in the Real World, you go to places like <a href="http://web.engcorp.com/pygta">PyGTA</a>, or DemoCamp, or even
just watch <a href="http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/">some videos</a> and join <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lispme">a mailing list</a> about
Scheme to do your real learning.  Or maybe I just didn't follow the
academic path far enough.  When I left, I was <i>really</i> glad to
get the hell out of there, but now that I've been in the workforce for
a few years...  Wait, 7 years?  How did that happen?  Anyways, now
that I've been in the workforce, I'm thinking that I would like to go
back and try to get my Masters, or even my PhD in Computer Science.
At U of T, this time, since I far prefer living in Toronto to living
in Waterloo.</p>

    <p>As I <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake/random/biking/SoTired.html">mentioned
previously</a>, I'm going to head up to Balm Beach sometime in late
July.  This sort of worried me, since up until now, all my biking was
commuting (8 km one way, 12 km the other), or going on slightly longer
group rides (21 km, but only 13.6 km/h).  None of these tiny rides
would prepare me for a 135 km trek up to Balm Beach.</p>

<p>So I decided to go on one of the <a href="http://www.bikerally.org">PWA Bike Rally</a> training rides.  Specifically, the one this
morning, heading up to <a href="http://www.bikerally.org/trainingmaps2006/87k_KennedyMusselman.pdf">Musselman Lake</a>.  It ended up being almost 94 km for me, instead
of the 87 km they claim it will be, but I figure most of that is my
walking my bike onto and off of the TTC.  Even counting those slow
kilometers, though, I still managed to average 23.2 km/h, which is
really quite respectible, I feel, for my first time out.  And yeah, it
totally wasn't a problem.  I mean, I'm quite tired now, but I'm still
up and walking around, and I think I could even have biked home, if I
had to.  Much easier to pay my $2.10 to the TTC, and let them carry
me, though.</p>

<p>What else...  I met a bunch of really friendly people, and rode in
a group of two or three most of the way there and most of the way
back.  I've heard that it's quite different to ride alone, and I
expect I'll get the chance to find out (unless someone wants to ride
up north with me...  ;)  Oh, yeah, and it took me five hours of wall
time to ride the 94 km, but only 4 hours of riding time.  I wonder why
the huge difference, since I didn't stop for an hour at the
midpoint.  Ah well, one of cyclings unexplained mysteries, I presume.</p>

    <p>Well, that was kind of fun, but the TTC strike, instead of being
the huge boon that I had hoped it would be, turned out to result in
millions of cars backing their way up Yonge Street, almost all the way
to Lawrence.  Since we were all in a group, we couldn't (or didn't
want to) filter past them on the right, so instead of half an hour, it
ended up taking us 45 minutes to get from Lawrence to Bloor, by which
point all the other commuters had left.  By the time we got to the
pancake breakfast, the line was far too long for me, and so I just
went straight to work.  (I should probably mention that this happened
to me last time, and so I had already packed a container of Cheerios
and powdered milk which I ate when I got to the office.)</p>

<p>An idea for next time might be to head down one of the side
streets, maybe even one with a bike lane?  That way it would both be a
faster ride, and would show people how they might get down to work on
their bikes when they didn't have police blocking traffic for them.
(I wouldn't commute down Yonge street every day, so it's not really a
great introduction to bike commuting in the city.)</p>

<p>Apart from those minor problems, it was good to meet <a href="http://bikerefugee.blogspot.com/">Darren</a>, who had twice as
many people show up for his unofficial commute as I did, (two,
counting himself, as opposed to one, counting myself, ;) and I got
interviewed for a video of some sort.  I'm afraid I didn't come off
that well.  I seemed to be repeating myself, and stammering a lot, but
I hope whomever it was got some useful footage out of me.</p>

want to be part of the Bike Week Group Commute.  So in a similar vein,
I'ld love to be part of a Pre-Group Commute from Yonge and Davisville
up to Yonge and Lawrence.  I plan on leaving at about 7:00 to make it
an easy ride to Yonge and Lawrence by 7:30.  The route will be over to
Duplex, and then up to Roehampton (just North of Eglinton), and then
up Yonge to Lawrence.</p>

<p>I'll be wearing an orange jacket and a golden helmet, and the back
of my bike will have a black pannier. Hope to see you there!</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> If this <a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/weblog/on-143_metric_e.html">weather</a>
holds up, I'll skip the orange jacket and just go with a black "<a href="http://www.goldenpalacemobile.com/">GoldenPalace.com</a>"

    <p>When I listened to the first song, they sounded like a band I listened
to back in university.  Something like a cross between Sloan and Live,
or The Lowest of the Low.  Live, maybe?  It wasn't any of those but
that was the sort of genre it reminds me of...</p>

<p>I guess what I'm trying to say there is that as far as I can tell,
it's classic Indie Rock, circa 1994, and god help me, I love it.  I'm
sure the muscial landscape has changed in the last 12, no, wait, 13
years, but it's good to see that there are still bands out there who
are playing the things I used to hear.  Damn, does that means that I'm
old, when I start liking songs like the ones I used to hear?  I'll
just chalk it up to nostalgia instead of age.  Shut up.</p>

<p>I should probably put in <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Forecast">a link</a> to more info,
shouldn't I?</p>

<p>Finally, I know I totally missed the 1500 character target, but
man, this reviewing thing is hard.  All the harder when I'm only
listening to music at the office, where I'm really trying to
concentrate on my job, instead of on the music.  The first few times I
listened to the album, I was halfway through the following album
before I realized that I should have been listening.</p>

    <p>Pretty sweet.  They were described to me as "slightly-harder drum
and bass", which worried me a little, since I didn't know if I would
be up for something heavy, but either it was only slightly-harder, or
I don't know how hard regular drum and bass is, or I ended up being in
a heavier mood than I thought I was, because I thoroughly enjoyed the
album.  It sort of drifted into the background, which is exactly what
I'm hoping for when I listen to music at work.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure what else to say here.  I suppose I could add
that they didn't seem as minimal as the Plastikman/FUSE albums I've
got, and they were a lot less sample-heavy than Mushroom Jazz by Mark
Farina, but I don't think that really tells you much about the music
itself.  Hopefully, with more exposure to some quality drum and bass,
I'll be able to give more informed opinions, but for now, I guess this
will have to be my baseline for future reviews.</p>

<p>Oh, one more thing, the next few reviews might run a little late,
because even though I've listened to the music, I only have a couple
of hundred words written about each of them, and I'm guessing that
it'll take some re-listening to think of more things to say.</p>

    <p>Since our <del>receptionist</del> (Oops, "Office Manager") left,
and I took the opportunity to grab a copy of her entire iTunes folder,
I've been listening to a lot of new music.  Most of it is even
actually new, and not just new to 33-year old fogeys who are stuck
back in 1992.  So, along with some book reviews that I'm in the middle
of writing, I figured that I would write some reviews of the new tunes
that I've been listening to, in the hopes that it will get me posting
a little more to this weblog thing.</p>

<p>I promise to not review more than one thing per day, so as to not
overwhelm the five of you who read this weblog.  Having said that,
I've been listening to more than one thing in the past couple of days,
so I've got a few things for review queued up, which means that we'll
probably have at least one per (week-)day for the next little while.
I'm aiming for approximately 200 words per review, or more accurately
somewhere near 1500 characters, because my editor (Scite) has a count
of characters, but no word-count that I could find.  Clearly this post
isn't going to make that limit, but then again, it's not actually a
review, so I don't mind.</p>

<p>And I've just realized that I lied.  I'll probably be doing some
book reviews as well, and perhaps even a review of a restaurant, if
one catches my fancy.  If I were younger, with more desposable income,
I'ld be all over the new gadget reviews, too.</p>
