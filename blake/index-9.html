    <p>And today it all fell apart.  Instead of pre-preparing dinner when
Delphine was at kindergarten, I read my book, and watched The Daily
Show.  As a result, the salmon casserole was nowhere near ready at
5:00, and indeed, wasn’t ready until about 6:30.  So Delphine had
chicken noodle soup, billion-grain toast (I’m serious, there’s no
flour in this freakin’ bread.  It’s all just seeds and nuts packed
together somehow!), and some cherry tomatoes which my parents brought
over last night (in exchange for the apple cake and apple pie and ice
cream).  And after we went out for fish &amp; chips for lunch, too.
Thank god for the tomatoes, or I’ld feel like a completely bad
parent.</p>

<p>And now I’m off to read some more (by which I of course mean watch
some more TV), before turning in for the night.</p>

    <p>Yeah, today is coming together much better than yesterday did.  I
just skipped the Starbucks, and came home from kindergarten, stopping
off at Valumart to pick up a couple of pie shells.  Oh, yeah, this
morning, Delphine and I made an apple cake, but our <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/sku3993557/index.cfm">bundt pan</a> wasn’t nearly large enough, so we were left with a ton
of apple filling.  I threw it into a (store-bought, shhh!) pie shell,
cut the other shell into strips, and made a nice lattice on top, and
I’m now baking it at 350º for 25 minutes.  (I totally guessed at the
time and temperature.  I suppose I should go look it up in Betty
Crocker, huh?  Damn, did I ever mess that one up!  Betty says 425º for
40-50 minutes, with foil around the edges and stuff.  Good thing I
checked.)  Easy-peasy (even with the foil).</p>

<p>Anyways, I think I’m going to end this entry now, and go sit on the
couch and read my book.  <span style="font-size:x-large">Mu</span><span style="font-size:large">hu</span><span style="font-size:medium">heheha</span><span style="font-size:small">hahaha</span><span style="font-size:x-small">haha</span><span style="font-size:xx-small">hahaaaaa</span>…</p>

    <p>Ah, kindergarten.  After dropping Delphine off, I went to
Starbucks, grabbed myself a latte, and sat and started to read my
book.  Sadly, the presence of two wasps flying past my head sort of
ruined my quite interlude, and I headed on home.  When I was here, I
managed to check my email, increment the laundry (you all use that
term too, right?  When you put the stuff from the dryer into the
basket, the stuff from the washer into the dryer, and stuff from the
dirty hamper into the washer), and hang the wet load out in the
backyard.  Yeah, apparently when Amy isn’t home I get all domestic.
Who’lda thunk it?</p>

<p>But even given that, I really seem to have less free time than I
thought I would.  Somehow, between checking email and the various
household chores, I haven’t been able to read as much of my book as I
would have wanted, much less write the specs/code that I was hoping
to.  Ah well, perhaps I’ll get used to the routine by Friday, or maybe
I’ll just put those tasks on pause until I get back to work.</p>

    <p>Today seemed a little more in control than yesterday.  I was really
slacking yesterday, doing as little housework as I could possibly
manage.  Today I got a load of laundry done, and hung up in the
basement, and I would be on my second load, but apparently the door
didn’t close, or something, and so the load was completely dry when I
went to check it after dinner.  Dinner was another thing I handled a
little better.  Since my father and sister were coming for dinner, I
made chili from around 3:00 until 4:00, and let it sit on the stove on
low, mellowing.  It turned out really well, I think, and there are some
leftovers.  Delphine and I also made some Rice Krispie Squares that
afternoon (I made them, she licked the various implements), so we had a
fun dessert as well.</p>

<p>I’m really looking forward to tomorrow, though, since I’ll have two
fairly large blocks of free time, in which to attempt to beat the house
into something approaching shape.  The kitchen really needs a cleaning,
there are three more loads of laundry to do.  (Four if you count the
failed attempt in the washing machine.)  In the morning, I’ve got to
make sure that Delphine has all the stuff she needs for kindergarten.
Okay, that’s not actually something I can do in the blocks of free time,
but I figured since I was listing all the stuff I need to get done, I
might as well just slip it in there.  And on that note, I think I’ll be
off to try and get another couple of things done before I head to
bed.</p>

    <p>Amy and Cordelia left for Saskatchewan at 6:30 this morning, and so
Delphine and I got to spend the whole day together.  The first of
seven.  It’s going pretty well so far, I think.  We played together in
the park this morning: digging in the sand, flying kites, and kicking
a soccer ball.  We got home, and had some leftovers for lunch (grilled
cheese and pizza, both heated in the toaster over), then watched the
obligatory Charlie and Lola show, and read some books.  Ooh, we also
had banana/frozen-strawberry/milk smoothies for afternoon snack.  They
were really good, and a convenient way to get some fruit into our
bodies.  After hanging out a little, we went to the grocery store,
grabbed the week’s worth of groceries, and headed home.  So I thought
I’ld take a few minutes to write a quick blog entry while I’m cooking
dinner (frozen President’s Choice vegetable lasagna).</p>

<p>Dinner was tasty, and Delpine liked it, even though she started off
saying “I’ve had this before at daycare, and I don’t like it.”.  Then
we looked for recipes for apple cake, found one, and headed off to
bed.  And now I’m not entirely sure what I’m going to do for the rest
of the evening.  I suppose there’s a FIFA Women’s World Cup game I’ve
got taped, or I could watch a video about Haskell by Simon
Peyton-Jones, but I dunno, neither of those seem to really be grabbing
me.  Ah well, I’m sure I’ll figure something out.</p>

    <p><a href="../images/blake/Karma.jpg"><img align="right" src="../images/blake/small/Karma.jpg"></a>As I was riding to work
today, just after crossing the railroad bridge, heading on to
Summerhill, I noticed a man poking at his bicycle.  I stopped, and
asked if he needed a hand, and sure enough, he did.  He seemed to have
gotten his chain wedged around his <a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_bo-z.html#bottom">Bottom
bracket</a>, in such a way that the arms of the <a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_sp-ss.html#spider">Spider</a>
were attempting to push the top and bottom pieces of the chain
<i>through</i> the <a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ch.html#chainstay">chainstay</a>.  That obviously wasn’t working, so I grabbed my
multitool, and attempted to use the largest <a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_aa-l.html#allen">Allen key</a>
to try to lever it out.  When that too failed, I pulled out the one
tool in my collection I’ve never used: The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_tool">Chain Tool</a>.  After
a few tries, I eventually got the chain apart, after which it was an
not-so-easy matter of threading it out through the gap between the
spider and the chainstay, re-threading it onto the <a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ch.html#chainring">chainring</a>,
and re-connecting it.  As a final gesture of goodwill/parting gift, I
gave him my last 2007 <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/cycling/map/index.htm">Bike Map</a>.
(Yeah, I know the link is to the 2006 page.  They really have to
update that sometime...)  After all that, I got to the office 15
minutes late.  (Well, 15 minutes later.  I didn’t have a meeting or
anything, and our core hours don’t start until 10:00.)  But I’ve got
to say, that was 15 minutes well spent, since it made the rest of my
ride in seem extra-pleasant.<br clear="both"></p>

    <p>I’ve recently started using <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">bzr</a> as my go-to version control
system, and as a newbie I’ve <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/bzr/BazaarNotes1.html">run
into a couple of small things</a> I’ld like changed.  Fortunately, bzr
is written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, and comes
with an extensive set of unit tests, so it was easy for me to jump
right in and add the feature I wanted.  To be honest, I started off by
writing it up as <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr/+bug/129299">a bug report</a>,
with a trivial patch (by which I mean one without any tests).  The
comments on the bug led me to write up an actual mergable set of
changes (which seems to be called a bundle by the bzr folks), and
submit it for review.  What followed was a few <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.bazaar-ng.general/29306/focus=29306">back-and-forths</a> where various people pointed out things I hadn’t
done correctly, or hadn’t really understood, and I fixed them.  As a
result, I think the code in <a href="http://bundlebuggy.aaronbentley.com/request/%3C46C303B4.60109%40latte.ca%3E">the most recent bundle</a> is pretty good, and is certainly far
better than anything I would have produced on my own.</p>

    <p>Ah, the city.  How I love it.  I’ve just gotten back from a trip to
the cottage my parents’ rented, and while the house is sort of lonely
with just me there, I’m really enjoying being able to flush the
toilet, and have a long shower, and run the air conditioning, and all
those other conveniences of modern life.  That’s not to say that I
didn’t enjoy the cottage.  I think I had more fun there this year than
I have since I was a kid, but it is still nice to be home.</p>

<p>I think the main trick will be keeping on top of everything so that
I’m not making a mad rush to get everything done on Sunday morning,
before Amy and the kids get home.  It’ll be an extra-special trick,
since Trevor’s on vacation this week, so I’ll be the lead server
developer for the two products that we’re trying to release in the
next week or so.  Ah, well.  It wouldn’t be fun without some stress,

    <p>This started off as a reply to some email on the Bazaar-NG list,

in it, and I thought it would probably be better as a weblog entry, so
that I could find it later.</p>

<p>On to the email...<br>

<p>As a related question, if I wanted other people to be able to download
my branch over http, would it suffice to do something on the server
like<br><br>
bzr init-repo ~/www/myproject<br>
cd ~/www/myproject<br>
bzr branch sftp://user@host/~/myproject/mybranch<br><br>
or would I need to push straight to ~/www/myproject/mybranch?
</p>

<p>I'm of two minds here, and I'ld like to explain why, in case it's a
common problem.  On the one hand, the repo I created by following the
steps in the first part of Martin's message<br>
&gt;   bzr init-repo sftp://user@host/~/myproject<br>
&gt;   bzr push sftp://user@host/~/myproject/mybranch<br>
should be just the same as any other repository, right?<br><br>
But, on the other hand, when I ssh to "user@host", and look in
~/myproject, all I see is a .bzr directory.  None of the files I
allegedly pushed.
</p>

<p>A search for 'bzr push "no content"' and 'bzr push missing files'
turns up nothing that makes much sense to me.  running 'bzr help push'
finally shows me the following lines:<br>
&gt; The target branch will not have its working tree populated
because<br>
&gt; this is both expensive, and is not supported on remote file
systems.<br>
which explains it at least a little.  So I started looking for a way
to push and update, which quickly led me to the push-and-update
plugin, but I'm now lost as to how to install it into my copy of bzr
(the binary distribution, running under Windows XP.)  The plugins
document that ships with bzr says "typically found in
/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/bzrlib/plugins/", but I'm really
fairly sure that's not where it's located on <i>my</i> box...  <a href="http://dpi.radiology.uiowa.edu/mifar/doc/bazaar-setup.php">another
page</a> says that it is "usually [...]
C:\python2.4\site-packages\bzrlib\plugins under Windows", but again,
that directory doesn't exist where I am.
</p>

<p>Since I expect it'll make a difference to any answer I get, let me
just say upfront that I've installed Bazaar (bzr) 0.18.0 into
C:\Program Files\Bazaar\ using the Windows standalone installer.  The
output of "bzr version" is:<br>
"""<br>
Bazaar (bzr) 0.18.0<br>
Using Python interpreter: C:\Program Files\Bazaar\bzr.exe<br>
Using Python standard library: C:\Program
Files\Bazaar\lib\library.zip<br>

Settings/blake/Application Data/bazaar/2.0<br>

"""<br><br>
So, where should I put the plugins in this case?<br></p>

<p>The answer, as given on irc, seems to be "put it somewhere else and
set the BZR_PLUGIN_PATH env variable".  Works for me, although it
would have been nice if the Windows standalone installer did that for
me, by creating a Plugins directory under the install directory.  And
as one final note, the BZR_PLUGIN_PATH, which it may contain spaces
(i.e. "C:\Program Files\Bazaar\Plugins"), must not end in a trailing
"\".</p>

    <p>Well, I fell again, in a rather spectacular fashion.  I was
crossing St. Clair on Mt. Pleasant, and had just passed a
right-turning bus (on the left!  I’m not dumb enough to try to pass a
right-turning bus on the right!), and was signaling that I was going
to go back to the right-hand side of the lane (and therefore only had
one hand on the handles) when <b>*BUMP*</b>, I hit a large ridge in
the road, which turned the tire sideways, and I went straight over the
handlebars, skidding to a stop near the curb.  My bike flew overtop of
me, crashing into a hedge.</p>

<p>As I got up, I noticed that the crash had apparently turned both my
front light and my bike computer around, which was quite a shock until
I realized that it was actually the whole handlebars which had gotten
turned around.  I spun it back and then just sort of stood there for a
while, catching my breath and calming down a little.  A lady driving
by asked me if I was okay, and if I needed a ride somewhere, but I
told her I was fine, which wasn’t entirely the truth.  My knees are
pretty much fine, a little scrape, perhaps.  My elbow is completely
ripped up, and even though I cleaned it thoroughly with soap and water
and a lot of scrubbing, it still looks pretty ugly, and is probably
going to scab up something awful.  Worse than that, my shoulder is
really sore again, in the same way that it was after <a href="random/biking/Ouch2.html">my last fall</a>, which can’t
be good.  I really need to get that looked at sometime.  The
<i>worst</i> thing, however, is that I ripped the elbow of my <a href="http://www.mec.ca/Products/product_detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524442618331&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302692363&amp;bmUID=1185298111978">cycling shirt</a>.  Yeah, I can darn it, but darn it, I liked that
shirt!  But with every negative, there comes a positive.  The power
button on my Palm TX started working again.  Weird.  Maybe the next
time I fall, the sound will come back on.</p>

<p>So, in summary, signaling on a bicycle is bad!  No, not really.
Maybe the lesson is more that bumps in the road aren’t the greatest,
especially when you don’t have your hands on the handlebars.  Other
than that, I don’t really think I have any takeaways from this one.
That intersection of St. Clair and Mt. Pleasant is treacherous,
perhaps.</p>
