    <p>Friday was a day off for us Canadians, and because I like the idea
of a four-day-weekend, I decided to take Monday off as well.  The only
down side to not working is that I don't get to ride on my daily 20
kilometer commute.  So today, inspired by an article in the Sunday
Globe and Mail about the Donut Ride (a 120 km ride around Toronto
which happens every Saturday and Sunday), I went on a ride for the
sheer joy of it while Delphine and Amy took their nap.  It's fairly
rare that I go for a ride just to go for a ride, since usually I'm
either commuting or riding somewhere to pick something up, even if
it's just over to Bayview for gelato.  Having a toddler doesn't lead
to a lot of free time, and while she's okay for shorter rides, the one
time we took her on a long ride, she got a little antsy.  (Okay, so
she was crying for the last twenty minutes, but we were  on the middle
of the Don Trail, and it doesn't exit until Lakeshore.)</p>

<p>Since I've never been on a long ride, I was wondering how far I
could go, and how long I could maintain a speed.  My route was quite
simple, through the cemetary to Bayview, then North until I was done.
All in all, I think I did fairly well for my first ride, although I
certainly made some newbie mistakes.  The most obvious mistake was
going too fast at the start of the ride.  Going down the hills, I
would shift into the highest gear, and then forget to down-shift when
I started going up the next hill.  Between that and the excessive heat
(the humidex was around 35, I believe)I was completely beat after 20
minutes.  (On the upside, my average speed for those 20 minutes was
over 27 km/h.)  So, after pulling over onto the sidewalk (and getting
a strange look from a lady out watering her lawn), and taking a water
break, I felt a lot better, and continued North.  I was hoping to ride
for one and a half to two hours, but just before the 30 minute mark, I
found myself at Finch and Bayview, and so I thought I would I cut over
to Yonge, and head home, for a total time of a little under one hour.
(57 minutes, 40 seconds.)</p>

<p>So, some more stats.  My average speed (25.7 km/h) was quite a bit
faster than normal.  (I usually average around 22-24.)  My fastest
speed (51.2 km/h) wasn't faster than normal, so I guess I was keeping
speed for longer than normal, which isn't surprising, since I didn't
have to stop for more than three or four lights on the whole ride up
to Finch.  Finally, my current odometer reading is 1808.2 km, which is
below the 1820 it would have been had I commuted on Friday and Monday,
but is still fairly impressive for someone who doesn't really think of
themselves as a cyclist.</p>

<p>Finally, in a desparate bid to get the three of you who read this
weblog to comment, I have a question.  I'm thinking of getting a
cyclocross bike for commuting in the fairly distant future.  From all
I've read, the Surly Cross Check sounds like a frame I'ld enjoy, but
they don't have dealers (any bike store can order in as many as they
want, so the stores are stuck with unsold merchandise), so I don't
know where I'ld go if I wanted to test-ride one.  Can any of you
suggest a store which might carry the Cross Check (or any other
cyclocross bikes that you like) for test rides?  (The nice lady at
<a href="http://www.ucycle.com/">The Urbane Cyclist</a> suggested
their in-house <a href="http://ucycle.com/bikes/index2.php?cat=urbanite">Urbanite
brand</a>, which looked fairly similar, but which I've heard
absolutely nothing about.</p>
