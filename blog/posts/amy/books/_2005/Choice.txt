<p>
This is a book about how more choices can make you unhappier with
the choice you finally make, and how people are inherently bad
at making decisions.  It was very interesting and gave me some insight
into my own thought processes and their emotional result.  I was 
particularly struck by the discussion about careers; as a middle-class
Westerner I can do pretty much anything I want to (provided I don't 
mind incurring a lot of debt) and that leaves me pretty much paralysed.
What if I pick wrong?  Aaah!

I would
recommend this book to just about everyone, particularly people who
feel depressed or dissatisfied with their life.  Not only does it include
a lot of information about how decision-making happens, and how it
can screw you up, the best thing about the book is that the last chapter gives
some concrete suggestions for how to deal with all the choices available
to us.
