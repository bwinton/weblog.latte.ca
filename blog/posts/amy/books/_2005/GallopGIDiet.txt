This book is about how to lose weight by eating foods with a low glycemic index.
The book is written clearly, and describes the diet in simple terms with a few
recipes and lots of hints and good ideas.  If I were going to go on a diet I
would go on something like this, except that I love bread far too much to give
it up to the extent that the diet requires.  I'd rather be fat than give up
bread.

I like that the book is written by a Canadian doctor and is clearly for a 
Canadian audience (there are other editions for other parts of the world);
he refers to Canadian brands and discusses the difficulty in getting exercise
when it's snowy and miserable half the year.
