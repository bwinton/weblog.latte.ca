While I was in Florida I read a book by Ian Rankin, a Rebus mystery.
I don't remember the name but it was the one with the school shooting,
and where Rankin kisses Siobhan at the end.  It was good.  There's
something pleasant about reading about grim, chilly Edinburgh when
you're in warm, sunny Florida.  Especially when you love Edinburgh
a lot (except for the weather) and don't really like Florida much
(although the weather is nice).

I also read the latest Minette Walters, <em>Disordered Minds</em>, 
which was also good.  Her books
always remind me of everything I hate about England, probably because
she seems to hate it too.  Actually I love England, but I wouldn't want
to live there.
