This is a thriller set in London.  It's a little freaky to read because
a lot of it is told from the point of view of the bad guy (I guess that would
be a spoiler but he is pretty obviously evil from the first few pages)
so you spend the book waiting on the edge of your seat 
for him to do something appalling.

There is a great female character -- actually all the female characters
are interesting -- who makes a surprising and gratifying decision about 
a boyfriend late in the book.  I was very pleased with Rendell when I
got to that bit; perhaps I will remember, and read more of her stuff.
