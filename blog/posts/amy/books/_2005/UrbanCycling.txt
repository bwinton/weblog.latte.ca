This is a book about how to bike in the city.  There are a couple of
dogmatic schools of thought about how you're supposed to bike in the
city (the Vehicular school and the Invisible school) and Hurst pretty
much dismantles them both.  He is very pragmatic, about where to
bike, when to bike, how to stay safe, and how to relate to other vehicles.
He has a very calm, accepting philosophy about how things are and
argues that you are better off working within reality rather than spending a
great deal of time being angry at it.  In that sense this is an 
excellent guide to how to live, as well as how to bike.
</p><p>
He did piss me off at the end by dissing my bike (I will paraphrase because
I don't have the book with me: "Comfort bikes seem to be designed for
people who want to bike while maintaining as much of a feeling of
sitting on the couch as possible.")  Okay, that's kind of why I bought
my bike, but it still smarts.  
</p><p>
Having said that, though, later he talks about how your bike should fit, 
and says that your weight should be equally distributed on your hands, 
your feet and your butt, and it's when beginners don't realize that 
that they are uncomfortable and decide to stop biking.  Well, duh, I bought
my bike with the big seat so that I could sit all my weight on my butt, and 
lo and behold, it's never really comfortable.  
</p><p>
So next time
I go out I will try and balance my weight better (I think I will have to
adjust a bunch of stuff, because right now the handlebars are pretty 
high and the seat is pretty low.)  I think, though, that that means biking
is a lot more work than I thought it was.  On the other hand, that means
that if I bike more it will make me much stronger and fitter than I thought
it would.
