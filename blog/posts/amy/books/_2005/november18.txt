<h4><em>Anne of Avonlea</em> by Lucy Maud Montgomery</h4>
<p>
I wanted to know what happened next, so I read this book despite having
heard, on numerous occasions, that the other Anne books aren't as good
as <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>.  Well, they were right.  This is
almost comical in it's not-as-goodness.  Lousy characterization,
telling-not-showing, awkward dialogue.  I don't know what came over
LMM, but it wasn't good.  I wonder if her other stuff is good, or
if <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> was a freak occurrence.

<h4><em>Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering</em> by Robert L. Glass</h4>
<p>
Why am I reading about Software Engineering?  Because I have decided when
I grow up I would like to be a software manager.  Not a librarian or a
teacher or an opera singer or a photographer, or any of the other interesting
things which have come to mind in the last, oh, ten years.  No sir, I
am plunging headlong back into software, with ambition, this time.  
Ambition to become... <em>middle management</em>.
</p><p>
How do I know it will work out for me?  Because I am reading books like
this.  For fun!  And it was fun, and interesting and edifying (since
it is pretty much the first book I have read on the topic.)  Fortunately
Glass is not skimpy with his references, so I have a whole list of other
books to look up*.  Some of which I remember from the shelves of the
Computer Science Club.  Oh, how far I have come to be back where I
started.
</p><p>
* Most of which the Toronto Public Library doesn't own!  Argh!  Do they
care nothing for software engineering?  I will have to see how well 
their "buy this book for me" system works.  Also, if anyone has any 
recommendations on the topic, I would be glad to hear them.

<h4><em>Trickle Treat</em> by Laurie Boucke</h4>
<p>
This is a book about how to potty train your baby from infancy.  The
theory is sound and the author gives a pretty good description of how
to implement it. However, as with so many other parenting books, it
is bogged down the author's sense of superiority and her disdain for
those who parent any other way than hers.  She even goes so far as 
to imply (based on a single anecdote from a friend) that diapering
your child and subsequently potty training in toddlerhood will 
emotionally damage your child for life.  I am surprised the 
attachment parenting folks haven't gotten ahold of this method, it's
right up their alley.

Also the name makes me gag.
