(This is going to be kind of boring for anyone who isn't me.
Precisely the kind of thing one shouldn't post on one's
website.)
</p><p>
Last year I apparently read around forty-five books -- those
were the ones I remembered to log, anyway, and I think I remembered
just about all of them last year.  I read eight of them from January
until May, and the other thirty-nine from June on -- yay, first
trimester fatigue.  Twenty-two since Cordelia was born -- yay,
breastfeeding!  I read fifteen fiction and
thirty-one non-fiction, and two collections of short stories.
I'm really into non-fiction these days; I find non-fiction books
to be more rich with ideas than novels are, and I'm very
keen on thinking about the world lately.  There's a lot to think
about...

I'm glad I started reading again -- for a while, starting in
high school, I hardly read at all, but I have learned so much
in the last few years from reading books written by clever people.
I shudder to think how boring and ignorant I would be if I 
hadn't read the books that I have read.
</p><p>
In short: books, good.  News at eleven.
