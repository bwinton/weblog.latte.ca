...now with short reviews.
</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Accomodating Brocolli in the Cemetary or Why Can't Anybody Spell?</em>
    by Vivian Cook.  Fun, more list-y than I expected.  Good for reading on
    the crapper.</li>
<li><em>Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores The Hidden Side of 
    Everything</em> by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner.
    Thought-provoking, stats-based perspectives on just about everything.</li>
<li><em>One Summer's Grace: A Family Voyage Around Britain</em> by Libby Purves.
    I love Libby Purves.  I wish she lived next door to me and could come by
    for tea.</li>
<li><em>The Well-Ordered Home: Organizing Techniques for Inviting Serenity Into
    Your Life</em> by Kathleen Kendall-Tacket.  Apparently I already have
    a well-ordered home, because I didn't find anything particularly new
    in this book.  That is as I expected, and 
    not to say that wouldn't be useful to you, if you do not find your 
    home to be well-ordered.  (I only took it out because it's by one
    of the authors of the nursing book I just read, and I was curious.)</li>
<li><em>The Devil's Feather</em> by Minette Walters.  Minette Walters
    is always great, and this one was better than usual because she
    didn't spend so much time being bitter and miserable about the
    English.  This book ate an entire day of my life, which is pretty
    clever considering I am supposed to spend my days looking after 
    my children, not reading thrillers.</li>
<li><strike><em>The World is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century</em> by
    Thomas L. Friedman</strike>. I didn't finish this before it came due at the
    library; what I did get through wasn't anything 
    new to me, since it was mostly about
    the Internet revolution, and I was there studying or working in software
    when Netscape came out and when the web got big and Y2K and so on.  Towards
    the end of the book I think he gets into the social implications of the
    world being flat (ie, geography no longer being a limiting factor in
    the economy) but I didn't get to that part.  I wasn't sorry -- this was
    one of those books I read because I felt I ought to, not because I
    was really interested.</li>
<li><em>Willow and Twig</em> by Jean Little.  Loved this.</li>
<li><em>You Don't Have To Be Thin To Win: The Official Chub Club Coach's
    Workout Program</em> by Judy Molnar. Inspiring, if a little impractical --
    I am not about to train for a triathlon, or even a marathon; who has
    hours every day to work out?  (Having said that, I did put 
    Cordelia in the big stroller and go for an hour-long brisk
    walk today.  Like I said, inspiring.)</li>
<li><em>Goblin Market</em> by Christina Rosetti.  Why have I never
    come across this before?  Creepy and good -- I would love to see
    <a href="http://leontinemay.blogspot.com/">Leontine</a> illustrate
    this.</li>
<li><em>Goodnight Nobody</em> by Jennifer Weiner.  I wasn't sure about
    this at first because the protagonist doesn't really seem to like
    her children very much, but as it turns out she was just having one
    of those days, and also her husband was an asshole.  I can't imagine
    dealing with kids without a good, helpful, <em>present</em> husband
    at my side.  I think I would rather be not married at all than
    married to someone who was never home and not helpful when he was.
    But I digress.  (You have to read that in a South African accent,
    because I always say it with one in my head.  I'm not sure why.)
    Very fun book; I am happy Jennifer Weiner has written two more books
    I haven't read yet.</li>
</ul>
