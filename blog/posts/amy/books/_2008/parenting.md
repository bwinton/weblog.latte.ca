Here are the parenting books I read in 2008, sorted
into two categories:

<h4>Books that Made me Say "Enh"</h4>

These are books which were pretty useful but didn't
change my world view or particularly affect my 
parenting style.

- ***Curious Minds ed.*** __by John Brockman__
- ***Toilet Training the Brazelton Way*** __by T. Berry 
Brazelton and Joshua Sparrow__
- ***Children: The Challenge*** __by Rudolph Dreikurs__
- ***Parent Talk*** __by Stanley Shapiro and Karen Skinulis__
- ***Your Five-Year-Old: Sunny and Serene*** __by Ames and Ilg__
- ***The Highly Sensitive Child*** __by Elaine Aron__
- ***Siblings Without Rivalry*** __by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish__
- ***The Money-Tree Myth*** __by Gail Vaz-Oxlade__

<h4>Awesome Books</h4>

These are the books which either blew me away with their
insight or actually changed how I view my role
as a parent.

- ***Breaking The Good Mom Myth: Every Mom's Modern Guide to Getting Past Perfection, Regaining Sanity, and Raising Great Kids*** __by Alyson Schafer__ is
about democratic parenting, the notion that kids are actually
much more competent than they are given credit for, and that
we must give them more responsibility to allow them to grow
into competent and independent adults.  (This philosophy
also says that we should allow our children to experience
the consequences of their decisions, which has unfortunately
led to people using "consequence" as a euphemism for 
"punishment".  If there's a point, some folk are bound to
miss it.)  

    This book changed how I parent; I used to fret
so much about how to get them to tidy their rooms,
how to get them to dress appropriately outside, how to 
get them to play nicely together.  Schafer points out
that you can't really "get" kids to do things, but you
can treat them like human beings, explain the situation,
help them make their own decisions and then live with 
them.  The problem, of course, is that you have to live
with their decisions too, but as long as you remember that
your kids are not in fact tiny extensions of yourself, 
that's usually not really a problem.  The nice thing is
that once something is your kid's responsibility it's
no longer yours!  Hooray!
- ***Punished by Rewards: The Trouble with Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A's, Praise, and Other Bribes*** __by Alfie Kohn__.  I was
led to this book by the Schafer book, which is a bit
ironic because Kohn tears a strip off the democratic parenting
crowd for their euphemistic "consequences" and their
apparent lack of sympathetic support for little kids.
Anyway, this book is about how rewards (praise, stickers,
grades, incentives, commissions, bonuses) are actually
counterproductive in parenting and in business.  

    Kohn is brilliant and very compelling and has
led me to fundamentally change my parenting style.
I now almost never praise the girls and never reward them,
and I am very conscious of intrinsic versus extrinsic
motivation in myself as well as them.  Absolutely everyone
should read this book, whether parents, teachers, employers,
managers, or anyone else.
- ***Parenting Beyond Belief: On Raising Ethical, Caring Kids Without Religion*** __by Dale McGowan__ is a
collection of essays about raising children in a household
without religion or other superstition.  I was casting about
for support in this area when I discovered this book, apparently
the only one on this topic.  It's a great book, interesting
and funny and insightful.
- ***The Boy Who Was Raised As A Dog: And Other Stories from a Child Psychiatrist's Notebook: What Traumatized Children Can Teach Us About Loss, Love and Healing*** __by Bruce Perry__ is
a book about how the development of children who have undergone 
extreme trauma can teach us about normal mental development.
It is fascinating, inspiring and at times grueling.  Another
must-read for anyone who has or works with children.
