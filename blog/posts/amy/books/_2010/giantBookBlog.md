I haven't properly book blogged since, I think, July. And even then I
don't think I actually caught up, I only posted about a handful of books.
It's time for one of those clearout book blogs where I just post
all the stuff I've read without much comment. Those suck for everyone,
but they satisfy my slightly obsessive need to record every book I read here. 

Incidentally, I tried Goodreads, and I think it's a really neat idea
but it's not working for me. I like to keep my book list close to
home (which is to say, here on Blog-o!). I expect I will still use it
to research books and get ideas.

Without further ado, here are the books I've read this year:

***A Spot of Bother*** by Mark Haddon is the last book I finished.
It was lent to me by a friend (Janet!). It's the story of a middle-class
English man who has just retired, and who discovers a patch of 
diseased skin on his hip. This leads him to confront his mortality in
a dramatic manner, while still attempting to maintain his dignity
and not make a fuss. I started off not liking the lead character, but
after a few chapters I understood and liked him, and I liked
all the other characters, too; they were well-written and engaging. 

Time is running out and I apparently don't have time to write about 
any more books I've read, so here's the list, sorted into moderately
helpful sub-lists:

[^tracks]: Here's a quick review I wrote for *Tracks*: A couple of years ago I had a book swap party&mdash;a bunch of friends came over with few books they were done with, and we talked about books and life and everyone left with a new (to them) book. This was one of the books I picked up. It's about Fleur Pillager, an Anishnabe woman with mysterious powers, and the people around her. It's told alternately by Nanapush, an old man speaking to his grand-daughter, and Pauline. I wouldn't have picked this book out at the library, but I enjoyed it, especially Nanapush's quiet humour.

[^campnurse]: Here are my notes about *Camp Nurse*: - about her experiences as camp nurse at three different camps - one chaotic and disorganized (socialist), one fancy and over-structured and one just right - Jewish camp which includes differently abled and sick kids as well as kids sponsored by the United Way. Discussed what makes a kid a "good camper" (in the conformist fancy camp). Lots of discussion of various ailments from splinters to strokes, seizures, infections, and a camp-wide norovirus. Made me want to send my kids to (a carefully selected) camp, which is expensive but counts as childcare for tax purposes!  Author has two other books which I would like to check out.

[^goddelusion]: Here are my notes about *The God Delusion*: Useful vocabulary and buttresses arguments about god - some parts of book seem beside the point (memes) - not sure about his vehemence about referring to "a Jewish child", etc; seems to be the old culture versus religion problem. Reminded me of Douglas Adams: boo hoo.
