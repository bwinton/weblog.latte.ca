Last year I made some kind of resolution about reading half the books on my To
Be Read shelf. Our bookshelf (it's a 5 by 5 <a
href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/80156281">Expedit</a>, which
they apparently don't make anymore) has little squares, and right now my TBR
pile is taking up two cubbies. I wanted to reduce it to one, but somehow the
size of my TBR pile remains constant.

Like everyone, I imagine, I tend to avoid particular books. Various reasons:
maybe a book seems hard, maybe it's one I feel I "should" read but don't
actually want to, maybe I'm just never in the mood. Anyway, I find that some
books lurk in the TBR shelf for months and years while some just disappear
within weeks.  This year I decided to steel myself and tackle the shelf
alphabetically.

So here it is:

- Atwood, Margaret: *Moral Disorder* (my mother sent me this)
- Conrad, Joseph: *Lord Jim* (this is a "should" read)
- Didion, Joan: *The Year of Magical Thinking*
- Faber, Adele and Elaine Mazlich: *Siblings Without Rivalry* (a 
  necessary re-read)
- Frey, Stephen: *The Power Broker*
- Gardiner, John Reynolds: *Stone Fox* (Delphine recommended this)
- Goldreich, Gloria: *Open Doors* (my mother sent this too)
- Grenville, Kate: *The Idea of Perfection*
- Harris, Marvin: *Cannibals and Kings* (I picked this up at someone's curb;
  it seems thinky and interesting but maybe totally dated.)
- Hawking, Stephen: *George's Secret Key to the Universe* (I borrowed this
  from a friend; I'm interested in it in theory but the cover is so tacky
  it's putting me off.)
- Hegi, Ursula: *Stones from the River*
- Hochschild, Adam: *Bury the Chains* (I got this as a gift from 
  <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/">Greg Wilson</a>. It's about
  the dismantlement (that is *so* a word) of slavery.)
- Khan, Rukhsana: *Wanting Mor*
- McCarthy, Cormac: *All The Pretty Horses* (Because I read *The Road*
  and I'm a huge masochist.)
- McLaren, Leah: *The Continuity Girl* (see above re: masochist)

- McLaughlin, Emma and Nicola Krause: *The Nanny Diaries* (A friend
  swears this is better than it looks.) 
- McDonough, William and Michael Braungart: *Cradle to Cradle* (This is
  a book about sustainable design which I'm halfway through and can't finish.
  It's just so dry. I'm going to give it one more effort.)
- Monbiot, George: *Heat*
- Munro, Alice: *The View from Castle Rock* (My mother sent me this, too.
  She *loves* Alice Munro and thinks we should read this in book
  club.)
- Nemirovsky, Irene: *Suite Francaise*
- Ondaatje, Michael: *The English Patient* (My friend who liked *The Nanny
  Diaries* hates this book but I have another friend who loves it, so I just
  don't know what to think. I guess I'll have to read it and judge for myself.)
- Petroski, Henry: *The Evolution of Useful Things* (This is another one I've
  started but got bogged down with. I want to like it, though; the subject
  matter is interesting.)
- Ritter, Erika: *The Dog By the Cradle, the Serpent Beneath* (This is a book
  that I was interested in, so I grabbed it at a book sale or off the curb
  or something.)
- Sebold, Alice: *The Lovely Bones*
- Stross, Charles: *Iron Sunrise* (A while ago I said I wanted to start
  reading sf again, but I made a horrible misstep (in my earnest search for 
  CanCon) and read a Robert Sawyer book. I still haven't recovered, but I
  hope this book will bring me back into the fold.)
- Weatherford, Jack: *Indian Givers: How the Indians of the Americas 
  Transformed the World* (This is the Indian version of that book about how
  the Scots are responsible for everything cool ever. Maybe I will read them
  both and declare a winner.)
- Zinnser, William: *On Writing Well*
- Blume, Judy: *Summer Sisters*

(The last thing on that shelf is the choral score to Mendelssohn's *Elijah*,
which we are performing this spring. I just put it there to have it handy
when we start rehearsing at the end of this month.)

There are a couple of rules. You'll see that the Judy Blume book is out
of order: that's my wild card. If I just can't face the next book on
the list, I get to read *Summer Sisters*. It's my only wild card, so
I have to use it wisely.

Also I can interrupt the sequence at any time for library books, book club
books, or books which need to be read right away for another reason, like
how-to books.

Let's see how far through the alphabet I get this year.
