This poor blog has been sorely neglected, and especially the book blog.
I feel like I haven't been reading much&mdash;I certainly don't get big
blocks of time reading time very often&mdash;but I've managed to plough through
a few books while brushing my teeth or waiting in line or taking the bus.
I think these are most of them, although I always manage to forget a few.
