A few days ago I had this exchange on Twitter:

**@amyrhoda:** Yay, I finished a book off my TBR shelf! And added four more in
the meantime... \*headdesk\*

**@ryan_price:** ha! I just added 3 books yesterday... But i didnt finish
another :(

What I didn't tell Ryan was that three of the four books I added were
children's novels or YA novels. Since then I read two of them, and then
realized that the last one wasn't in keeping with my <a
href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/books/_2011/TBR.html">Alphabetical Reading
List Plan</a> , so I set it aside. (I'm adding new books to the end of the TBR
pile; I can't read them until I've won the alphabet.)

These are the books I read:

***Fairy Haven and the Quest for the Wand*** __by Gail Carson Levine__. Once
upon a time I told myself I would read all the books my kids read. I don't know
what crack I was smoking, because a) I don't even have time to read the books
*I* want to read, b) Delphine reads about a million books a day, and c)
she reads some serious crap. Good stuff too, but lots of crap.

This one intrigued me, though. On the one hand, Disney. (That's bad.)
On the other, Gail Carson Levine. (That's good.) On the one hand, fairies.
(That's bad.) On the other... Gail Carson Levine? Well, and I also 
love the illustrations, by David Christiana. And Delphine really enjoyed it.

So I gave it a read, and hey, it turns out to be pretty good. The fairy
characters are interesting and well-rounded, in non-obvious ways. (Turns out
Tinkerbell fixes things - she's a tinkerer, get it?) The conflict was exciting,
the climax was thrilling, the writing was lovely. Gail Carson Levine trumps
Disney!

***Hoping For Home: Stories of Arrival*** is from the *Dear Canada* series of
historical novels written as diaries. This one is a collection of short
stories about immigration.  (Well, and one about an aboriginal girl, which I
guess was put in for political correctness but since it's not actually about
crossing the Bering Strait/Pacific Ocean thousands of years ago I think
it's a bit of a stretch to include it in a collection about immigration; and
another story which I'm not sure what it was about.) The authors include
Rukhsana Khan, Paul Yee, and Jean Little. For some reason I love immigration
stories, maybe because I immigrated/emigrated so often as a kid, maybe because
I find the fact that people choose Canada as their home perversely 
flattering, definitely because I am in awe of the courage of people who
come here with so little resources and so much hope. 

Whatever it is, this book satisfied me with lots of good stories, although I'm
not a great fan of the diary conceit. I often felt that the writing was too
good to be a diary, especially a child's diary, and that pulled me out of the
story.  The author who really captured a child's voice was Brian Doyle. I also
particularly enjoyed Paul Yee's story of a boy joining his father in small-town
Saskatchewan; he brings the reader on the same voyage of discovery that
the protagonist is taking.

Incidentally, this book was a cheat on my Alphabetical Reading List Plan; it is
a book we own, so I should have put it at the end of the list. (The Levine was
a library book so I had to read it before we returned it.) I just forgot...
