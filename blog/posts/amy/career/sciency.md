This morning while I was hanging up laundry in the basement,
I was thinking about stuff.  Mainly I was thinking about the
clever, interesting people at the party yesterday and trying
to figure out how I could spend more time with, or maybe work
with, clever, interesting people like that.  (Not that I didn't
work with clever, interesting people in software; in fact,
that's one of my favourite things about software.  Love me
some geeks.)  I was casting my mind about, musing on this
and that, on academia and science and research and clever
people doing interesting things, when it came to me:

I don't want to do science.

I don't know why that seemed like such a bombshell, but it seemed
very exciting at the time.  (It doesn't take much when
you're hanging cold wet t-shirts in a cold wet basement.)
I love science, I love facts,
I love knowing about the latest studies and ideas, but
I don't want to do the research myself.  I'm more interested
in getting things done (with the best new knowledge) than
in finding things out.  I love that other people are finding
things out but I just want to know what they've got.

So a career in dusty academia is not for me, which makes
this not much of an epiphany because I never thought it
was.  However, hanging out with Greg Wilson's clever friends
made me think that I would like to work close to
science, applying or disseminating the latest studies
and discoveries.  Blake's suggestion was science outreach,
and I also think science writing could be cool.  The other
idea that popped into my head was urban planning.  I feel 
like there must be some way to take scientific knowledge
and apply it to public policy, maybe try and get us out of
this mess we're in.

So many ideas.
