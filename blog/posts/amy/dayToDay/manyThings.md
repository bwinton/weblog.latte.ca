I was recently offered the opportunity to work on a very cool project. At the
moment I'm finishing up <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/">AOSA</a> and working
on another book, plus I am taking a six week online course, but this new
project didn't start until late summer, so I agreed.

Or so I thought. There was some confusion on my part, and as it turns out, the
new project starts right away. There's no way I want to pass up this
opportunity, though, so I'm going to have to squeeze some more hours out of my
day. Somehow.

My first intention is to spend the first part of the work day on billable work.
It sounds dumb, but I have so many other things to do &mdash; answering email,
administration, networking, blog posts, AOSA, volunteer work for the girls'
school, the course, and household jobs like signing the girls up for things
&mdash; that some days I don't do any billable work at all. As a result my
projects drag on and I feel like a dud. 

My second intention is to wake up at 6:00 every day. Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays I will go straight to the gym so I can work out before breakfast;
Tuesdays and Thursdays I will do housework and household admin tasks, so they
don't eat into my working day. That means I have to head to bed at 10:15 to be
asleep by 10:45. (Seven hours and fifteen minutes seems to be enough sleep.) I
hope I will settle in to that sleep cycle so that I wake up early on the
weekends, too; that time I will use to read!

My third intention is to finish the AOSA project in one fell swoop. I'm waiting
on a volunteer to create the epub (thank you!) and once that's done I will set
aside a day or two to finish all the little admin and website jobs
which I could otherwise safely (but guiltily) ignore forever.

And finally I have a bad habit of half-watching TV, half-working in the
evenings. I hope I will be more effective with this new schedule and won't need
to work in the evenings. If there's something on I actually want to watch, I
intend to set aside other things and watch it (!); if I'm just keeping Blake
company while he watches something I'm not so interested in, I will work on
personal or family stuff.

I spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to fit all the things I want to
do into my day (and cursing my excessive need for sleep.) I'm optimistic about
this plan; it seems both doable and effective.

breakfast</a>.)
