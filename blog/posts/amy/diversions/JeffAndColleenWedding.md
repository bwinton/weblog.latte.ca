Back in March of 1999, I started working at a small software
company downtown. I got there about a week before their 
network administrator quit, to be replaced by a quiet guy named
Jeff. Jeff was an agreeable fellow who would listen
patiently when I wandered into his office to talk his ear off
about last night's TV or the latest movie I'd seen. It soon
became apparent that Jeff had a formidable memory for facts
and details; he could identify obscure actors, recall
chemical names and properties from his grad school days, and
could reel off all kinds of sports minutiae which still don't
mean anything to me.  You could talk to Jeff about just about
anything&mdash;food, science, sports, celebrity gossip&mdash;and 
he would be able to hold up his side of the conversation.

Jeff soon became my number one work buddy, my go-to guy whenever
I needed a break from my computer and wanted a chat, my
faithful lunchtime companion, my reference for all things
operating system-y, my fellow sufferer of workplace bullshit. 
Once we skipped out of work for the afternoon to see *The 
Perfect Storm*.

A year or so after I met Jeff, I started taking singing lessons.
The girl whose lesson came after mine was named Kathryn; our
music teacher introduced us once, but I didn't pay much attention
because I'm a lazy cuss with limited social skills. My laziness
came back to haunt me when a few weeks later a pretty, animated
girl walked up to me in choir practice. "Hi, Amy!"

Blank stare.

"It's Kathryn! From singing lessons?"

Oh, yeah. I'm a dork.

Fortunately [Kathryn](http://inquisiturient.blogspot.com/) forgave 
me and we became fast friends. One
day I invited some friends from work, and Kathryn, over to play
Trivial Pursuit, eat pizza and drink beer. Jeff, as usual, kicked
our asses in Trivial Pursuit because he never forgets anything
he's ever learned. Kat was struck by the breadth of his knowledge
and also his unassuming, agreeable manner. She decided he would
be a perfect match for her little sister Colleen, herself a
games nut and formidable repository of trivia.

But first we had to wait for Colleen to break up with her boyfriend
at the time. Then we had to try and get the two of them together
in the same room. That took a couple of years. Finally in September
of 2007, they were both invited to our deck party, Colleen 
with specific, illustrated instructions
to seek out and interact with Jeff. Sure enough the pair of them
hit it off and chatted all night. Kat and I nudged
them together over the next couple of days, and...

Yesterday they were married.

The ceremony was at U of T's Miller Lash house in Scarborough. It was
short, sweet and sunshiney (most of the female guests
seem to have gone home with the sunburn booby prize, myself
included). There followed a long break for lunch, during which Blake and
I came back into the city to drop the girls off with Baba and
Zaida, and (in my case at least) take a nap. Refreshed, I trowelled
on some spackle (I mean makeup), wired my underwear and outerwear
together, glued my hair in place, wrestled with some strappy
sandals, and thanked God I don't have to
look like a girl every day. Finally Blake and I caught the #54
bus and rode it all the way to the end of the line, for the 
reception at the
East Rouge Community Centre. "Community Centre" conjures up
images of sweaty basketball courts and ice rinks, but this is 
actually a very classy venue, an elegantly casual, good-sized hall 
with a balcony and a fireplace.

This might sound a little bit lame, but I was really excited to
go to this wedding reception. Between being a stay-at-home mum
and economising, we never go out for a fancy dinner, and I haven't
gone dancing since Delphine was born. The idea of a nice dinner
with tablecloths and wine and interesting company, followed by
dancing, was pretty thrilling. Fortunately (considering the commute)
the night more than lived up to my expectations. 

Dinner was served buffet-style, with chicken stuffed with goat cheese
and peppers, and grilled sirloin with caramelized onions and a selection
of sauces, grilled polenta, orzo salad, caesar salad, and little potatoes.
For dessert there were butter tarts, lemon tarts, meringues with lemon
custard, brownies, homemade Italian cookies, and berries and whipped 
cream. Oh, and wedding cake after that! Gastronomic bliss, and my
wine glass was never empty.

After a few short but heartfelt speeches, there was great music for
dancing. Blake doesn't dance, and at first I was too self-conscious
to dance "by myself", but soon enough I was dancing with a bunch
of girls and having an awesome time.

But enough about what a great time *I* had last night&mdash;it's 
wonderful to see Jeff get married, and it's gravy (for me&mdash;what?
It's *my* weblog!) that he married someone I'm connected to in
another way. Because Kat and I are so close, and I'm so fond of
Jeff, I feel like this marriage has created 
a circle of connections which somehow vaguely includes me.
I hope Colleen and Jeff are happy together forever, and
I hope they (and Kat) stay a part of my life for just as long.
