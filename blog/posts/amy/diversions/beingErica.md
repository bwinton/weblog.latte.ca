I mentioned briefly in my last post that Blake and I have
started watching a show called *Being Erica*.  It's about
a 32-year-old Toronto woman who gets a chance to travel
back in time and revisit some bad decisions from her past.
We're really enjoying it;  the characterization is
good, the scripts are funny, the music is AWESOME, and 
of course it's perfectly our age group so everything is
sometimes painfully close to home.  And it's SO Toronto
and so Canadian: lots of location shots, Molson Canadian,
sex in a canoe.

So Blake said, "I should totally tell Morgan to watch this,
with the graduating in '94 and the trips to Muskoka."  And
I said, "Yeah, I want to tell Kat about it, too."  Kat and
Morgan and I are all '75ers, and I think Kat would really
enjoy this show and relate, too.

And finally I wonder if my New York friends Sascha and Leontine
would like it -- they love Canada and Toronto so maybe
they'd get a kick out of it, if they have time to watch
TV.

Anyway (I think) all those people read this blog, so 
consider yourselves notified.  (Kat, we have them downloaded
if you want to watch them here.)
