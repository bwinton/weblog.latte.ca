You know how all makeup claims it's the best thing since they
invented makeup, and it will change your life?  Well, Cover Girl 
LashExact won't change your life, but it does do what it claims, which
is not clump.  As far as I can tell the goo in the bottle is
the same as ever, but the wand is new technology; it's not
regular bristles like a normal mascara brush, but little plastic
bristles very evenly spaced.  It works a dream.

The next thing I like is something my mother sent us, a set of
three CDs called <a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=6717773&amp;style=music&amp;cart=312913608&amp;BAB=E">100 Silly Songs</a>. 
It has every kid's song you have ever heard, plus a few
that haven't been heard for decades because they're quite
politically incorrect, like "The King of the Cannibal
Islands", or "I Wish I Were A Little Bar of Soap".  They're 
all nicely arranged and well-sung, with
complete verses.  It's almost like a reference CD.

The last thing I have bought that I like is my new
<a href="http://www.myfullerbrush.com/tidy.htm">crumb sweeper</a>.
I didn't get that brand -- mine is much cuter -- but the idea
is the same.  It works really well at picking up the crumbs
off the tablecloth after Delphine the barbarian has
eaten -- I just, swoosh, sweep it across the table and the
crumbs are gone as if by magic.  
(I use a tablecloth because our table is wood and I
want to keep it nice until the children have manners and are
less prone to drumming on the table with their forks and
such.)  I am looking forward to the post-croissant cleanup on
Sunday.
