'Tis the season for acquisitiveness, but honestly, I want
stuff all year 'round.  I don't expect anyone to get me
any of this, because we're not "doing" presents this
year and anyway Blake never buys me anything that he knows I 
want.  Some kind of perverse male pride thing, like not
asking for directions.  So this
list is really just for my amusement.

This is what I want right now:

* a classic French mandoline
* a [long fleece nightie](http://www.landsend.com/pp/LongSleeveDreamFleeceMidcalfNightgown~189811_57.html?bcc=y&action=order_more&sku_0=::TVY&CM_MERCH=IDX_00002__0000000201&origin=index) for those mornings when I just don't want to get out of bed.  (Isn't it nice when you imagine your perfect whatever, and then it turns out someone else has designed and manufactured it?)
* too many books to name.
* ballerina-style slippers like [this](http://www.landsend.com/pp/TerryTravelSlipperswithBag~188844_-1.html?bcc=y&action=order_more&sku_0=::CHH&CM_MERCH=IDX_00002__0000000184&origin=index)
* a new bra.  I've been wearing the same two nursing bras for three years now.  They are so done.  I'm not even nursing any more!  I also need another running bra.  Except I don't know what size I am, so I have to go to the store and get measured properly.
* another computer so I can do computer stuff while we watch TV (our computer
  is our TV).  Actually Blake just bought a new computer so in theory
  I could borrow his.
* protective [table pads](http://ptpads.com/index2.html); back before we
  even thought about having kids we bought an elegant, flawless 
  wood dining table.  Turns out it shows every scratch and fingerprint.  
  So now 
  I keep it covered with a cloth tablecloth over a vinyl
  tablecloth.  It looks awful but it works.  Now, those table pads I
  linked to look really tacky because apparently they haven't redone their
  marketing material since 1982, but I was at the house of a friend who
  has them and they actually look really great.  I thought she had a
  cool leather-embossed table at first.  They're only a couple hundred
  bucks and I really should have bought some by now.
* a [long down coat](http://tinyurl.com/5aolg3) for those freezing
  afterschool pickups.  Not black, though, or I will look like all
  the other North Toronto moms in their long black down coats.
