It seems like every time I turn around I am reminded of how incompetent
I am.  The kitchen full of dirty dishes reminds me I am an incompetent
housewife.  The broken dishwasher reminds me I am an incompetent earner.
The baby who won't sleep in her own crib reminds me I am an incompetent
mother.  The neglected emails remind me I am an incompetent friend.
</p><p>
Everything seems so hard, so uphill, like wading through molasses.  The
hardest thing in the world really is living in it.  I keep waiting for
it to become easier, to become like other people's lives seem to be, 
so effortless and effective, and it never does.  A nice condo doesn't
do it, losing weight doesn't do it, even having money, if I recall 
correctly, didn't do it.  I think life is just difficult.  But I also
remind myself that it will be easier in a couple of years, when Delphine
has some physical autonomy and doesn't need my attention <em>all the
time</em>.  After that, by comparison, everything really <em>will</em> be easy!
I hope.

In the meantime, if anyone out there is granting wishes, I would like
to find a nice daycare that will take good care of my baby two days a
week. I would like a job which pays me enough to pay for the daycare,
with some left over.  I would like a dishwasher that works.  I would like
someone to vacuum and clean my bathrooms.  I would like Delphine to sleep
in her own crib, fall asleep at eight every night and wake up at seven
the next morning.  I would like some clothes that fit and a couple of pairs
of cute shoes.

I think that's all.  Thanks!
