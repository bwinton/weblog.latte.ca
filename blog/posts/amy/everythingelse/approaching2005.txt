It's New Year's Eve.  Blake and I invited a few people over, casual-like,
but for one reason or another no-one is coming, so it's just the two
of us.  Delphine went to bed at 6:30 and we tidied up (I hate to start the
new year with a messy house) and now we're watching Firefly and eating
party food leftover from Christmas: stilton and crackers, chips and dip,
peanuts, soda and gingerbread.  I hope to be able to stay awake until 
midnight, although I don't expect I'll have a drink since I am once again
in post-ovulatory limbo.

2004 was good to me, I must say.  Nothing much happened; a trip to Florida,
a trip to Las Vegas, a trip to Saskatchewan (I travel too much) and not
really much else other than day-to-day life, with choir and visits to and
from Morgan and Baba and Zaide, and baby things.

In 2005 I am going to:
<ul>
 <li>have a baby</li>
 <li>work (for money)</li>
 <li>go back to eating healthy, and maybe even healthier than that</li>
 <li>paint the kitchen</li>
 <li>do some yoga</li>
 <li>knit</li>
 <li>pollute less</li>
 <li>take Delphine swimming more</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
I'm looking forward to it; I think 2005 will be good to me too.
