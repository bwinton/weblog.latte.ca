I'm not sure where to post this, but I saved it because it
rings so true for me.  It's
from Robert Sapolsky's Essay, "Mountain Gorilla and Yeshiva Boy", in
<em>Curious Minds: How A Child Becomes A Scientist</em>.  He
describes an epiphany:

> ...<em>There is no God.  This is gibberish.</em>

> Since then, I've had no religion, in fact no capacity for spirituality
> of any sort whatsoever.  There is no facet of my life — love, parenting,
> mulling over why we are here — that I view outside the context of
> mechanistic science.  For me, there is no Divine Watchmaker — no top-down
> volition, no purpose, no cause beyond what emerges from the complexity
> of biological systems.  This is no a cold point of view: I am as
> intensely emotional now as I was at the age of thirteen, and I don't find
> science and emotionality to be at all contradictory.  Nor do I believe
> that science is an emotional substitute for religion.  But for me, it
> has finally made the religious worldview impossible.
