Delphine and I have been reading some classic
chapter books about kindergarteners, like
<em>Ramona</em> and the <em>Betsy</em> books.
(By the way, if anyone can recommend any other
books/series in that vein I would love to hear
it!)  I am struck by how early these kids walk
to school alone: specifically, early kindergarten.
Ramona was written in the sixties and Betsy
was written in the thirties.  So, apart from
the cars which I agree are a concern, what has
changed in the world since then that prevents
us from letting our kindergartners walk to school?
Nothing.  But we don't because of some irrational,
formless fear that Something Bad will happen to
our children if we don't supervise their every
move.

I'm thrilled to find a website of people who
don't want to wrap their children in bubble-wrap,
and I'm astonished I didn't find it before now:
<a href="http://freerangekids.wordpress.com/">Free
Range Kids</a>.  I don't have time to read much
now but I'm looking forward to exploring this
website!  And in the meantime I might even let my
kids play in the front yard without supervision!
I'm a maverick.
