Our neighbourhood loves Hallowe'en.  At least half of the 
houses, it seems, are decorated, and the sidewalks were so
thick with trick or treaters last night that most people
weren't even bothering to close their doors between
visitors.  On our block most of our neighbours were sitting
on the front porch steps chatting; some with wine, some
without.
</p>
<p>
We decorated our house with three pumpkins (remember when
one jack o' lantern was enough?) and three bats made from
our leftover NDP campaign sign, painstakingly cut out and
coloured with black magic marker.  We also used the 
uprights upon which said sign was mounted to string a 
spiderweb to which I glued a spider, also made from
the sign.  (I decided I wasn't going to buy anything
last month so we had to make our own decorations from
whatever we had at hand.  Thank goodness there had been
an election!)  It all looked pretty awesome,
and all the more satisfying since we didn't just buy it
at the dollar store.  I guess today I should
take it all down.

Last night Cordelia was dressed as a bumblebee, with 
yellow and black
tights and a pair of sparkly wings.  (The headband with 
antennae came off pretty early and Morgan and I ended
up wearing it.)  She loved trick or treating, and she
wouldn't let anyone else hold her bag of candy even when
it was almost too heavy for her to carry.  She learned
to say "t'ick a t'eat!" and "t'anks!" right away.  Well,
with prompting.
</p>

Delphine was a bunny, with fluffy ears, a beige hoodie (bunnyhug!) 
and a cottontail sewed to her white skirt.  She was into
trick or treating until she hit the Brick Wall of Sleepiness
at around 7:15 and refused to get off the 
<a href="http://www.lascal.se/html/kb_models01.aspx">kiddy 
board</a> until we got home.  Cordelia trick or treated
at a couple of different houses after that and when Delphine
was asked if she wanted some candy she said "No thanks."
When that kid is tired, she is tired.

<p>
After we got home and sorted through Delphine's candy,
and ate some, we put the girls to bed (an hour late!)
Then Blake and I picked through their respective booty
and set aside the thirty most succulent (and safe, and
appropriate) pieces (one for
each day in November) for each girl, and kept the rest for ourselves!
Well, Blake will take them to work and fatten up his
colleagues.  Then we sat and watched <em>Band Candy</em> and
ate chocolate until we were done eating chocolate.  Which,
for reference, means we ate a lot of chocolate.  Mmmm...
