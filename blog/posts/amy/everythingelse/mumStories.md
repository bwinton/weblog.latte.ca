Here's a story from my mother.

She used to be in the Stoke-on-Trent Choral Society, and one year they
did Bach's St Matthew Passion. There was a doctor on staff at the hospital
(North Staffs Infirmary? &ndash; I have a very vague idea of 
the timelines of my mother's pre-me life) nicknamed "Deadly Earnest"
who loved Bach &ndash; that might have been all he ever listened to.
(He was from Leeds, my mother's from North Staffordshire, so you'll
have to imagine the accents if you know them.)  So she said to him,

"Are you going to come out and hear the St Matthew Passion, then?"

"Oh, I dunno.  You'll prob'ly muck it up."

"Oh, go on!"

So he did come out and hear it, and afterwards she asked what he
thought.

"Wunt bad."

High praise indeed.

I know that's not a funny story or anything. But my mother tells millions
of these little, pointless but telling slice-of-life stories (most of 
them for the fourth or fifth time) and I've
just been letting them wash over me all my life. But it's starting to
set in that, like fossil fuels, my mother's stories are a non-renewable
resource and I had better start saving them.
