I know. It’s a bit late. I meant to post this earlier, but then life… 

(And I realized that the reason you post your New Year’s Resolutions as soon as
you can is that it’s embarrassing to post them after you’ve already broken
them.)

Here they are:

#### 1. Increase my machine time at the gym from 20 minutes to 30 minutes.

My gym routine is almost literally the least I can do: twenty minutes on a
machine, usually the elliptical, and then fifteen minutes or more of
stretching. I’m really there for the stretching, because if I don’t do it
regularly sooner or later my back goes into spasm.

But I figured another ten minutes can’t be too hard to come by, and a
bit more cardio three or four times a week can’t be a bad idea.

#### 2. Double-veg

Another simple one: whenever I have fruit or vegetables, have twice as much.
I like fruit and vegetables, and it’s really only habit which stops me from
eating more of them.

#### 3. Write more.

This is your classic poorly-planned, doomed-to-fail resolution. There is no
plan here, no list of steps, no schedule, just a vague intention to “write
more”. 

Nothing specific, not a novel or poems or a book on the history of quick
breads, but more little things: more book reviews on Goodreads, more blog
posts, more letters to family, more entries in my journal.

Needless to say, this one needs more work. I don’t want to give it up,
though.
