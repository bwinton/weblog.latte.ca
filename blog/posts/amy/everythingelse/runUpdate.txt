My knee is better.  On my chiropractor's* advice I went to see
a podiatrist to see if I have any functional problems with my
feet, and he didn't find anything.  He thought it was a
"weekend warrior" injury, which I find curiously flattering
since no-one has ever accused me of being in any way 
warrior-like before.  I think he's right, I just overdid it;
not only was I wearing the wrong shoes, but I was also trying
to run like a real runner when at this stage I should be
doing the old-lady-shuffle to get my body used to this
unprecedented level of physical activity.
</p><p>
I resumed running a couple of weeks ago, but I only managed
to go out a couple of times before we decided to switch
our evening routine around, which left me without a good
time to go out.  Blake and I talked about it, and finally
decided that the only time I can go is after dinner.  I was
reluctant to go out after a meal, but there is no other 
good option, as I will discuss in another post (if I have
time).  And it will encourage me to eat a lighter dinner,
which I could certainly stand to do.

Last night I went for my first postprandial run and it was
great.  I didn't really want to go &mdash; it is against my nature
to leave the house after seven at night &mdash; but
go I did.  I ran on the Beltline, an old rail track nearby which
has been converted into a trail, again on my chiro's 
recommendation because it's softer and easier on the 
joints than pavement.  I thought it would be boring
running the Beltline all the time, but I really enjoy
all the people I see; couples with little kids going
out for a walk after dinner; fat people like me trying
to get fit; trim, middle-aged rich women walking briskly
in pairs or groups; serious runners with expensive
gear; groups of teenagers on bikes; people out walking 
their dogs.  Yesterday I saw an old lady out for a
fitness walk wearing white shorts and a t-shirt, 
thin putty-coloured ankle socks and 
<a href="http://www.shoes.com/productimages/shoes_ib49552.jpg">plimsoll 
runners</a>, and no bra.  And I thought I would be
bored!
</p><p>
I am still doing two minutes of walking and one minute
of running, which is how they start you off in the
Running Room clinic.  When I got home last night I realized
it had been a pretty easy run, so next time I will step
it up to one-and-one.

* While my chiropractor is technically a chiropractor, the
care she gives me is mainly something called 
<a href="http://www.activerelease.com/about.asp">Active
Release Techniques</a> which is basically very targeted
massage with movement, designed to loosen tight muscles
and break down scarring.  Since pretty much all my 
physical problems stem from tight muscles in my legs and
butt it works really well
for me.  I say this because I don't want you to think
I am dumb enough to go to a chiropractor for a sore
knee &mdash; I would no more do that than go to an opthamologist
for a sore elbow.
