Okay, I guess I just kind of sprung that on you.  Yeah, I'm pregnant.
I did announce it <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/baby/pregnant.html">a
while ago</a> but then I hid the announcement until I had a chance
to tell the family, and then I was so sick and miserable I haven't 
updated in weeks.  Months?  A long time.
</p><p>
So to recap, pregnant, due in September, I'm not saying exactly when
because people made my life so MISERABLE last time when I was late.
No, I'm not saying exactly when to real-life people either; the only
ones who know are me, Blake and the midwives.
</p><p>
In other news, between the three of us we have suffered the following 
diseases since I last posted:  cold, cold, sinus infection, food poisoning,
food poisoning, ear infection, non-specific sore throat and coughing.  
That in addition to the constant low-grade nausea and crippling fatigue 
of being first-trimester.
</p><p>
At the moment all I can do is look forward to spring, when it will warm
up and all the germs will go away and I will enter my second trimester
and be filled with great, unreasonable energy and optimism.
