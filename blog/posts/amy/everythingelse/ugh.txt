I just got my period.  My first period since July 2002.
</p><p>
And it's appalling.  It's revolting.  It's disgusting.  Why do we
put up with this shit?  It's like Nature herself is conspiring to
oppress and humiliate women.

And to add insult to injury when I picked up my Keeper I realized
that in the last two years it has degraded (it's natural rubber)
so I'm stuck using the huge pads left over from after Delphine's
birth until the drugstore opens and I can buy some tampons.
