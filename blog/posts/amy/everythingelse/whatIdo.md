That last post got me thinking about what I do. Is this
interesting to anyone else? I don't know.

#### At Home

- cook
- clean
- laundry
- read to and play with the girls
- read
- watch TV
- write
- play on the Internet: mainly read blogs, Twitter
- sleep
- garden
- hang out with friends

### Out and About

- take girls to school and other activities
- choir
- run
- grocery shopping and other errands
- PTA meetings
- book club meetings
- visit friends

That's it, apart from occasional major chores like painting, 
and occasional events like weddings and parties.  Seems like a pretty 
simple life, which is the way I like it. Otherwise I get
confused.
