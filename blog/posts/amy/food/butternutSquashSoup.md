Here's a recipe I typed in for a friend yesterday. It's not really a
recipe, just something I throw together. Those are always the hardest
to write down.

#### Ingredients

1 butternut squash (or any other squash, probably, except spaghetti)<br />
some butter<br />
some oil, probably not olive<br />
1 onion (or more) - chopped<br />
cumin, cinnamon, nutmeg maybe?<br />
black pepper<br />
chicken broth<br />
cream<br />
sour cream<br />
crusty bread and more butter<br />

#### Instructions

1. Peel the squash. Yes, really, just with a regular vegetable 
peeler. Then cut it in half and scoop out the seeds. Cut it 
into 1 inch blocks (about) and set aside. Chop the onions.

2. Warm the butter and oil over medium heat and add the 
onions and some salt. Saute until the onions are soft and 
translucent. You could brown them a little bit if you like.

3. Stir some cumin and black pepper and maybe cinnamon *or* 
nutmeg (not both) into the onion and cook it a little bit until 
the kitchen smells really good.

4. Add the cut-up squash and enough chicken broth to cover 
everything plus maybe an inch. Bring it to a boil and simmer 
for twenty minutes or so until the squash is soft.

5. Take it off the heat and blend everything with your hand 
blender. If it's too thick add some more broth. Add a splash 
of cream &mdash; maybe half a cup &mdash; and stir it in. Put it back on 
the heat for a while to warm it up again if you like, but 
don't let it boil.

6. Serve with a dollop of sour cream and lots of crusty bread 
with butter. And maybe a nice light ale.

Enjoy!
