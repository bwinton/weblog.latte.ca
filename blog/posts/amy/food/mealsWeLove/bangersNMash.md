Yesterday's meal was Cordelia's "favourite meal ever! Can you make this
*every day*!?"

- sausages - we had lean turkey sausages, which the children declared they
  didn't love. "They're not very juicy."
- mashed potatoes mashed with plain yogurt
- frozen peas and corn (I was running out of time!)

Simple and popular.
