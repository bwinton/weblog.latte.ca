Delphine has gotten to be pretty picky at the dinner
table, and after one too many "I hate this!"es, Blake
and I decided to let Delphine pick every dinner this
week. Blake walked her through picking things that
are on sale, and he also advised her on the standard
protein-vegetable-starch distribution of a meal.

So this is what we're having this week. Try and guess
which words Delphine wrote and which were Blake's (Blake
likes Random Capitalization and Punctuation):

- Mashed Potatoes & Hot Dogs AND (charred) ESPARAGIS
- Pizza with Pepperoni & Tomato
- Chicken Sandwiches & cut up apples & Corn on the cob.
- Burritos (Beans, tomato, cooked carrots, cheese)
- SRINP ring AND GRILD cheese SANWICHES BOK CHOY???

Should be a tasty week.
