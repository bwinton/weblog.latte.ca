It's Thursday morning, which means no-one has to go
anywhere until Delphine's school starts in the 
afternoon.  This is good news because it's minus
ninety-five outside and I don't want to go out, 
but it's bad news because the girls have to 
negotiate each others' company all morning.

This morning they were doing Arts and Crafts.  Delphine 
is miffed because there's an Arts and Crafts afterschool
program and I didn't sign her up for it, but
fortunately she's pretty sensible so she
deals with it by doing Arts and Crafts (you 
can hear the capitals when she says it) on the
dining room table with Cordelia.  This goes well
for a while until Cordelia doesn't comply with
some requirement of Delphine's and the yelling 
begins.  Delphine is quite bossy: "You have
to draw a face on this person or I won't make
you another person!" 

Cordelia is very stubborn: "I don't want to 
draw a face!"  Except Cordelia's
voice is very high and loud, and she isn't so 
good with consonants, so it's more like "I
DON WAN DRA FAY!"  Which is enough to get anyone's
ire up, and Delphine has a short temper as it
is, so Delphine crumples up whatever it was that
needed a face and declares that she doesn't want
to play any more.

I point out that if they don't want to play together
they each have their own bedroom, so Delphine goes
upstairs.  Cordelia starts to follow her.  "Don't
follow me!  I don't want you!"  Delphine slams her
door.  Cordelia tries to open the door and then
yells "I can't open the door!"  Well, "I CAN' OPE'
THDAH!"

I yell up "If Delphine has her door closed she can
have some privacy!" and Cordelia starts up with her
heart-rending sobs.  When this kid cries she puts
everything into it and you'd have to be made of 
granite to not feel bad.  She collapses on Delphine's
door.  "I love you Delphine!", she wails.

And then the door opens.  "I love you too, Cordelia."
And they hug, and now they're making worlds out of
buttons and Lego and cotton balls.

Friends, enemies, friends, enemies.  I think the
only thing harder than parenting sisters is being
one.
