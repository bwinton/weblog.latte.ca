Okay, I promise that I’m not going to keep on posting more and more
pictures every day, if only because I don’t think I could take 14 good
pictures on the 14th day…  But today there were really three things I
wanted to point out.  The first is the view from the back door out
into the garden.  That’s pretty much how it’ll look every time I walk
out there.  Well, with a top on it, and planters and a garbage box and
a barbeque, and stuff, but that’s the layout.<br clear="left"/>

The next shot is how it will look coming in to the house (if you’re
really small, like Cordelia).  Amy noticed that our house looks a
little ramshackle, with the door all boarded up and stuff.  (Cory (see
<a href="/amy/houseandhome/reno/deck/july16.html">the previous
entry</a>) was nice enough to screw a few boards in so that the girls
didn’t fall out.)<br clear="left"/>

And finally, the shot from Delphine’s room, where you can see the
full-width stairs down the back (on the top of the picture); the
cut-out for the stairs on the side; and, uh, well I guess that’s all
you can see, but on top of the cut-out will be one of the planters,
wiht a matching planter on the other side; underneath the cut-out will
be the garbage-box-thing; on the lower left will be the barbeque, and
the upper half will have a table and chairs for lounging.<br/><br/>
There’s also a nice amount of space on the right for my bicycle, so I
guess I should figure out a way to make that area a little smoother
and nicer to bike or walk on.<br clear="all"/>
