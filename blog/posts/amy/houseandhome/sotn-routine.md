### Part I: Our Routine

It's the middle of January, and January sucks.  It goes on and
on forever and ever, and it's bloody fracking cold this year.
I mean really cold, and I'm tired of it.  I know it gets cold and
it snows every year - this is Canada - but I hate it.  I hate the
bundling up and the having to hurry everywhere outside, but 
mostly I hate the sheer discomfort of being cold.  I am a big
baby.

The girls and I are still doing what I like to call 
*Der grosse Schlep* on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  We take
Cordelia to school for nine, pick her up at 11:30, have lunch
and then take Delphine to school for 12:40.  When Delphine is
at school Cordelia takes a nap, and then we pick Delphine
up at 3:20.  This massive to-ing and fro-ing was supposed to
be a little easier this year because Baba and Zaida bought
a condo halfway between Delphine's school and Cordelia's,
which was to be our waystation and lunch room.  However, the
condo is still (still!) not finished.  I am hoping it will
be done before the end of the school year, but my breath is
not held.

On the other hand Blake's quasi-employed status is proving to
be very helpful.  I can leave Delphine at home while I take
Cordelia to school, and pick her up, and after lunch he puts
Cordelia down for her nap while I take Delphine to school.
This makes for much less putting on and taking off of snowsuits,
and of course I can travel much faster alone.  Hopefully by
the time he gets back to work, snowsuit season will be over.

Apart from the main schedule, which revolves around school,
we have some other stuff going on too.  In the fall both 
girls had gymnastics, and now we're in Music Together on
Saturday mornings.  (In order to keep our schedule manageable
we do an annual rotation of activities: gymnastics in the 
fall, music in winter, swimming in spring.)  Delphine also
has Sparks on Wednesday evenings at 5:30, which let me say
is an insanely bad time for an activity.  We have to leave at
5:15 and we're not home until 6:45, which (when bedtime is
at 7:00 is far too late for dinner.)

The other regular rhythm to our life is that after school
the girls watch two (2) TV shows.  I was pretty hardline on the
TV thing for a long time, but an essay in that Alfie Kohn
book convinced me that TV isn't inherently evil, and 
Delphine's getting to the age where TV is a significant
part of her peer culture.  And Blake and I watch and 
enjoy our TV shows - I try not to be too much of a hypocrite.

That's our routine these days.  It's going to be like this
until the end of the school year, and then next year life
will be significantly easier because Cordelia will be
in JK at the same school as Delphine.  Hooray!
