About a week and a half ago our <a href="http://www.ajmadison.com/cgi-bin/ajmadison/LHW0050PQ.html">cheap little washing machine</a> 
 started making an alarming grindy
noise when it was draining, and then the day before Blake left on
business it decided it wasn't going to drain at all; the clothes were
left to wallow in a puddle of soapy water at the end of the load. 

There's a drain outlet with a filter on the front of the machine which catches
little bits of crap you've left in your pockets, fluff and soapy slime; we
opened that and a whole wash-load of water flooded out. Fortunately 
the washer lives in our unfinished basement right by a drain, so the water
found a good home without destroying anything on the way. The filter had
caught a whole lot of safety pins, beads and bobby pins (damn you, ballet);
I guess they mean it when they say you have to clear it out every month.

I did some Googling and found some suggestions, some <a href="http://forum.appliancepartspros.com/washer-repair/260509-compact-washer-wont-drain.html">helpful</a>
and some <a href="http://forum.appliancepartspros.com/washer-repair/69871-whirlpool-wont-spin.html">not so helpful</a>. From our information, we deduced
that the problem was somewhere in the <a href="http://www.partselect.ca/ModelFrames.aspx?ModelID=699075&ModelNum=lhw0050pq4&mfgModelNum=&ManufactureID=3&Selected=JPKVCKPK&Position=5&mfg=Whirlpool&Type=&Mark=5">pump and drain system</a> 
(we're brilliant). 

So we headed downstairs and starting taking the thing apart; we removed
the back panel, disconnected all the bits of drain pipe we could make sense of,
and failed to find any obvious blockages or other visible problems. That left
the pump, which looked okay, but then that's the nature of pumps. Having
eliminated everything else, we ordered <a
href="http://www.partselect.ca/PS972050-Whirlpool-8182415-Washer-Water-Pump.htm?SourceCode=1&SearchTerm=lhw0050pq4&ModelNum=lhw0050pq4">a
new pump</a>.

It arrived a couple of days later (I love 
<a href="http://www.partselect.ca">PartSelect</a>) but Blake was away
and I didn't fancy trying to screw the pump to the bottom of the machine
without someone to hold it up. So I waited until he got home, and we installed
the new pump today. It was tricky and a bit annoying, but not 
spend-my-debt-paying-money-for-someone-else-to-do-it tricky.

And guess what? It works! The machine is purring happily away, draining
like never before, and Blake and I are full of the smug satisfaction
that comes from fixing something yourself instead of being suckers and paying
someone to unscrew some screws and disconnect some hoses.

The next thing, of course, is to fix the stove...
