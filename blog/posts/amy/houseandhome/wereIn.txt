We made it in, and back on the internet in record time (after the
cable dude drilled a hole in our wall.  All the way through our wall.
With a really long drill bit.)
</p><p>
Moving day went pretty smoothly, all in all.   It took way longer than
I thought it would to move us over; we have a lot of stuff, which is
funny because I hate stuff.  I guess I don't hate it all that much.
We weren't all moved until seven at night, and then we had a minor
crisis because I wasn't smart enough to set aside pyjamas and toothbrushes
and stuff, so we had to go digging through boxes before the girls 
could go to be.  In fact they both went to bed in regular clothes
because I gave up on their pyjamas.
</p><p>
Today Blake and I and Morgan worked hard building furniture and
unpacking, and the place
still looks like hell but we did manage to sit on our actual sofa
and watch some actual TV this evening, and isn't that what it's all
about?  
</p><p>
Tomorrow the plumber comes to install our 
<a href="http://www.clawfootsupply.com/product463">shower converter thing</a>
(not that exact one but something similar) and our 
<a href="http://www.clawfootsupply.com/product906">super sexy
bridge faucet</a> (that exact one, I believe, although we didn't buy
it from that supplier).  Also the couch dudes come back to reassemble
the huge couch in Cordelia's room, and then I think that's all for
people coming to fix stuff.  For a while, anyway.
</p><p>
I kind of love my little house.  I knew I would.  It seems to be
holding all our stuff fairly well, even without buying new furniture
and installing clever storage solutions and, you know, adding fifteen 
feet to the back.  Although I am still trying to figure
out how previous owners have managed without any kind of coat
closet.  I love the Deco fixtures, I love how it gets warm really
quickly and stays that way (because it doesn't have a wall of
eight-foot windows in every room), I love the neighbours, I love
having rooms for the girls. 
</p><p>
We are still getting used to the new noises. The floors upstairs
are so creaky that our ten pound cat sets them off;  last night
poor Blake kept getting up because he thought Delphine was coming
down the hall, but no, it was just Thomas.  Tonight Blake and
I spent some time figuring out the source of a weird pinging noise;
turns out a floor joist in the dining room is attached to a duct,
and every time you step in it it flexes the duct enough to make
it ping.  And now we think we can hear the neighbour's television.
</p><p>
Tomorrow is Monday; Blake is off work and Delphine is in daycare,
so hopefully we can get a good pile of stuff done.  Hooray!
