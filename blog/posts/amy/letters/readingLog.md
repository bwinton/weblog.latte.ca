Here's a letter I wrote to Delphine's teacher about the daily reading log
he has asked us to have the children fill out &mdash; the children are supposed
to read for fifteen minutes a day, and the parents are expected to
initial the log on a daily basis.

<blockquote>
<p style="padding-top:10px;">
Mr. F&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p style="padding-top:10px;">
Delphine has not been filling in her reading log. I admit I haven't been
encouraging her to -- I want her to read for as long as she wants to for
pleasure and knowledge, not to a clock because she's been told to. Delphine is
a born reader and we have no problem getting her to read or to challenge
herself.
</p>
<p style="padding-top:10px;">
I can assure you with a great deal of confidence that she has read for at least
fifteen minutes every day this September, and indeed probably every day since
she learned to read four years ago. I can also assure you, with almost the same
degree of confidence, that she will read for at least fifteen minutes a day for
the rest of the school year. I'm so confident of that that I would happily
pre-initial a year's worth of reading logs right now. However, I expect that
would defeat any other purposes of the reading log that you have in mind.
</p>
<p style="padding-top:10px;">
If the reading log serves to give you some idea of what students are reading,
would it be acceptable for Delphine to provide you a list of what she has read?
She's also willing to write a report on what she's read once a month or at some
other frequency if that would be helpful.
</p>
<p style="padding-top:10px;">
Let me know if you'd like to discuss this in person -- I'm available before and
after school most days.

Hopefully he will respond favourably. I think the only eventuality I didn't
cover in the above letter is that he wants the kids to fill in the reading log
because he wants them to get used to doing bullshit paperwork. This is a
defense which comes up frequently when this matter is under debate. "They're
going to have to do mindless busywork at some point, better get them used to
it!" I don't buy it. They're all going to have to, say, wear glasses at some
point (unless they die before middle age), but no-one advocates making all
children wear glasses. 

And it's not like doing bullshit paperwork is a sophisticated skill you have
to start working on in childhood, like playing classical piano or doing
gymnastics. You can pretty much pick it up in half an hour.

Anyway, Mr. F&mdash;&mdash; strikes me as an intelligent and thoughtful 
teacher, so I don't think he's going to go for the bullshit paperwork angle.
We'll see how it turns out.
