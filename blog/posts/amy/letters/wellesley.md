Sometimes I write letters about stuff that isn't very important
in the grand scheme of things.  I sent this to the nice folks
at [Wellesley](http://www.wellappleproducts.com/):

> Hi,
> 
> I just wanted to let you know how much I love your apple butter!
> I am from rural Saskatchewan and some of my neighbours made
> apple butter when I was a kid, so I was excited to see it on the
> shelf at my grocery store.  I was even more excited when I
> tasted it - I don't remember my neighbours' apple butter
> being so sublime!  You have definitely figured out the
> perfect recipe.

> Wellesley Apple Butter is now my gift for people who are
> visiting, or for when I go away -- maple syrup is such a
> cliche, but apple butter is perfectly local and evocative of
> Southern Ontario.  You make it easy to eat locally!

> Congratulations!
