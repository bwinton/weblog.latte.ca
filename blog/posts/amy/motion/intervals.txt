This post started as a response to Jillian's comment in my last post;
my response started getting really long so I figured I would post it
instead.
</p><p>
Here's what Jill said:

<blockquote>
<p>Fives and ones. I am in awe. I'm still doing twos and ones. 
Although perhaps that's because I live in the boonies and drive everywhere.
</p><p>
Someday I'll get an interval timer so I don't have to look at 
my watch every three steps. That might speed me up a little.</p>

Hey, two and ones are better than, say, the none and nones I was 
doing before this!  I have been increasing my running time every 
week or so fairly religiously.  I talked with Blake about it and he 
agreed that there's no point in waiting until one time becomes 
"easy" before moving up.  I mean, I guess it gets easi<em>er</em>
but never what I would call easy.  But then somehow the next step
up isn't all that much harder, and lo and behold here I am at
five and ones without ever feeling that I have over-exerted myself.
It's kind of weird, really.
</p><p>
Having a good timer must help a lot.  I am going to buy myself 
one of those cute little pink and purple Timex running watches as a 
reward for completing the 5K, I think (with my Running Room clinic 
coupon).  Right now I am using a hundred-year-old watch borrowed 
from Blake which only does one interval per set, so if I want to 
do five and ones I set it for six minutes, watch it obsessively 
for the first minute while I walk, and then run until it beeps.  
It does the trick for now, but it is neither pink and purple nor
cute.

Some opportunistic bacteria have taken advantage of my allergically 
stuffed-up sinuses and set up residence there so now I have added sore teeth
and joint pain and general all-over misery to my existing repertoire
of sneezing and stuffiness, ironically just in time for the ragweed
pollen count to go down.  What this has to do with running is that
I skipped my run last night, which wouldn't be so bad except I 
skipped my run on Sunday too, due to being lazy and full after a
big family dinner.  So now I have skipped two runs in a row and I
am beginning to get annoyed with myself.  I should really have gone
out on Sunday; perhaps even eaten less so I wouldn't have been
so lethargic!  Now there's an idea.

I was having a look at the 
<a href="http://www.torontowaterfrontmarathon.com/en/images/stwmmarmap_big.jpg">map</a>
for the marathon I am not running on the 24th.  Notice how the 5K isn't
even shown on the map?  That's because the resolution of the map isn't
high enough to show the itty-bitty 5K route.  Damn, marathons are 
<em>long</em>!
I know, news at eleven, but look at that thing!  These people are running
all the way out to the Beaches, oh, but that's not far enough so on the way,
let's run <em>all the way down Leslie Spit</em> and back, and oh hey, that's
<em>still</em> not far enough, we have to double back all the way through 
downtown, past Roncesvalles, past High Park, to.. I don't even
know where that is!  Etobicoke?  Someplace I never go!  AND THEN
BACK DOWNTOWN!

Marathons are long, dude.
