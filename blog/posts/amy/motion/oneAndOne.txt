Tonight I did my first one-and-one &mdash; one minute of
running for each minute of walking &mdash; since my knee
injury healed.  (Previously I was doing two minute of
walking to every minute of running, so on average you
could hardly call it "running" at all.)  
It went pretty well, considering it was
thirty-two degrees with a Humidex of thirty-nine.  My 
knee was hurting a little bit, but I babied it and I'll
ice it tonight if I remember.
</p><p>
I noticed I'm not getting terribly out of breath on 
these runs, probably because I am running really slow.
I breath fast, but it's not that desperate, panting,
bile-taste-at-the-back-of-my-throat breathing I remember
so well from phys ed.  Ahh, phys ed.

Incidentally, my friend Michelle, who was my real-life
inspiration to start running, is training for her first
half-marathon, and is documenting the whole gory process
on her 
<a href="http://30somethingrunner.blogspot.com/">running
blog</a>.  Michelle is in my choir, and we got to be
friends because she laughs at my smartass comments.
(Laughing at my jokes is a very short path to my heart.)
</p><p>
When I found out she runs I was a little surprised, 
because I always thought runners were kind of...
different.  Athletic.  Jockish.  That runners were
perhaps some entirely different species that I could
never fully relate to.  Since I was pretty sure that Michelle
is my kind of people, I had to reconsider my perspective
on runners, which made it possible for me to seriously
consider running myself.  And here I am, with Michelle
cheering me on.
