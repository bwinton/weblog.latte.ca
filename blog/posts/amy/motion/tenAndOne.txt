On Saturday I did a surprisingly easy 5K of ten and ones &mdash;
surprising because I ran exactly  no times the week before.  I 
guess some rest is what the doctor ordered.

Last night I went out in the drizzle and did another 2.5K of
ten and ones, and I thought about why I like running outside 
rather than in a treadmill: every time you go out, it's a 
new run, even if you are running the same old route.  Running
in rain is different from running in sun, is different from
running in snow is different from running three days after
it snows.  Running uphill is different from running downhill,
running on gravel is different from running on pavement is
different from running on asphalt.

When you run on a treadmill the best you can hope for is that
the Seinfeld repeat is one you haven't seen lately.
