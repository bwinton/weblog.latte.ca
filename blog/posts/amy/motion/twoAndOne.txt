I'm into two and ones, two minutes of running and one
minute of walking.  I've been for two runs at that pace
and they have been hard but not impossible.  I had to
consciously slow myself down so that I would be able
to get through the two minutes a couple of times, and
some of those one minute breaks seemed pretty short,
but I've managed.  I think I will do another couple of
runs at this pace before I move to three-and-ones; so
far I have only done two-and-one in the blistering 
heat and humidity, so I am curious to see how they are
in reasonable weather.

Also next weekend my Learn To Run clinic (second
attempt) begins; they will start back at one-and-twos
so I will be in great shape for that.
</p><p>
I continue to shock myself with how motivated I am
to run, but I know why.  I usually exercise because
I knew I should exercise, because it's Good For Me.
I don't know what the human aversion is to
doing things just because they're Good For You, but
it definitely exists:  I hated to exercise and would
create all kinds of excuses not to do it.
</p><p>
But running has managed to elude being categorized
as exercise in my brain; somehow it seems to have
slipped into some kind of Hobbies and Activities
category.  I run for the sake of running, not for
the exercise or because it's good for me or to lower
my cholesterol or lose weight.  I run so that I 
can run more, so
that I get better at it, so that I can do a 5K in
September.
</p><p>
So much so, in fact, that when I noticed my shorts
were getting a little looser it took me a while to
think that, yeah, it's probably because of the
running.  I actually thought, surely twenty minutes
of running three times a week wouldn't make that 
much difference.  But I haven't changed anything
else, so that must be it.  (Unless I do have some
wasting disease, which was my first thought.)
