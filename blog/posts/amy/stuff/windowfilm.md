Our house is pretty chilly in winter, and it's quite clear
that one of the weak links is the windows.  You can tell 
from the avalanche of freezing cold air that rolls off the
windows as soon as you open the blinds\*.  So this winter
we decided to try that plastic wrap stuff that you tape
around the windows and then blowdry to tighten it up and 
make it all smooth.  It's kind of ghetto but we can't afford
to replace the windows, so it will have to do, and I was
determined to do it right -- there is a house nearby 
with plastic on the windows and they didn't prep it properly
so the tape has come off and it's hanging down and it 
looks *really* ghetto.

There were two brands at the store, 3M and another brand
from Quebec.  This whole post would be much more useful if
I remembered what the brand of the other stuff was; anyway,
it comes in a blue box and it's from Quebec.  We bought
the two-window kit by 3M and the five-window kit from the 
other company; both kits were about $35, so you can see that
the 3M stuff would have to be much better to be worth the
extra money.

Here were the differences between the two products:

- the 3M stuff had slightly wider double-sided tape, and 
the tape backing had red text printed on it - that doesn't seem
like a big thing but our window frames are white so the white-only
backing on the other tape made it a little harder to find the
end of the tape.  3M advertise that "the difference is in the 
tape", and indeed that's one of the things they are known for,
but apart from the slight difference in width and the backing,
I couldn't perceive a difference in the tape.  Maybe the
other brand will start peeling off in February or something.
- the instructions on the other stuff were more thorough.  At
first Blake interpreted that to mean that the other stuff was
harder to install, but installation was identical for the
two products, it's just that 3M tried to make it sound easy.
- the non-3M film was thinner.  I suppose that would make it
more fragile but I didn't have trouble with it breaking, and
it heat-shrunk better.  I doubt the width of the film makes
much difference to insulation; I expect insulation is mainly
furnished by the air between the window and the film.

So this is what you do:

1. Clean the window frame.  I used a solution of water, dish soap
and vinegar, and a cloth diaper.  (I cleaned the window too
because I'm not going to get at it for a few months.)
Then I wiped it with rubbing alcohol - that's what the
non-3M stuff said to do.
2. Put the tape on the window frame.  After the first couple
of pieces I figured out that you need to peel a couple of
inches off the backing paper before you put the tape up because
it's really hard to start it when it's up on your window.
3. Cut the plastic film to size.  We ended up with lots of 
extra film, but I'm not sure how much extra they give you.
Our windows might just be small.  Anyway, give yourself three
or four extra inches on each side just to be safe.
4. Peel the backing paper off the tape.  This is kind of fun.
5. Adhere the film to the tape.  You can actually stick it on 
fairly gently to start with, and then pull it off, stretch
it and restick it until you have it as tight and smooth
as possible.  Then press it firmly onto the tape once you're
happy with it.
6. This is the fun part: use a blow dryer to heat the plastic
so it shrinks like a giant shrinkydink and pulls all the
remaining wrinkles out.
7. Trim the excess film.  Carefully.  I was very conservative
and left lots of extra because I didn't want to risk puncturing
the film.  Your mileage may vary.
8. Stand back and admire your work.  I'm really happy with how
ours turned out; you can't see it at all from outside, and it's
barely noticable from inside.

It took me about half an hour for each window, and I did it over
a week or so.  Kind of a big production and pain in the ass.
I think it's helping with the cold thing though.  Our big problem
(apart from the aforementioned avalanche of cold) was condensation,
and there's much less of it now, so clearly that cold is being
stopped.  I'm not sure if it's going to save us $70 in utility  bills, 
though.  But we'll probably do it again next year just for
the increased comfort.

Anyway, so that's what I learned about insulating window film.
Hopefully this is helpful to someone somewhere.

\* Incidentally our blinds are awesome.  We have honeycomb blinds
from Hunter Douglas and they block a heck of a lot of cold.  We
saved a bunch on natural gas after we installed them, which is
good because they were about a million dollars.  I expect another
brand of the same product would be equally effective, but
the Hunter Douglas ones are very well made.  I'm happy with them.
(I wish we had got the top-down/bottom-up mechanism on all the
blinds, though; the only window we didn't get it for was the
living room, and sometimes I would like to open just the top
of that, like in the morning in summer when I'm not dressed yet.)
