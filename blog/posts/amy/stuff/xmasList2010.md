Dear Santa,

I know I don't actually believe in you, and no-one buys me Christmas gifts
except my mother who doesn't have Internet access, and my husband who
refuses to buy me anything I ask for on account of "it wouldn't be
a surprise". But I'm putting this up here anyway. Just in case.

* I've always wanted a name necklace, and I especially like 
<a href="http://mynamenecklace.com/Product.aspx?p=2324&amp;m=334">this red
acrylic one</a>.
* Electric pencil sharpener. I know it's not eco. I just want one.
* Squirrel-proof bird feeder
* Jo Malone perfume. You choose the fragrance. (Scented lotion would be 
fine too.)
* Votive candles. Now that the children are old enough to not do anything
stupid, I've rediscovered candles. I like the expensive ones with
good quality fragrances.
* <a href="http://www.staples.ca/ENG/Catalog/cat_sku.asp?CatIds=&amp;webid=569444&amp;affixedcode=WW">24-pack ultra-fine tip Sharpies</a>. All those lovely colours.
* Quality Street chocolate. Always welcome.
* I'd love a clicky IBM-style keyboard. ThinkGeek 
  <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/keyboards-mice/8396/">has one</a>,
  although I'd be just as happy with one with labelled keys.

Thanks in advance, Santa. Remember, I'm the house with the cookies
and *brandy*.

Respectfully yours,<br />
Amy
