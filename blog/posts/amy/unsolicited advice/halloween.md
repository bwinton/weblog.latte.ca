Our school website contains a list of handy Hallowe'en
safety tips, among them the old chestnut about
inspecting kids' candy before they eat it.  I suppose that wouldn't 
hurt, but it might be interesting to know that there
has never been a case of random poisoned 
Hallowe'en candy.  There have been a few
reports of candy with pins, and apples with
razors, but the vast majority of those were hoaxes
or pranks.

Here are a couple of links from the valuable 
Snopes website:

- [On poisoning](http://www.snopes.com/horrors/poison/halloween.asp)
- [On needles and razors](http://www.snopes.com/horrors/mayhem/needles.asp)

Perhaps it seems harmless to continue repeating
these needless warnings, but I think it breeds 
cynicism and fear, which we have far too 
much of.  (Don't even get me started on "Stranger
Danger".)

(I'm going to have to think further about the appropriateness
of cynicism and/or fear with respect to Chinese
candy.)
