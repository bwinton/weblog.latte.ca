I have this friend who just had a baby, and I am about busting
with advice that she does not want.  But!  There is so much I
have learned about babies!  I want to share!
</p><p>
So I will non-agressively put what I have learned here so she
can take my advice or not without giving offence, and also so it's available for
anyone else who wants it.
</p><p>
Of course I don't suggest that all of this advice will work
for everyone, but some of it will work for someone, and I
think the more we all talk about how we handle this parenting 
thing the better off we will be.  (To that end you should go
read <a href="http://smartypants.diaryland.com/">Mimi
Smartypants</a> and <a href="http://www.dooce.com/">Dooce</a>.)

Your baby is going sleep most of the time, but after she's a
couple of weeks old she'll be awake sometimes too.  Most of the time
you'll be feeding her and changing her diaper, but sometimes 
you're going to want to put her down.  Get a <strong>high
chair</strong>.  One that reclines a lot so you can put a 
newborn in it.  We have an Evenflo Simplicity Easy-fold which 
I am very happy with.  Cordelia sits in it and hangs out while
I'm cooking or typing or whatever.  Also it has wheels on it
so I can wheel her around the condo with me.  (You're not
supposed to wheel it around with the baby in it, but whatever.)
And I tip it all the way back and put a blanket on her and
a soother in her mouth, and bang, she's asleep.  (I think
the way the chair surrounds her is more comforting than lying
flat on her back in the crib -- she's only four months out of the
womb, after all.)  It's her one-stop captain's chair.
</p><p>
Interestingly I haven't heard this advice anywhere else -- where
do other people put their babies when they're awake?  Alone in
their crib?  In a bouncy chair so all they can see is knees?
Flat on their back in a playpen to look at the ceiling?  I don't
know.
</p><p>
Okay, that's all for now because Cordelia is howling (in her
high chair -- it doesn't work miracles!).
