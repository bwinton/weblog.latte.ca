Yesterday I got into a TwitFight. Not even a fight: There's
this guy on Twitter who posts the same advice every day. Literally,
the exact same Twit, every day. It's a "daily reminder". I
said to him, in a lighthearted way, that I would stop following 
him if he Twitted that again. One thing led to another and I
said I thought it was presumptuous to give out the same advice
every day (actually I said he was nagging), and he said it 
was presumptuous of me to assume he cares. Whatever. Tiny 
little disagreement about something of negligible importance 
with someone I don't know who means nothing to me.

How did I respond to this disagreement? Did I transfer my 
attention to something worthy of my time, maybe one of the
blogs I enjoy, or perhaps my children? My friends? No.
I let it get to me: my heart rate went up, I got nervous and
twitchy, I couldn't stop thinking about it.  I tried to talk
myself down, to get some perspective, to distract myself,
but my mind kept wandering back to the disagreement. I couldn't
stop thinking about it: was I wrong? Was the guy right? Should
I respond back to him? Would my friends back me up? Why was
he being a dick about it? *Was* he being a dick about it? Why
would he think that people want to read the same piece of advice
every day anyway? Should
I not have said anything? The thoughts kept buzzing around, 
almost beyond my control.

It's not just this time. The same thing happens whenever I get into
an altercation with anyone. It's been happening when I 
get into fights on the Internet
as long as I've been on the Internet, and it happens in
real life too, on the rare occasion when I have the balls
to disagree with someone who is within arm's reach. Any
fight, no matter how minor, results in hours of analysis
and worrying and anxiety. 

I can't bear conflict.  I don't like 
people to disagree with me; when they do, I get defensive,
I get nervous, I second-guess myself. I try and get my
friends to take my side, or at least I reassure myself that
they would. I forget that I'm an
intelligent person who is entitled to disagree with others.
I forget that I don't need a bunch of people backing me up to be
right. I have a brain, I can have an opinion without taking a
poll of all my friends first. 

Why do I have such a strong physical and emotional
reaction when I get into an argument with someone? Is it
just lack of practice? Is it some relic from my childhood?
Perhaps the more important question is, how do I get
over it? Maybe I need to pick more fights so that I 
learn to deal better.
