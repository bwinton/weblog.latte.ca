Cordelia and I are sick.  According to the
[Venn diagram of misery](http://www.latte.ca/pics/2006/0420/11-w-symptoms.jpg)
I have either a cold with muscle pain, fever and headache,
or a flu with sneezing and runny nose.  Maybe I have
a cold and flu simultaneously!  Whatever I have it's 
mild enough to allow me to get up and make myself
useful while still being severe enough to make me
miserable.

I kept Cordelia home from school today because she
woke up during the night all hot and coughing, but
now that she's awake she seems more or less fine.
I'm sure she will hit a brick wall sooner or later.
Hopefully I can get someone to pick Delphine up from
school so Cordelia can have a nice long nap.

Now I'm going to set the children up with the obligatory
Sick Day TV.
