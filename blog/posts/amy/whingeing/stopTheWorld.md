Life is coming at me too fast lately. 

We're still in the middle of the
bathroom reno (basement powder room is done, upstairs bathroom is 
entirely non-functional).  This means I have to find somewhere else to 
shower.

I just helped publish a <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/">book</a>, which is
really cool but the work keeps coming; we have a print edition, but we also
want to produce various different eBooks (and the giant learning curve that
entails), not to mention fixing errata and keeping the website up to date.

The girls' school spring fair is this weekend, which means I will be
baking for the bake sale tomorrow, and both Blake and I are volunteering
on the day of.

Delphine has had a persistent infestation of lice, for almost two weeks.  We've
treated with the chemical agent and picked nits for hours, but that didn't do
the trick so I treated her again today with some herbal stuff of dubious value
and spent another hour or so picking nits.

My brother is getting married in July, which is going to be completely
awesome, but I've never been to Japan before and I have a ton of things
to do, get, and read about before I go.

Then there's the usual groceries, laundry, cooking, picking up and
dropping off, vacuuming, etc, etc.

And, finally, inevitably, I just scratched my head and came away with a live
louse.  So now I'm off to shave my head. Or something.
