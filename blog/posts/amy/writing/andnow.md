Here's how I feel: I'm nervous. I'm embarrassed. I'm insecure.
I'm excited.

Here's why: I'm going to be a writer.

***

I feel so stupid typing that. I was tempted to say, "I'm going to
start a writing career", or "I'm going to try writing for money",
but those are just mealy-mouthed ways of saying, "I'm going
to be a writer." Why not go for the gusto?

I'm nervous because what if it doesn't work out? What if it turns
out no-one wants to pay me to write? (Answer: I'll just keep trying.
Sooner or later *somebody* will pay me to write *something*.)

I'm embarrassed because it seems so presumptuous to be
all, "I'm going to be a writer!" because what makes me so special?
Then mad at
myself for not thinking I'm special enough to be a writer.
(As if being a writer is some kind of impossibly cool and unlikely
job, like being a rock star. I have this idea that if a 
job is cool enough for me
to want to do it, automatically I am not cool enough to do said
job. Before now I've only ever seriously considered jobs that 
I secretly think are kind of lame. Or at least very safe.)

Insecure, obviously. Very. The little voices in my head which
tell me I can't do stuff are having a field day with this one.

And excited, too, when I manage to squeeze it in amongst all
that other nonsense.

I'm not sure when I'm going to fit Being A Writer in amongst
all the other stuff, but the plus side is I can do it without
having to add much: I have a computer, an Internet connection,
a phone and a roof. I also have two hours every day. At some
point I would like to add a computer of my very own (rather
than the shared family computer) and maybe a writing course
or two, but Blake looks askance at spending any money on this
endeavour before I've "proven" that I can earn money at it. (Which I
take, of course, to be a vote of non-confidence, even though
it's actually perfectly sensible.)

I'm going to kick it all off by working on three projects (yes, three):
a non-fiction children's book or article, an article (subject TBD) in a
parenting magazine (which one TBD), and an article on science
and society in, again, some unspecified publication. I know, this
all seems insanely vague, but this whole "let's be a writer!"
thing is still insanely vague. I just decided to pick three things
I would like to write, so I would have something concrete to work
towards. My first tasks for all three pieces are basically: "research
publishers" and "research topics". Once I have been working on
those for a few weeks I will also start sending out feelers for
business writing gigs, which I expect will be my bread and butter.
I'm not so choosy about what I write, I just love the idea of
getting paid for it.

So there. I said it. Out loud. My writing alter-ego is 
@arbrownwriter at Twitter and arbrownwriter at gmail.  Drop me
a line if you need me to write something for you!
