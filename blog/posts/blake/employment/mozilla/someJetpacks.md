There have been a couple of things I’ve noticed myself doing over and over
again recently, and because I’m a developer whenever I do something over
and over again, I try to find a way to automate it.

So I did some playing around with Mozilla’s [Add-on Builder](
https://builder.mozillalabs.com/) and came up with [a couple of Jetpacks](
http://bwinton.latte.ca/Work/jetpacks/) that solved my problems.  Maybe
you’ll find them useful, too.
