<p>From various places around the net.  (Hint: Google "vss to subversion".)
<ul>
  <li><a
href="http://tortoisesvn.sourceforge.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/ch05s18.html"
    >Lock-modify-unlock for Svn.</a>  Not that that's what I think we should 
    bd doing, but if I've got to sell it, and that's a sticking point, at least
    I have an answer now.</li>
  <li>Subversion is said to be much faster.  "Our CC.NET build went from 3
    minutes to 35 seconds for whole tree!!!!"  I haven't looked up how much of
    our nightly build time is spent getting files from VSS, but I seem to
    remember it's not inconsiderable, and that step has been failing more often 
    recently, so if we can make it both faster and more reliable, that'll be a 
    good selling point.</li>
  <li><a href="http://ankhsvn.tigris.org/">Ankhsvn</a> (Wow, what a horrible
    front page!  If I were <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/">Greg
    Wilson</a>, and <a 
    href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/645.html">grading them on
    it</a>, they'ld get a 51%.  I mean, it's there, so I'm not going to fail
    you, but for the love of Pete, hire a graphic designer, or look at the other 
    two links in this entry, or something.  Please.) or <a 
    href="http://www.pushok.com/soft_svn.php">PushOK</a> or <a 
    href="http://www.visualsvn.com/">VisualSVN</a> for Visual Studio 
    integration, but everyone seems to use <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSvn</a>.  I
    wonder if there's something similar for OSX?  Fortunately, Eclipse 
    integration is good enough that I don't really mind falling back to the 
    command line client when I have to, but still.</li>
  <li>A <a
href="http://codecorner.tigernews.co.uk/codecorner/presentations/ddd2-subversion.zip"
    >presentation</a> on "Replacing SourceSafe with SubVersion".</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.pumacode.org/projects/vss2svn">A Perl script</a> 
    (<i>shudder</i>) to migrate your VSS repository to svn.</li>
</ul><br />
And there you go.  Management has been feeling the pain recently, and the Server 
Team Lead seems onboard with the idea, so we might actually make the change.  
Exciting times.
