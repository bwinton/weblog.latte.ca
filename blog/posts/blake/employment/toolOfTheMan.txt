<p>I notice that <a
href="http://crazedmonkey.com/blog/2003/01/22#w0096">Ian
Stevens</a> mentioned an application that the company he works at
recently released.<br />Damn, what a sell-out!  I can't wait to
see what his next announcement will be.</p>
<p><small>Disclaimer: I work with Ian, and he knows that I don't
actually think he's a sell-out.</small></p>
