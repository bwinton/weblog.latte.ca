<p>Amy and Cordelia left for Saskatchewan at 6:30 this morning, and so
Delphine and I got to spend the whole day together.  The first of
seven.  It’s going pretty well so far, I think.  We played together in
the park this morning: digging in the sand, flying kites, and kicking
a soccer ball.  We got home, and had some leftovers for lunch (grilled
cheese and pizza, both heated in the toaster over), then watched the
obligatory Charlie and Lola show, and read some books.  Ooh, we also
had banana/frozen-strawberry/milk smoothies for afternoon snack.  They
were really good, and a convenient way to get some fruit into our
bodies.  After hanging out a little, we went to the grocery store,
grabbed the week’s worth of groceries, and headed home.  So I thought
I’ld take a few minutes to write a quick blog entry while I’m cooking
dinner (frozen President’s Choice vegetable lasagna).</p>

<p>Dinner was tasty, and Delpine liked it, even though she started off
saying “I’ve had this before at daycare, and I don’t like it.”.  Then
we looked for recipes for apple cake, found one, and headed off to
bed.  And now I’m not entirely sure what I’m going to do for the rest
of the evening.  I suppose there’s a FIFA Women’s World Cup game I’ve
got taped, or I could watch a video about Haskell by Simon
Peyton-Jones, but I dunno, neither of those seem to really be grabbing
me.  Ah well, I’m sure I’ll figure something out.</p>
