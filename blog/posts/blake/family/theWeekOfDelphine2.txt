<p>Today seemed a little more in control than yesterday.  I was really
slacking yesterday, doing as little housework as I could possibly
manage.  Today I got a load of laundry done, and hung up in the
basement, and I would be on my second load, but apparently the door
didn’t close, or something, and so the load was completely dry when I
went to check it after dinner.  Dinner was another thing I handled a
little better.  Since my father and sister were coming for dinner, I
made chili from around 3:00 until 4:00, and let it sit on the stove on
low, mellowing.  It turned out really well, I think, and there are some
leftovers.  Delphine and I also made some Rice Krispie Squares that
afternoon (I made them, she licked the various implements), so we had a
fun dessert as well.</p>

<p>I’m really looking forward to tomorrow, though, since I’ll have two
fairly large blocks of free time, in which to attempt to beat the house
into something approaching shape.  The kitchen really needs a cleaning,
there are three more loads of laundry to do.  (Four if you count the
failed attempt in the washing machine.)  In the morning, I’ve got to
make sure that Delphine has all the stuff she needs for kindergarten.
Okay, that’s not actually something I can do in the blocks of free time,
but I figured since I was listing all the stuff I need to get done, I
might as well just slip it in there.  And on that note, I think I’ll be
off to try and get another couple of things done before I head to
bed.</p>
