<p>Ah, the city.  How I love it.  I’ve just gotten back from a trip to
the cottage my parents’ rented, and while the house is sort of lonely
with just me there, I’m really enjoying being able to flush the
toilet, and have a long shower, and run the air conditioning, and all
those other conveniences of modern life.  That’s not to say that I
didn’t enjoy the cottage.  I think I had more fun there this year than
I have since I was a kid, but it is still nice to be home.</p>

<p>I think the main trick will be keeping on top of everything so that
I’m not making a mad rush to get everything done on Sunday morning,
before Amy and the kids get home.  It’ll be an extra-special trick,
since Trevor’s on vacation this week, so I’ll be the lead server
developer for the two products that we’re trying to release in the
next week or so.  Ah, well.  It wouldn’t be fun without some stress,
right?</p>
