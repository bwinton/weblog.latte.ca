<p>As I <a
href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake/random/biking/SoTired.html">mentioned
previously</a>, I'm going to head up to Balm Beach sometime in late
July.  This sort of worried me, since up until now, all my biking was
commuting (8 km one way, 12 km the other), or going on slightly longer
group rides (21 km, but only 13.6 km/h).  None of these tiny rides
would prepare me for a 135 km trek up to Balm Beach.</p>

<p>So I decided to go on one of the <a href="http://www.bikerally.org"
>PWA Bike Rally</a> training rides.  Specifically, the one this
morning, heading up to <a
href="http://www.bikerally.org/trainingmaps2006/87k_KennedyMusselman.pdf"
>Musselman Lake</a>.  It ended up being almost 94 km for me, instead
of the 87 km they claim it will be, but I figure most of that is my
walking my bike onto and off of the TTC.  Even counting those slow
kilometers, though, I still managed to average 23.2 km/h, which is
really quite respectible, I feel, for my first time out.  And yeah, it
totally wasn't a problem.  I mean, I'm quite tired now, but I'm still
up and walking around, and I think I could even have biked home, if I
had to.  Much easier to pay my $2.10 to the TTC, and let them carry
me, though.</p>

<p>What else...  I met a bunch of really friendly people, and rode in
a group of two or three most of the way there and most of the way
back.  I've heard that it's quite different to ride alone, and I
expect I'll get the chance to find out (unless someone wants to ride
up north with me...  ;)  Oh, yeah, and it took me five hours of wall
time to ride the 94 km, but only 4 hours of riding time.  I wonder why
the huge difference, since I didn't stop for an hour at the
midpoint.  Ah well, one of cyclings unexplained mysteries, I presume.</p>
