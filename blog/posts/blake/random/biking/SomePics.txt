ride.  Often it's when I'm about to reach a large round number on my
odometer.  (Shut up, 2000 km <b>is</b> large.  Anyways, I'm going to
follow <a
href="http://crazybikerchick.blogspot.com/2005/06/powers-of-two-this-milestone-was.html"
>Tanya's lead</a>, and use large numbers that are powers of 2, which
will let me take another pic at 4096 km, instead of having to wait for
5000.  But that's not why I'm doing it.  I'm doing it because I, too,
am a huge geek.)</p>

>Tanya's posts</a> I've been running into a lot of tiny bugs recently,
and have started to bike with my mouth firmly shut on some portions of
my ride, lest I fill up on bugs before eating dinner.</p>
