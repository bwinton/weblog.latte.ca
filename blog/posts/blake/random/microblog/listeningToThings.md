In high school and university, I used to listen to a lot of music.  As I went
about my day, there would continually be something on the cd player.  But
these days I find myself listening to podcasts[^podcasts] in my spare audio
time instead, and that strikes me as interesting because without meaning to I
seem to have moved from (largely) mass-produced, mass-marketed entertainment
to (mostly) independent, informational[^informational] entertainment.

[^podcasts]: The list, in alphabetical order, is: [Accidental Tech Podcast](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/2516/nGKpf2) • [After Dark](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/61666/EwNC1R) • [Bitsplitting](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/11651/e2mzzo) • [Core Intuition](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/8860/DSqCCw) • [Edge Cases](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/67268/9juAiU) • [Fear the Boot](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/10994/okyG19) • [Isometric](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/112240/nKrozX) • [JavaScript Jabber](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/81318/X5vDYV) • [LESS THAN LIVE with KATE OR DIE](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/115832/L7YHFg) • [Lostcast](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/26408/7nZ07n) • [No Such Thing As A Fish](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/104040/tiKzXE) • [The Diecast](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/125398/wFBDkj) • [The Dungeons & Dragons Podcast](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/11010/SVo0r8) • [The Incomparable](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/37062/40ldaa) • [The Stack Exchange Podcast](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/1390/AgcE78) • [The Web Ahead](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/9214/j1Nbiy) • [Total Party Kill](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/99714/bZtLy4) • [Webcomics Weekly](https://overcast.fm/podcasts/show/120025/cprNQD)

[^informational]: I’ll readily agree that most of the things I learn aren’t going to impact my life in any significant way.  I’m not going to read many comics, or play many role-playing games, or do, uh, whatever QI does, but they’re still fun to listen to.  :)
