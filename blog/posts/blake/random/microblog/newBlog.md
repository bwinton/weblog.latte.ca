One of the things I did over the holidays (so far) is upgrade the software that
powers [the blog](http://weblog.latte.ca).<!-- TEASER_END -->  I was fairly disappointed with the
number of packages I had to try before finding one that fulfilled all my
requirements, and even then I ended up writing a bit of the functionality I
needed.  Anyways, the one I ended up with was [Nikola](http://getnikola.com/),
which generates a static site, handles posts with the same name in different
sub-folders, and does incremental re-building so it doesn’t take an hour to
update every time I add a new post.

I _think_ I’ve correctly mapped the comments over from the old urls to the new
urls, but the process is going to take 24 hours for Disqus to run, so I won’t
really know until sometime tomorrow.  (Comments on new posts should just work,
if I understand it correctly) But in the meantime, I can totally write blog
posts on my laptop, and have them sync over Dropbox and get automatically
posted.  :)

Perhaps in the coming days, I’ll write a little bit about the extra code I had
to write to get it all working the way I wanted, but for now I think I’m going
to close the computer and watch some TV with the kids.

Merry Christmas, all!
