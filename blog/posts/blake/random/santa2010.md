Dear Santa,

[Everyone else](http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/stuff/xmasList2010.html) is
[doing it](http://weblog.latte.ca/delphine/santa2010.html), so here’s my
list, too.

* A Blu-Ray of a fireplace, perhaps with a secondary audio track of
  christmas music.
* Dollhouse Season 2 on Blu-Ray.
* Books are always nice.  I’m in the mood for one of Ian Banks' Culture
  series, but I’m not sure which ones I haven’t read.
* Whichever Usagi Yojimbo collections I’m missing.
* Another two ([or three!](
  http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/cubegoodies/bbe8/?source=google_toys&cpg=ogty1&gclid=CO6b2MH-5qUCFU0J2godRD-TtA
  )) sets of BuckyBalls.  (I would get [Zen Magnets](
  http://zenmagnets.com/), but I’ve already got BuckyBalls, and I don’t
  think I want to mix them.
* a digital photo frame, for the office.
* A tiny usb [monitor](
  http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/usb-gadgets/c609/).  (There are also
  touch-screen versions for more money, but I’m a little leery about them.)
* Perhaps an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) to play around with.

Well, that’s all I can think of off the top of my head.

Thanks,
Blake.
