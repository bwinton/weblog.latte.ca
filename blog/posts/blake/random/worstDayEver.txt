<p>Wow!  This has started off as the worst day I've had in a very long time.
On my ride to work, someone walking past me snagged my headphone cord with
their purse, and yanked the cord out of both my ears, and my Clie.  Damn
did it ever hurt, and apparently broke my right headphone, since now no
sound comes out of it.  Then, I just missed the elevator, and no-one in it
was nice enough to hold the door for me.  Once I got to the office, I tried
to make oatmeal, but it boiled over in the microwave after a minute, so I
cleaned it up, and decided to cut my losses and just eat the slightly
crunchy gruel it's ended up as, and on my way back to my desk, I spilled
the cup of coffee I was carrying.</p>

<p>I'm sure it'll get better as the day goes on, but at this point, I'm
just afraid of what'll happen next.</p>
