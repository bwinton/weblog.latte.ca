I’ve been doing [a lot of work](
http://moxie.fligtar.com/thunderbird/3.0b4-blockers//sort:bugsFixed)
recently, in preparation for the next (and last!) beta of Thunderbird 3,
and I’m happy to announce that [it was released](
http://ccgi.standard8.plus.com/blog/archives/270) yesterday!

![Update now!](/images/blake/TB3.0b4.png "The Update Notification.")

The reviews from [LifeHacker](
http://lifehacker.com/5365214/thunderbird-3-beta-4-available-for-download)
and [Ars Technica](
http://arstechnica.com/open-source/reviews/2009/09/hands-on-thunderbird-3-beta-4-hatches-with-improved-search.ars)
have been positive, which is always gratifying to see on something you’ve
spent a lot of time on.
