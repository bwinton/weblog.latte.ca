Since [we released](
http://mozillalabs.com/messaging/2010/12/14/get-an-account/) the
[GetAnAccount addon](
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/get-an-account/), we’ve
had a lot of feedback.  Many of the people who commented were looking for
the option of getting an ad-supported account instead of paying for email
access.  We were always planning on integrating ad-supported services, as
soon as we could, but of course, doing this required a redesign.

One important note before we get to the good stuff: I’ve used GMail soley
as an example of a well-known ad-supported email provider here.  We may or
may not be partnering with them, and you should not take these screenshots
as proof of our intentions one way or another.

As you can see from this first mockup, the initial view makes it much more
obvious that you don’t need to create a new account just to use
Thunderbird.

   title="Initial View" alt="Initial View"
   width="50%" align="center"/></a></center>

If you click in the bottom half, it expands up to make it more obvious that
that’s what you want to do, and to allow us to display more information
(although we don’t have any extra information to display there yet.

<center><a href="/images/blake/GetAnAccount/02-Click_on_Bottom.svg"><img
   src="/images/blake/GetAnAccount/02-Click_on_Bottom.svg"
   title="Click on Bottom" alt="Existing Address"
   width="50%" align="center"/></a></center>

On the other hand, if you click on the top, we do have more information
that you probably want to see before continuing on.

<center><a href="/images/blake/GetAnAccount/03-Click_on_Top.svg"><img
   src="/images/blake/GetAnAccount/03-Click_on_Top.svg"
   title="Click on Top" alt="New Address"
   width="50%" align="center"/></a></center>

And this is something like what we hope to show you when the results have
been returned.  (Note: the Terms of Service, Existing Account, and Do It
Later buttons are still there, but have been scrolled off the bottom of
the dialog in this mockup.)

<center><a href="/images/blake/GetAnAccount/04-Searched.svg"><img
   src="/images/blake/GetAnAccount/04-Searched.svg"
   title="Search Results" alt="Search Results"
   width="50%" align="center"/></a></center>

And finally, once you pick one of the providers, we expand that list to
show you all of the results for that provider.

<center><a href="/images/blake/GetAnAccount/05-Chosen.svg"><img
   src="/images/blake/GetAnAccount/05-Chosen.svg"
   title="Choose a Provider" alt="Provider Chosen"
   width="50%" align="center"/></a></center>

Feedback, as always, is welcome, either here or in [the forum](
