Over the past week, I’ve been working on fixing some of [the reported
bugs](https://github.com/mozilla/opensearch/issues) in the OpenSearch
add-on for Thunderbird, and now I think I’ve [fixed enough](
https://github.com/mozilla/opensearch/issues/closed) of them to release a
new version.  

You can find the full details on [the Mozilla Labs blog](
http://mozillalabs.com/messaging/2011/02/25/opensearch-updated/), or you
could just jump straight to [the OpenSearch add-on page](
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/opensearch/) to install
it.  And please leave your feedback about the add-on on [our Google group](
https://groups.google.com/d/topic/mozilla-labs/t1wGyH8CDmQ/discussion)!
