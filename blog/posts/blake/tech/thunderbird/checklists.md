I’ve created a couple of checklists, and would like to hear any feedback on
them.  They are a [Review Checklist](
https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Bwinton/Review_Checklist), and a [Commit
Checklist]( https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Bwinton/Commit_Checklist).

They came about after I had been working mostly on experimental add-ons for
a while, and then attempted to push a couple of reviewed fixes.  Since I
was out of practice, I managed to get something minor wrong on both of the
pushes.  (The first one failed to attribute the patch to the proper author;
The second one failed to mention the bug number in the commit message.)
Since I’m a bit of a perfectionist, this really annoyed me, and so I vowed
to write up the steps that I go through when I need to commit and push a
patch, so that I could refer to them later, since if [checklists can save
lives](http://us.macmillan.com/thechecklistmanifesto), then I figure they
can probably also help me do my job better.  But before I go to that, I
needed to review a patch, so I wrote up some of the things I look for when
I review a patch too.
