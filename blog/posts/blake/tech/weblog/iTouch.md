A while ago, I had bought an iPod Touch, and started messing around
with the CSS on this weblog, to try and get it looking a little nicer
on the small screen.  Sadly, it never quite worked, and because of a
bug in my selector (“min-device-width” should have been
“max-device-width”), I broke the weblog for Safari too.  Fortunately,
today, I grabbed a copy of the latest version of Safari, and fixed the
bug!  So now iPhones and iTouches will both get a pretty version of
the site, and Safari 3.1 looks beautiful again.  Even more beautiful,
now that SVG is supported.  ([Give it a try](

green ? in a circle.)
