<p>Yup, it's the third Friday of this month, and so it's time for
another call out.  This time the random name generator has come up
with Leontine.  (I tried telling it that you weren't really a silent
lurker, and that you already post stuff on <a
href="http://leontinemay.blogspot.com/">your own weblog</a> (mmm,
pretty pictures...), but being a piece of software, it wouldn't listen
to me.  Cursed Artificial Non-intelligence.)</p>
