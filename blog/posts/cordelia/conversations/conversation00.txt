<p>
Cordelia is so funny and verbal that I think
we almost take the cute things she says for
granted, but I'm going to try and write some
of them down for posterity, and Delphine's
too!

<p>
Today,
Cordelia had just woken up from her nap and 
she accompanied me into the bathroom while
I peed.  After I finished peeing she said
"You need paper?"  I agreed and she got
me one little piece of toilet paper, crumpled
up into a tiny ball.
</p>
<p>
I looked at it and  said, "I have to get some 
more because my bits are very big."
</p>
<p>
She said, "I like your hairy and big, strong
bits!"
</p>
<p>
"Thank you!"
</p>
<p>
"And also your slippers."
