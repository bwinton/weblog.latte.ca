I posted this as a comment over at <a href="http://www.hollie.us/">Hollie's
blog</a> and thought I should put it here too.

We were at the grocery store today and Blake and Cordelia were 
having conversations on the pretend phone – you know the one 
you make with your little finger and thumb outstretched?

Well, Cordelia called Blake and said, “Is Mummy there?” Actually, 
what she said was “Give it to Mummy”, but she meant “Is Mummy there?”

So Blake held his pretend phone up to my face, and I said, “Hello?”

Cordelia paused, giggled, and said, “Bye!”

That’s right, she prank-called me on the *pretend phone*.
