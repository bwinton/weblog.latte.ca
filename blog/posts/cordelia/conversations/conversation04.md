When you read this you have to try and imagine Cordelia's parts 
in Cordelia's voice,
which is squeaky and loud and very enthusiastic. She also still 
pronounces "th" as "d", so really everything she says sounds hilarious.

**Cordelia:** I can't decide if I should marry Charlie [her newborn cousin] or 
Otis!<br />
**Me:** I think you should marry Otis, because Charlie is already related to 
you.<br />
**Cordelia:** (Thinks about it.) But Otis doesn't like kissing, and kissing 
is how you get married!

**Me:** We only have three sea monkeys left. <br />
**Cordelia:** But maybe two of them will get married and have babies! <br />
**Me:** Do you need to get married to have babies?<br />
**Cordelia:** No! (Thinks.) But you need to have a house!<br />
**Me:** Why? <br />
**Cordelia:** Because you have to do a naked hug to have babies! And if 
you don't have a house everyone will see you do a bits-bits hug! 
And bits are private!
