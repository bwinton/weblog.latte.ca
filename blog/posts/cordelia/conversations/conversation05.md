Sometimes talking to Cordelia is exhausting because she likes to say
things *very thoroughly*. So yesterday I was in the shower and she knocked
on the door and said, "C'n I go pee?"

"Sure, as long as you don't flush."

"Okay, mama, I was going to tell you when I was going to flush!"

"Okay, thanks."

"So you can get out of da water!"

"Yeah, that's right."

"But not out of da shower!"

"No."

"Just out of da water part of da shower!"

"That's right."

"But stay in da shower!"

"Yes. Thank you."

"But go out of da water!"

*sigh* "Right."
