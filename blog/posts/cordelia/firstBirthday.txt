Today was Cordelia's birthday.  She's one!  She walks!  She's funny
and awesome and tomorrow we are taking her to the doctor so I will
tell you if she's abnormally tall or whatever.

We had a nice day; Blake took the day off, we went out for pastries
this morning, baked a cake, went to the library, went for pastries 
(again), went to look at a house, came home, iced the cake, had a
little tea party with Ursa and her posse and Baba and Zaida, and 
bought the house.  Because isn't that what every little girl wants
on her birthday?  A new house?
