Actually Cordelia turned five exactly a month ago, but I haven't had time
to blog about it until now. (I want to blog about that, too. Who knows if
I will find the timeâ€¦)

We had a little birthday party for her &ndash; her first real party
with friends. She invited Ursa and Otis, Scarlett, Anna, and Zoey. And
Amelia kind of crashed &ndash; Delphine invited her. The kids decorated loot
bags, played freeze dance and What Time Is It Mr. Wolf?, and some other games.
(**Big** thanks to Tanya for playing games with everyone. I hate games.)
We ordered pizza, which is so lame but I didn't feel like prepping a bunch
of stuff, and then we had cake. Cordelia requested a rainbow cake with 
plain icing (I upsold her to chocolate icing) and Smarties, and that's
what she got. Pictures to come.

Cordelia loves home. She would love to be home all the time, or
failing that, wherever I am. She has announced her intention to marry
Otis, live in my house and have babies, which I will take care of
for her.

I don't know how much Cordelia loves school. I think she's pretty happy,
but it's not her element the way it is Delphine's.  I'm not sure 
what she's good at &ndash; she doesn't talk much about
lessons or class activities &ndash; and I don't know what she enjoys.
I'm looking forward
to our first parent-teacher interview to find out how she's getting 
along.

Cordelia's still our baby. She doesn't like to do things for herself &ndash;
she asks us to spread her butter, zip her jacket, carry her backpack...
I try to get her to do things, but I think I'm doing more for 
her than I did for Delphine at five, simply because this time I don't have 
a three-year-old to look after.  Also Delphine's always been very
independent, and Cordelia's... not. But she'll grow up when she gets
around to it. We can wait.
