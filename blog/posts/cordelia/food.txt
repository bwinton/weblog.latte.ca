<p>
Since I started Cordelia on "solid" food at six months,
(instead of four as I did with Delphine) it seems like
she's graduated from starter mush to real, chewable food
really quickly.

Some time in the last couple of weeks she has learned to
chew, and today for supper she had pasta, peas and canned
salmon -- the same thing Delphine and I had for lunch
yesterday.  People food - cool!
