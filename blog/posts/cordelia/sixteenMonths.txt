Cordelia has been talking for a while; her
first words were about the same as Delphine's,
"up" and "cat" and "Daddy!"  In the last 
couple of weeks her vocabulary has really 
expanded; "stuck" and "spoon" and "Mimi",
"baby", "milk", "'delia", "book", "more".  
</p><p>
She's changed in the last few days.  We
make fun of Blake's parents because
they always say the girls have changed,
every week: "she's changed so much!"  But
this week Cordelia really <em>has</em> 
changed, with
her words, with putting ideas together,
with wanting to be read to;
even her face looks less babyish.
</p><p>
Cordelia is very good at putting things
away; she joins in when I'm putting toys
in boxes, she puts books back on the shelf.
She loves lining up cups on coasters; she
loves order.  I think she's going to be the
neat one.
</p><p>
I've complained before about how tedious
and high-maintenance babies are, and I'm
not about to stop, at least not until Cordelia
is past the tedious and high-maintenance
stage.  Babies and stairs, particularly,
don't mix; if I were smarter I wouldn't
have moved from a one-floor condo to a
three-floor house until after Cordelia 
could manage stairs.
</p><p>
Here is what I have to do if I need to go
to the bathroom when I am with Delphine:
</p><p>
<ol>
<li>Say "Hey, Delphine, I am going to go
    to the bathroom".</li>
<li>Go upstairs, do my business, and come
    back.</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
Here is what I have to do if I need to go
to the bathroom when I am with Cordelia:
</p><p>
<ol>
<li>Find Cordelia.</li>
<li>Pick up Cordelia.</li>
<li>Open baby gate, carry Cordelia upstairs.</li>
<li>Go into bathroom, close door, put 
Cordelia down, do my
business while trying to pursuade Cordelia
to stay out of the trash, leave the toilet
brush alone, and not unravel the entire roll of
paper.</li>
<li>Pick up Cordelia.</li>
<li>Carry Cordelia downstairs.</li>
<li>Lock baby gate.</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
It's just... ugh.  It's just that little 
babies are so <em>physical</em>!  So 
physically demanding.  And prone
to falling off things.  Cordelia falls
off things all the time; she has fallen
off the step stool, off an upturned Lego
container, off the couch... it's a rare
day, in fact, when she doesn't fall off
something.
</p><p>
On the other hand, there something nice about
babies.  Cordelia adores us; she is
delighted to see us every morning, she 
comes to us when she is sad or hurt, she
loves to cuddle and kiss and play with
us endlessly.  We are her life, her sun
and moon and stars, in a way
that we just aren't with the infinitely 
more complicated Delphine, who tells me
I am not her friend at least once a week,
who sometimes gives me the silent treatment
when I pick her up from daycare, who argues
about every damn thing just for the sake of
it.  Cordelia is still at the stage where
she is our little dolly, she can safely
be objectified, whereas Delphine is well on
her way to being an actual person, and
like any person, she on occasion objects
to being scooped up and snuggled, she 
sometimes wants to be left alone, she
frequently has desires which conflict with
ours.
</p><p>
I'd still rather that than have to carry
her everywhere, though, which is why I am
still looking forward to Cordelia being a
little older and little more physically 
autonomous.  But for now I am enjoying the
unadulterated baby love.
