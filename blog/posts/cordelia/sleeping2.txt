You may be wondering how Cordelia's sleeping situation is
working out.  Probably not, but I want to write this down
because it's one of those things that parents forget, like
the pain of labour.
</p><p>
If you recall, last I posted Cordelia's crib was in our
bedroom, and she wasn't sleeping very well at night.
We had it like that for a while because we were going 
to go on vacation and didn't see the point in trying to
fix anything until we got back.
</p><p>
When we were on vacation, Cordelia slept in another 
room and Delphine slept in our room.  Cordelia took
good naps, two a day, and slept in her own bed from
around six in the evening until three in the morning.
When she woke up at three, I brought her into our bed
because I didn't want her crying to bother my parents.
Needless to say we weren't well-rested on our 
holiday.
</p><p>
When we got back, we recreated the situation with
Delphine in our room and Cordelia in another room --
Delphine's room, actually -- because that worked
very well.  Delphine sleeps like a log so we don't
wake her up when we come to bed, whereas Cordelia is
a delicate flower when it comes to sleep.
</p><p>
So far that has been working perfectly.  I put
Cordelia down at around 5:45 -- the routine is
diaper, pyjamas, brush teeth, nurse (usually to
sleep but sometimes she doesn't fall asleep), 
soother, bed -- I close the door and either 
she sleeps or she cries and then sleeps.  She
doesn't usually cry for more than five minutes,
but you can tell we're second-time parents because
we don't even time it any more.
</p><p>
She doesn't seem to wake up overnight, or if 
she does it's for one or two cries, then back
to sleep again.  She wakes up at around 5:45
or 6:00 in the morning.
</p><p>
She has two naps, at around 9:00 am and 1:00
pm.  The routine for them is diaper, nurse, 
soother, bed, and again sometimes I put her
down still awake.  Sometimes she cries, sometimes
she doesn't, and she usually sleeps for between
forty-five minutes (bad) and two hours (good).
</p><p>
So chalk up another victory for Weissbluth. The
only remaining challenge is figuring out how to
get both girls sleeping in the same room, so we
can have our bedroom back.
