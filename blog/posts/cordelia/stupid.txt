This pregnancy is starting to make its presence felt in some annoying ways,
and some less annoying.
</p><p>
On the less annoying side, I seem to have popped in the last week or so.
My belly is all round and sticky-outy, and I have developed that pregnant
woman habit of resting a hand on top of it, like it's my own portable arm
rest.  
</p><p>
More annoying are the varicose veins.  (Thanks for the genes, Mum!)
I did some research and apparently
they usually go away after the pregnancy ends, but in the meantime I'm
supposed to put my feet up, and not stand too much, and also not sit too
much, and not cross my legs, and wear support hose (SO not going to happen).
</p><p>
None of that sounds so bad, but I'm just about up to here with things I'm
supposed to do or not do and I am pissed off that there's another whole
set to think about.  Although on the other hand it does give me an excuse
to buy the matching ottoman to go with our glider rocker, and then Bogart
it for the rest of this pregnancy.  See?  Silver lining.
</p><p>
Most annoying of all is that I am scheduled for a test for gestational
diabetes.  <a href="http://baby.latte.ca/journal/0301/09.html">Last
time</a> I opted to not do the test, but this time we know that I have
had a large baby before, and my mother is diabetic, and I am overweight.
Those last two were true last time too but apparently that midwife was
less concerned about them than the one we have now.  (One of the annoying
things about GD is that there is no standard of care for it in Ontario so
every practitioner does their own thing.)  Soooo, I am doing the
thing with the fasting and the sugary drink and the blood tests for
hours.
</p><p>
I'm a little freaked out about it.  I did some reading and GD is kind
of a pain in the ass, what with the no sugar and all.  I really hope
I don't have it, but on the other hand going through this whole process
and even just thinking about it is reminding me that I am at risk for Type II
diabetes and I should watch what I eat and get enough exercise and all
that.  Like Blake says, "GD: Practice Diabetes!"
