Cordelia says "free four!" when there is something to be counted.
"Free four babies!"  "Free four cows!"  She also knows six and
eight.  "Free four six eight!"  That's when there are really 
a lot of whatever it is.

Cordelia says "Feen" for Delphine, and "Heeya" for Zaida, and
"Dooya" for Cordelia.

Cordelia says "haavee" when something is hard, and "ow" when
something hurts.  If I am hurt she says "owwee Mommy"
and then gives me a hug; she's very compassionate for a little
person.  She also likes to hug Delphine when she's sad, especially
after they have had a fight.
