Cordelia's walking.  Just a few steps at a time, and she would rather
crawl if she's in a hurry, but she's definitely walking, in her
eleventh month.

Otherwise not much is going on (surely that's enough?).  She is
cute and funny and if you make kissy noises while you are holding
her she will dive bomb your face with mouth wide open for a big
sloppy kiss.  She still has two naps a day, although they are
getting shorter and more fitful and I expect she will move to
one nap fairly soon.  She sleeps from six fifteen or so in the
evening until six in the morning. Except for the other day; the
other day she slept until seven and I literally went into her
room to make sure she wasn't dead.  (She wasn't.)

And in a couple of weeks we will be having a birthday celebration!  
Mostly I am really excited because it means we can
give her egg; her not eating egg makes it seem like every interesting
food in the world has egg in it.  Pancakes!  Muffins!  Scrambled...
well... egg!

She has an uncanny ability to find any unguarded toilet and play with
it.  I am almost tempted to thoroughly clean one of the toilets and
just assign it to her.  
And she just spread the contents of one box of toys over three
rooms-worth of floor.  And I wonder why I have a bad back.  She's
trouble, this one.  But cute.
