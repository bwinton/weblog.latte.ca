Delphine and I were walking to a playdate a few weeks
ago.  As we walked she asked me about the names of the
streets we were on, and which way they all go.  I
said, maybe sometime we can make a map of the neighbourhood.
"Maybe," I said, "you could do it at your playdate, and
your friend's mother could help."

"That would be fun." said Delphine, "But my friend will
only want to play fairies!"

Then she paused and said, "No-one ever wants to do what
I want to do."  (She is prone to these gloomy 
generalizations.)  "None of my friends like what
I like."

I explained to her that she has only met thirty people her
age at school, plus a handful more at daycare and around.
I said as she goes through school she'll meet more people and
maybe one day she we meet someone who wants to make maps
instead of playing with fairies.  Sooner or later we
all find our people.
