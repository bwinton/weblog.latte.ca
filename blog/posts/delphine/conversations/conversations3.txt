We're reading <em>Franklin Rides a Bike</em>.  It's all about how 
practicing at stuff makes you better (a lesson, incidentally,
that I didn't learn until I got to university, and then it was
only when I noticed how much better my typing was after spending
so much time on alt.kids-talk.  But I digress.)  <em>Franklin
Rides A Bike</em> says "Fox tried and
tried [to hit a baseball], and one day, he hit a home run!"
</p><p>
Delphine:  And who else hit a home run?<br/>
Me: I don't know, who else?  Delphine?<br/>
Delphine: Yeah.  And Mummy!  And Cordelia!<br/>
Me: Did Zaida hit a home run?<br/>
Delphine, in the tone of one speaking to the village idiot: No!
Zaida's a boy!
</p><p>
Huh.  I wish I could get into her head and figure out what
she thinks a home run is.

Delphine can't pronounce "l"s.  It's not a big deal -- you're not
supposed to be able to pronounce everything until you're five.
But it gives her a unique accent, and I am always interested to
see what she substitutes for L.  Franklin is "Frankwin".  "Mary
had a little lamb" is "Mary had a yittle yamb".  And Cordelia
is just "Cordeeya", with a long Italian-style double-e.
</p><p>
I think she also uses "f" instead of "th", but I am so used to her
accent that I don't really notice.  (This happens to me a lot -- I
will get so used to mentally translating accents that I forget 
people have them.  I'm especially good at Chinese accents, but
it kind of blew my mind when I talked to a Chinese guy in England,
at my last job.  Instead of having a Canadian Chinese accent
he had an English Chinese accent.  It took me a few seconds
to recalibrate my accent filter and figure out what he was
saying.)
