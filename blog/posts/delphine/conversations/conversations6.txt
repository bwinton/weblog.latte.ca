She doesn't say such curious things any more, because
her language skills are better, but she's still pretty
amusing.

Today I went to pick her up from daycare, and asked
if she wanted to wear her sweater home.  She said
"I would rather not wear my sweater."  We don't 
talk down to her or modulate our vocabulary or
grammar, so she comes out with these very 
grown-up-sounding words and constructs.  Maybe they're only
funny if you can hear them coming out of a three-year-old.

On the way home we walked past another mother with a
baby, and Delphine said, loudly and in a scandalized
tone, "The baby has no shoes on!"  Fortunately the other
mother just laughed.

After supper Blake arrived home, having biked.  It's
warm today so he was pretty sweaty.  Delphine said
"You're wet like water, Daddy!  We could swim in
you!"
