I mentioned in a previous post that Delphine likes to
postpone the actual sleep part of bedtime by coming
up with ingenius time-wasting requests.  I will be
sitting in the living room and I will hear the quiet
click of the bedroom door opening, and Delphine will
emerge in her adorable pajamas and look at me with
improbably large eyes and say "Mummy..."  I regard 
her seriously, and after a moment of silence I say
"Yes?"
</p><p>
And she says "I need another buddy."  Or, "I need cold
fresh water."  Or, "I need a
cuddle."  And today, the best yet,
</p><p>
"Can I be a juggler?"
</p><p>
I took a deep breath, tried not to laugh:  
"Yes, when you grow up you can be a juggler, but
right now you have to go to sleep."
</p><p>
And she solemnly turned around and climbed back 
into bed.
