This Saturday Delphine broke a lifelong no-Macdonald's streak
by visiting the place for a friend's birthday party.  The party
was enjoyed by all, and Ursa and her mom joined us for the
bus ride home.
</p><p>
On the way, Delphine and Ursa amused us with their knock-knock
jokes:
</p><p>
Ursa: Knock knock!<br/>
Delphine: Who's there?<br/>
U: Orange!<br/>
D: Orange who?<br/>
U: Orange you glad a banana?
</p><p>
And then they laughed.  And then they told it again.  And again.
</p><p>
Delphine actually managed to deliver the "anita" knock-knock
joke successfully, but only once.  The second time it went
like this:
</p><p>
D: Knock-knock!<br/>
U: Who's there?<br/>
D: Anita!<br/>
U: Anita who?<br/>
D: Anita teeth!
</p><p>
(Delphine's go-to word when she needs to say something silly
is teeth, pronounced "teef".)
</p><p>
And then Ursa said "You need to learn some more jokes!"  Mmm-hmmm!
Anyone know any good knock-knock jokes?
