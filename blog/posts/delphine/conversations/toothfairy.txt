Delphine: Is the tooth fairy real?<br/>
Me: What do you think?<br/>
D: I think she is real.<br/>
Me: Why?<br/>
D: She has wings, and wings are real, so she is real.
</p><p>
Kind of hard to argue with that, but I tried it anyway.
</p><p>
Me: Are fairies real?<br/>
D: No.<br/>
Me: Is the tooth fairy a fairy?<br/>
D: Yeah.<br/>
Me: So if fairies are real, and the tooth fairy is a fairy,
how can she be real?<br/>
D: She's sort of... in between.<br/>
Me: In between real and not real?<br/>
D: Uh, in between a fairy and real.

She has also taken to saying "Let's run along, and not get into
trouble."  "I am going to run along, and not get into trouble."
You go do that, then!
