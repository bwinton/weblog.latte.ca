The other day Delphine peered intently at the world map
we got for my birthday for a while, and then announced
"I read San!  S-a-n is San!"  That's the first word she
has read apart from her name and a few words that she'd
memorized like "o-f-f off" and "n-o no".  And it's in
Spanish!  She's bilingual!
</p>
<p>
Then later she read the first syllable of "Doritos", which
is now that I think about it, faux-Spanish.  I'm going to
assume that's a coincience until I get more data.  Anyway
the point is she's almost reading!  Hooray!
