This year was Delphine's first real Hallowe'en &mdash; last year we
skipped it altogether because Cordelia was only a month old, and the
year before we dressed Delphine up and dragged her out to a few
friends' houses, but she was tired and not too pleased with all the
strangers.
</p><p>
This time she was into it; she dressed as a princess (her idea,
and "coincidentally" her two best friends at daycare were also 
dressed as princesses).  I went all out and bought a fancy 
costume; previously I have sworn that buying costumes is lame,
but since then I have realized that a Hallowe'en
costume doubles as a dress-up toy for year-round play, so it
isn't so ridiculous to spend some money for a quality ensemble.
Plus this will fit her for years: fairy princess, medieval princess,
punk princess (after it starts to get ragged).
</p><p>
We started the night at Delphine's friend Ursa's house, where
we were met by their friend Azale (thus completing the trio of
princesses).  We all went out: Delphine, 
Cordelia, Blake and I, Ursa, Ursa's mum, Azale, Azale's mum and
grandmother, and we were joined later by Morgan and Baba.
The girls really got into it (with some coaching: "What do
you say?"  "Trick or treat!"  "What do you say now?"  "Sank you!")
</p><p>
We got a good half-grocery-bag full of candy, including some
Lindt squares, two full-sized candy bars (which we had to confiscate
on the grounds that that's far too much chocolate for a three-year-old
&mdash; for her own good, of course), and some of those fruit bars, 
along with the usual assortment of fun (fun!) sized candy bars, 
Nibs, Tootsie Rolls (does anyone eat them when it's not 
Hallowe'en?), hard candies and Rockets.  
</p><p>
Delphine was exhausted by the time we got home (but not before
stopping at Starbucks to beg a free kid's hot chocolate with
two helpings of whipped cream and chocolate syrup) so she only  
had a couple of pieces of candy before collapsing.  
</p><p>
I had decided that she could have a piece of candy every day
for the month of November, with any leftovers probably going to
Blake's office, but as it turns out she's only asked a couple
of times.  Good thing, too, because Blake and I have been stealing
her loot shamelessly.
</p><p>
We also dressed Cordelia up for Hallowe'en; it was Kathryn's idea
to dress her as a garden gnome because of her rosy round cheeks and pointed
ears.  I bought her a red hat and a white beard and she looked adorable, 
but perhaps not surprisingly, she hated the costume.  We got some 
pictures of a very
sad little gnome, which I will post, but we didn't manage to keep 
her suited up long enough to take her out.  That's okay, since she
can't have any candy anyway.
