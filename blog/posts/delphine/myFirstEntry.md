My name is Delphine.  There’s another Delphine in the school I go to.  I go
to a K-6 school in Toronto.  My friend at my school’s name is Darina.  She
really likes bugs.  She’s going to dress up as a moth for Halloween.  I’m
dressing up as an elf.

Yesterday, me and my dad cooked dinner.  We had sandwiches, soup, and mini
pizzas.  It was fun to make dinner with Dad.  I liked making the
sandwiches.  I made five sandwiches.  They were tomato, mayonnaise and
cheese sandwiches.  Dad made the soup, and it was very good.  The mini
pizzas were kind of hard to make, because they took a long time.

My friend Ursa has gone to Winnipeg.  We feed her cats.  Her cats’ names
are Hebi-Chan and Columbus.  Here’s a joke: What do you call a locomotive
with a cold?  An achoo-choo train!  One more: Where would you weigh a
whale?  At the whale-weigh station!

Tomorrow is Monday.  I’m going to go to school.  I like art.  I do not like
math.  The end.
