<p>There’s a program called <a
href="http://www.iphoneworld.ca/news/2007/09/08/iphone-programs-sketches/"
>Sketches</a> on my iTouch that Delphine likes to play with
before she goes to sleep.  I recently found out that I could email the
drawings to myself, and so here are Delphine’s drawings from
today.  The one on the left is obviously a flower, with the sun in the
sky.  The one on the right is, uh, just pretty with all the colours
mixed together, I think.</p>
