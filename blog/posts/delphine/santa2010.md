Dear Santa,

In case you're real, this is my Christmas list. 

* I would like a name necklace&mdash;a coloured one. 
* I would like a cat buddy. (That's a stuffie.)
* I would like some chapter books.
* I would like some long-sleeve shirts,
* a butterfly net,
* and binoculars.
* I would like a little Pok&eacute;mon stuffy,
* and a toy Pok&eacute;ball.
* A craft set.

Sincerely,<br />
Delphine
