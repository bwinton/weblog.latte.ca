Delphine is twenty six months old (or thereabouts) and all seems to be
well.  She talks in full sentences, and occasionally  they are gramatically
perfect, which is a bit of a thrill.  
</p><p>
She's still in daycare, three days a week.  She is quite stuck on
one of the other kids there, a little boy named Antonio.  She has
taught herself to jump two-footed, and when she does it she  says
"Are you jumping like Antonio?"  (She communicates a lot in rhetorical 
questions.)  And whenever we talk about daycare, Antonio's name
is always the first to come up.  "Who did you see at daycare?"
"Antonio."  "Who is going to be at daycare today?  "Antonio."
Antonio is a very boisterous and energetic little boy, kind of 
the alpha male of daycare, and I don't know if he holds her in 
the same regard, but I don't think she really cares.
</p><p>
Her latest literary love is Franklin the Turtle.  My dad sent her a 
couple of Franklin books for her birthday.  I was a little skeptical
at first because they are pretty wordy - several paragraphs - and they 
are just prose, not rhyme.  But she sits through them and asks for them
again and again.  We also go back to the usual favourites all the
time; "One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish",  "Each Peach Pear Plum", 
and lots of nursery rhymes.
</p><p>
We haven't really started potty training in earnest.  I'm hoping it
will just happen all by itself.  We have a potty, and sometimes she
sits on it, but never for long enough for a result.  They also
encourage her to sit on the toilet at daycare (they have the cutest
little toddler sized toilets), so I'm hoping one day soon something
will happen.  Antonio is close to being potty trained; maybe that
will help.

We're having trouble with sleep; for the last week (or two?) she
has been resisting going to bed, and crying for ages before finally
sleeping.  We have been going in to see her intermittently. She always
has a raft of byzantine demands; a different blanket, Boy (her doll)
in the crib, Boy out of the crib, a kleenex, and so on.  Clearly she
is just stalling, and it was working really well for her; lots
of attention and extra time with Mummy and Daddy..  
</p><p>
But I got
Weissbluth's "Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child" out of the library
again and having re-read the first few chapters, I think that she is
probably sleep-deprived because we moved her bedtime later a few weeks
ago. (In addition to the trouble sleeping, she has also been acting
very two-ish in the afternoons and evenings -- very contrary and 
tantrumy and generally not like herself at all.)
</p><p>
So we are going to move her bedtime back up to 6:30 or 6:00
(even though I have no idea how we're going to make it work with our
schedules) and starting tomorrow we will let her cry herself to sleep
instead of going in every few minutes.  It's mean but it works.
I was going to start today, but Blake thought it would be nicer to
go in one last time and explain to her that he wasn't going to come back,
and she should just go to sleep.  Sure enough, she didn't cry after that,
so maybe the same thing will work tomorrow.
</p><p>
So, in general, she is getting smarter, and I think prettier, and 
definitely taller. I think my very favourite thing is when Blake brings
her into the bedroom first thing in the morning, and she says
"Hi Mummy!" and we cuddle and read books.
