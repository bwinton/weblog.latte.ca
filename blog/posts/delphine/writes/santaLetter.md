#### To Santa: I Would Like

- a doll
- a marble run
- a marble [in case they don't ship them with the marble run, I guess]
- a fairy dress
- a book of poems
- a Word Girl chapter book
- a deck of cards
- an iPod (earphones) [she doesn't like to leave things to chance]
- a watch
- a mug I can paint

---

I asked her about the iPod (because sad to say, we don't listen
to much music) - she said she wanted to play games.
