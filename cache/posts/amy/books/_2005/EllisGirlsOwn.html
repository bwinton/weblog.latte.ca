<p>I thought this was a collection of short stories, but it's actually
mostly excerpts from young adult novels with female teenage protagonists.
They were all good and made me vaguely interested in reading the full
books (but not actually enough to go ahead and read them).  The only 
thing I particularly noticed was that the stories seemed grimmer than
the stuff I read when I was a kid; there was one about the Holocaust,
one about smallpox in a native family, one about living in Afghanistan
during the rule of the Taliban...  Maybe I read stuff like that when I
was a kid and it just didn't make an impact -- I was pretty shallow.</p>
