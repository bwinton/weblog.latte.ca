This book should be subtitled "Everything You Thought You Knew Is Wrong",
especially if you are or have had any contact with "radicals" or 
"non-conformists" or "progressives", if you think everyone (else) is
walking around in a corporate-induced stupor of materialism, or
if you have ever read <em>Adbusters</em> and felt smug and
superior to everyone who wasn't reading <em>Adbusters</em>.
</p><p>
Since that describes pretty much everyone I know, including myself,
I should say this book was a bit of an eye-opener.  I have to admit
that when I went around reading <em>Adbusters</em> and all that stuff,
it didn't really ring true to me.  I went along with it because
it seemed like everyone else thought it was true, and I wasn't 
confident enough in my own good sense to go against the crowd.
</p><p>
This book, however, does ring true; it has the unmistakable stench
of common sense about it.  Heath and Potter argue that the counter-culture
revolutionary types are basically screwing themselves (and the rest of
us) because they refuse to accept incremental changes to 
our society (like, say, minimum wage laws); they think that our
society is so profoundly screwed up that nothing short of a 
complete overhaul, a revolution, will fix it.  Accepting incremental
changes would imply that society is generally okay and just
needs a few tweaks.  Heath and Potter call bullshit and explain
why in fairly convincing, and amusing, terms.  Also they smack down 
Naomi Klein and Kalle Lasn pretty good, which is fun.

<h4><em>Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies</em> 
by Jared Diamond</h4>

<p>
In this book Diamond attempts to explain why Eurasians have so
much cargo (you know, the stuff we're all brainwashed into wanting
by evil corporations) and why they (we) basically stomp over every
other culture we come into contact with.  It's because we have
the guns, the germs, and the steel.  But why?  Diamond knows.
</p><p>
This book ends up being a history of the world, and the most interesting
one I have ever read.  I am much smarter now that I have read 
this.  You should read it too (except you probably already have;
I am kind of behind the curve here.)
