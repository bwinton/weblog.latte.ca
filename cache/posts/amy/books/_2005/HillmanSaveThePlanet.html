Mayer Hillman is a smart guy, and he wrote this book about global
warming.  He starts by explaining global warming, and why it's a 
real and major problem facing the world.  He presents it as a moral
concern, that it is up to us to make major changes to our lifestyle
in order the save the planet for the next generation.  That we
<em>must</em>.

He proposes a method by which this would be done,
basically that we determine an acceptable amount of carbon monoxide
we can allow into the atmosphere, divide that by the number of people
on the planet, and then through one means or another enforce that
limit, equally on every citizen of the globe.  No special exceptions
for countries and very few for individuals.

Hillman earnestly declares that the only solution to the problem
of global warming is to limit the amount of carbon people are
entitled to generate (he goes through numerous alternatives,
and explains why he believes they are insufficient).  Several times
in the book he says that there is no choice in the matter, the 
only other alternatives are to prevent the developing world from
developing or to just allow global warming to happen, and those
are not acceptable alternatives.

Perhaps I'm cynical, but I'm
pretty sure that last is exactly what is going to happen; time and
again in history humans have seen shit coming down the pipe and
done nothing.  People are too selfish, too lazy, and too obsessed
with economic "progress" and with status to make the huge and
immediate changes that would be needed to prevent the coming disaster.
I would love to be wrong.

My lifestyle is pretty low-impact (we don't have a car and I do
most of my daily living on foot, we live in a multi-family dwelling,
and we don't consume a great deal of stuff, relatively speaking) but
Hillman's book has driven it home to me that the exorbitant number of
flights I take pretty much blows that all away.  Since Delphine was
born we have been to Saskatchewan, New York, Florida, Las Vegas, 
and Saskatchewan again, and we're going to Florida again in February.
That's twelve flights in less than two years: fucking ridiculous.  I
have to cut down, which gives me this horrible fear that I will only
ever be going to Saskatchewan from now on.  Argh.
