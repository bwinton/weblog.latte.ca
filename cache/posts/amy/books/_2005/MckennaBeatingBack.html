This book is about the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service, which goes
out and investigates epidemics wherever they occur in the world.  It's
structured one-epidemic-per-chapter and pretty much every chapter is
interesting.  There's a chapter on anthrax, on AIDS, West Nile, smallpox,
cholera in a refugee camp in Zaire, TB among a transgender community in
Baltimore, and of course, SARS.

McKenna is a good writer and this is a page-turner.  I hope she writes
more books.
