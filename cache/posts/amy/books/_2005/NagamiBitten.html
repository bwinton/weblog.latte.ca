<em>Bitten</em> is essentially a collection of case studies of bites, stings, and
the other indignities that are inflicted on humans by the animals with which we
share our world, interspersed with descriptions of the mechanisms and chemistry
by which the damage is wrought.  Awesome!  It is well-written and appropriately
gruesome.

Things I learned: snails can kill you; if it's
dangerous in the rest of the world it's probably deadly in Australia; Sharon
Stone's husband was bitten  by a Komodo dragon; lots of things that seem to be
healing okay for the first couple of weeks then turn really ugly; American 
patients often don't return for follow-up care or complete their courses of
medication.

Either Nagami or her editor seems excessively fond of "sic":
"The child was in a semi-comatose state and only made to give unintelligible
answers with difficulty [sic]."
What's wrong with that?  I do not know.  
</p><p>
How about this?  "So its bacteria 
was [sic] then inside the bone."  Plural "bacteria" and singular "was", maybe?
How pedantic is that?  I'm think "sic" should only be used 
if there may be some confusion about meaning that would
be cleared if the reader knew that the quote was left in its original, 
uncorrected form.  Using sic just to prove that you are smarter than the
quotee is lame.

The last one is the best: "beautiful 19 month old Rhesus Macaque ... all the
paper's [sic] from his vet showing his shots are all up to date.  He has never
been in a lab, he was born in a private breed does not do well with children."
How did they decide to sic the apostrophic error and yet leave, oh, pretty much
every other word in the quote unsicced?  Why not just sic the whole thing?
