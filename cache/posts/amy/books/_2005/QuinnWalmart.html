This was the first book I managed to read since I got back from Florida;
I've been so tired and sick I could barely face a magazine, let alone
the weighty novels and serious non-fiction that have been showing up
at the library for me.

Fortunately this was a nice easy read.  Bill Quinn writes in a simple,
plain-spoken style and doesn't get bogged down with numbers or long
words.  He's also good and mad, and rightly so if what he says about
Walmart is true, and I have no reason to believe it isn't.  A good
blood-boiling read without any of the tragedy of, say, <em>Leave
None To Tell The Story</em>, the Bible-thick Human Rights Watch 
report on the Rwandan genocide which is currently anchoring my
bedside table and will no doubt stay there until it is due back at
the library.
