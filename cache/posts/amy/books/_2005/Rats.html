Robert Sullivan thought it would be cool to spend a year or so hanging
out in an alley watching some rats, and write a book about it and rats
in general.  It turned out to be a pretty good book, but with a lot
of needless philosophising which didn't seem to result in any great
conclusions, that I could tell.  I would have been happy with just lots
of facts and observations.  (The book has them, just mixed in with the
other stuff.)

Reading this book I realized that I am missing what seems to be a 
fundamental human trait -- I'm not afraid of rats.  I suppose if you
stuck me in a dark alley surrounded by lots of them, I might be, but
when I imagine the scenario it doesn't faze me at all.   We had rats 
as pets and I have a great deal of appreciation for them; they are
intelligent and resourceful and generally very sensible animals.
And unlike cats, they don't vomit.
