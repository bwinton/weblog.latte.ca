This is pretty much a retread of the material in Spurlock's movie
<em>Supersize Me</em> and in <em>Fast Food Nation</em>.  There
is some background information about the filming of the movie --  
or rather Spurlock's health during the filming of the movie --
which is pretty interesting.

All in all I enjoyed the book; Spurlock is a funny and natural
writer (by which I mean he writes in a conversational, easy style).
He is a little hysterical about the subject matter, but I guess
that's the point -- this isn't meant to be a science book.
