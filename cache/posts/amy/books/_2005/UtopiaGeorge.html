<em>Efficient Society: Why Canada Is as Close to Utopia as It
Gets</em> by Joseph Heath.  This is an interesting book about the
benefits of efficiency as a social value, and how Canada is so
great.  I especially like that last part -- who doesn't like to
be patted on the back? -- but I also found the book to be an interesting 
economic and philosophical primer.

<em>A Place Of Hiding</em> by Elizabeth George.  This is a good,
fairly standard mystery, but it seemed to go on forever.  Towards
the end I was just reading it to find out what happened.  It
didn't help that the protagonist is an emotional, slightly idiotic
woman.  She is contrasted with her analytical husband, and I suppose
you are supposed to relate to the woman, but I really didn't.
