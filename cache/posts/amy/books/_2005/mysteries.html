<em>Morality for Beautiful Girls</em> by Alexander MacCall Smith
was nice but I am going to have to spread these books far apart, because
I seem to get tired of them quickly.  I'm not sure why.

<em>Forty Words for Sorrow</em> by Giles Blunt was really good.  It's
nice to read a book set in Canada, and this guy is a hell of a mystery
writer.  It was kind of gruesome, but I seem to be sensitive to that
these days, so it was possibly no more gruesome than most murder
mysteries.  I will read more by this guy.
