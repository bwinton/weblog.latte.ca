<strong><em>Garbage Land: On the Secret Trail of Trash</em> by Elizabeth
Royte</strong>.  This is like the garbage version of the corpse book --
what happens to garbage when we throw it out.  I have only two things
to say: Royte is not as funny as Mary Roach, and people who deal
with garbage are much less keen to talk about it than people who
deal with bodies.

<strong><em>Long Way Round: Chasing Shadows Across the World</em>
by Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman</strong>.  This was pretty
good -- about the authors' motorcycle trip from London to New
York, overland (apart from that awkward Bering Strait bit).
Perhaps not surprisingly (being that they are both actors) they
seem like emotional types; I certainly wouldn't sign up to
bike around the world with either of them.

<strong><em>Talk to the Hand: The Utter Bloody Rudeness of the
World Today, or Six Good Reasons to Stay Home and Bolt the Door</em>
by Lynne Truss.</strong>   Truss is a grumpy woman, and I can't
say I disagree with her that people could stand to be more courteous,
but I think this book makes a lot more sense in England than it
does here -- Canadians are in general polite and friendly to
each other, just like the stereotype suggests.  Whereas the
English... not so much. 
</p><p>
Also Truss's Internet bears no relation to my Internet.  She
seems to conflate her technical problems with computers and
her problems with the culture of the Internet.  Anyway, some
of my best friends are from the Internet, so there.  (I had
a more reasoned response to this earlier, but it's been a while
since I finished the book and now I've forgotten what I was 
going to say.  Hmph.)
</p><p>
Incidentally, this book references a book which is also referenced
by the book I am currently reading (<em>American Backlash</em>
by Michael Adams) which I selected independently of the Truss
book.  The referenced book is called <em>Bowling Alone</em>
by Robert Putnam.  Does that mean I should read it?  Probably.
God, this reading will be the death of me.  Maybe I should give
up watching TV so I have a chance in hell of keeping up with my
own "to be read" list.

<strong><em>With One Lousy Free Packet of Seed</em> by Lynne Truss.</strong>
Funny and a little silly.  Kind of Douglas Adams-ish, although
that might just be because it's an English comedic novel.  Also
kind of Jasper Ffordish, but without the annoyingly clever literary
references.

<strong><em>I'll be the Parent, You Be the Child</em> by Paul
Kropp.</strong>  I got this from the Gender book, and I wasn't
sure what to expect, whether it would be a conservative, spare-the-rod
kind of thing, but to my pleasure it turned out to be by
a Toronto writer who wrote for my favourite parenting magazine.
It's a common-sense overview of various parenting issues, reviewing
the available evidence and giving the bottom line according
to Kropp.  Very sensible advice.  It made me think that I probably
don't want to work full-time until my children are grown -- that
the best thing I can give my children is my time.  But since I
would like to buy some new clothing before I am fifty, I will
be working part-time.

And now Cordelia would like some of that time, so I can write no
more.
