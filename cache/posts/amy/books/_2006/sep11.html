I feel like I haven't updated for ages, but it has only been 
a couple of weeks.  But what did I read?  I was working on
<em>A Son of the Circus</em> by John Irving for a while,
but I got stuck on it.  I think I am trying too hard to look for 
symbolism and subtext and stuff and not just blasting through
the story like I usually do.  Or else it's just not very
interesting, I am not sure which.  I'll get back to it
sometime.

After I gave up on that I read <strong><em>Bloodletting And
Miraculous Cures</em> by Vincent Lam</strong>, a collection
of connected stories about a group of medical students in Toronto.
I quite enjoyed these stories; Lam is an effective writer
with a nice turn of phrase, and I enjoyed getting a glimpse
into the lives of medical students and doctors.  (Lam is
a Toronto doctor as well as a writer.)

And I feel like I must have read some more but I guess blocking
on the Irving book just felt like reading a lot.

I am trying to work on keeping notes when I read but mostly I
forget to do it.  I am not sure how to take notes when I
read fiction; what should I write down?  I think I will try
noting when I think something is an image or a metaphor, and 
then go back and try and figure out what it means later.  
With non-fiction I really need to make a note at the end
of each chapter on what the chapter was about.  I recently 
recommended a book to a friend; she ended up hating it but
it has been so long since I read it that I can barely remember
what I liked about it.  So I just had to nod; "yeah, book
sucks.  Right."

Must... get... smarter...
