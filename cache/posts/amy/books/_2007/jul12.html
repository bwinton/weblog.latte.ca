I am sure I have read a book in the last six months.  Maybe
even two or three.  Now that the reno is over I have run out
of excuses for not reading, so here goes.
</p>
<p>
According to my notebooks I read <b><em>Born To Buy: The 
Commercialized Child and the New Consumer Culture</em> by
Juliet Schor</b> and there wasn't much in there that I
didn't know; companies spend billions marketing all kinds
of products to children.  I was creeped out by the use
of viral and peer-to-peer marketing â€” using kids to sell
stuff to their friends.  The other annoying thing is the
way marketing and consumer culture loves to position
parents as dorky ineffectual losers who should be ignored
as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
Also worth noting is the connection between immersion in
consumer culture and depression in children.  One of the
great things my parents did for me (although not entirely
intentionally) was shelter me from consumer culture to a
large entent, partially by not having TV (or not having
cable) and partially just because we couldn't afford lots
of toys so we mostly found our fun in books from the 
library and plenty of public radio.  Good geeky fun.

<b><em>Kids Are Worth It: Raising Children to be Responsible, 
Resourceful, Caring Individuals</em> by Barbara Coloroso</b>
is a book I read because it's often quoted in the parenting
magazines, and it seemed like one of those books I ought to
read.  And I'm really glad I did; it crystallized a lot of
the vague parenting philosophies I'd had and gave me lots of
ideas and structure for how to implement them: how to treat
my kids with respect, how to provide consequences, how to
discipline.  Coloroso is a great resource for a frazzled
mum because she gives you lots of bulleted lists and 
mnemonics so you can recall her advice in moments of stress.
Which are most of them, really.

Alright, I've read more than two books in the last six
months but now the stupid (I mean lovely) baby is awake
so you'll have to wait another six months for my next 
post.  Adios!
