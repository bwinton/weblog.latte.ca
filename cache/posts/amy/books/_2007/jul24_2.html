<strong><em>Extraordinary Evil: A Brief History of Genocide</em> by 
Barbara Coloroso</strong>.  Like so many of us, Coloroso has been
doing a sort of independent study of genocide and she came up
with the rather surprising, at first glance, theory that genocide
is bullying writ large.  I was pretty skeptical at first but
she sold me on her idea; she has done a lot of thinking about
bullying and she has her trademark bulleted lists on the topic
all figured out, and she manages to map them to genocide 
quite convincingly.  I'll probably check out her book on bullying,
and also a few of the books she refers to on genocide.  A few
of them were on my list before but I chickened out; maybe this
time I will have the guts to actually read them.

  <strong><em>Outbreak: Plagues that Changed History</em> by
Bryn Barnard</strong> is actually a picture book which
I grabbed from the kids' section because I'm all about plagues
and gruesome diseases.  However, it's written at what seems
to me to be a very advanced level.  It is a fantastic book;
each chapter discusses one plague and its effect on society,
and the illustrations (also by the author) are lush.

I didn't actually read <em>The Assault on Reason</em> by Al 
Gore because I had it out of the library and I had to take
it back before I got more than a couple of chapters in.  However,
I was pleasantly surprised; in the chapters I read he got into
why people are so compelled by television, so it seems like he's
really getting into the very roots of why American politics is
so screwed up.  I have put myself on the hold list again (I am number 
249 of 267) and I look forward to having another crack at this
book.  Sometime in 2008.
