<p>Here is the last pile of books I read in 2008.  Since
it's now 2009 I can be reasonably sure I won't add
anything to this list.</p>
<h3>Non-Fiction</h3>
<p><strong><em>Restoration Home</em></strong> <strong>by Mark Bailey, Sally Bailey, and Debi Treloar</strong>
is an interesting decor porn book with a salvage bent.  These
people take shabby chic way beyond rumpled slipcovers and
distressed coffee tables.  They like chipped paint and missing
patches of plaster.  I liked the ideas about using industrial
light fixtures and other fittings, and about reusing found
objects.  I also like the aesthetic of not having everything
perfect and flawless.  Some of the examples in this book go
a little too far for my taste, though, into that crack-house
look.  To each their own.</p>
<p><strong><em>(parts of) Character is Destiny</em></strong> <strong>by John McCain and Mark Selter</strong>
This is a collection, written for a young adult audience, of short 
biographies of various historical figures
chosen by the authors to exemplify various character traits and
support their theory that "character is everything".  I 
picked it up partly because I had (previously) quite liked
and respected John McCain, and because there's a chapter on 
Roméo Dallaire, who I love.  I also ended up reading the 
chapters on Elizabeth I, Winston Churchill, Sojourner Truth,
and a couple others I forget now.  I learned a lot about
the people, which was the main point.  </p>
<p>This book made me wonder what
happened to John McCain that made him stray so far, during
the 2008 campaign, from the decent person he used to be.
I'm sure he's still decent, but something made him act all
crazy.  This probably ties into the fact that character is
indeed not everything and that how people behave is actually 
very strongly affected by the situation they are in (see
<em>The Lucifer Effect</em>.)</p>
<h3>Non-fiction books that are pretty good but that I don't have a lot to say about</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Why Women Should Rule the World</em></strong> <strong>by DeeDee Myers</strong></li>
<li><strong>David Suzuki's</strong> <strong><em>Green Guide</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Traffic</em></strong> <strong>by Tom Vanderbilt</strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mindfulness</em></strong> <strong>by Ellen Langer</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiction</h3>
<p><strong><em>The Road</em></strong> <strong>by Cormac McCarthy</strong> was one of the best fiction
books I read this year, but in the same gruelling "I just want
this to end" way as <em>A Thousand Splendid Suns</em>.  I don't know 
what the connection is between gruelling and really good, but
if I ever come up with a happy and uplifting book which is
really good I will be sure to post about it.  This book hit a
few of my hot buttons: post-apocalyptic, small child, Viggo
Mortenson (okay, he's not in the book but I knew they cast
him for the movie version so that's what the protagonist
looked like in my head).</p>
<p><strong><em>Children of Men</em></strong> <strong>by P.D. James</strong> was really good.  I
didn't know P.D. James did speculative fiction.  This is 
another book I read instead of seeing the movie.</p>
<p><strong><em>What I Was</em></strong> <strong>by Meg Rosoff</strong> was a pretty decent young
adult book about a boy who is sent to a miserable boarding
school in Norwich (can there be any other kind?) and meets
a wild boy who lives on the beach.  They fall for each other
and hang out, there is some tragedy and a surprise ending.
Nice book.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Landing</em></strong> <strong>by John Ibbitson</strong> is yet another young
adult book, about a boy living in Muskoka in the twenties.  He 
plays violin but when you're poor in rural
Canada you're not going to get very far with that kind of
artsy nonsense.  Then he meets a woman who introduces him
to classical music and encourages him to pursue his playing.
Tragedy, rebirth, blah blah blah.  Actually a really good
book.</p>
<p><strong><em>Only You Can Save Mankind</em></strong> <strong>by Terry Pratchett</strong>; I mentioned
this earlier — I read it as a companion to <em>Ender's Game</em> and
like I said earlier, while I don't have as much meaty substance
as the other book it is funnier and equally well-written.</p>
<p><strong><em>Home for Christmas and other stories</em></strong> <strong>by Scott Young</strong> is
a collection of short stories, the old-fashioned kind with
a beginning, middle and end which don't
involve lots of weird allusions or great revelations or moments
of truth.  The kind of short stories that I and Michael Chabon
like.  They're all about Christmas, too.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Other Boleyn Girl</em></strong> <strong>by Phillipa Gregory</strong> is our
next book club book, and while it's not great literature it was
a good read, quite educational (assuming the historical
detail is accurate; I always wonder about that with historical
fiction) and will provide lots of things for us to talk about.</p>
<h3>Memoir</h3>
<p><strong><em>Schuyler's Monster</em></strong> <strong>by Rob Rummel-Hudson</strong>.  Well, the
cover of the book says "Robert Rummel-Hudson" but I've been
reading Rob's journal since Schuyler was just a baby, and
he's always been Rob.  It was cool to read Schuyler's
story in book form, and I liked that Rob kept his smart-assy
voice in the book.  I've always enjoyed Rob's writing and I
find it very hard to be impartial about the book because
I already liked it before I even read it.  I'm looking forward
to reading something of Rob's that I haven't read before.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Alchemy of Loss</em></strong> <strong>by Abigail Carter</strong> is a memoir
by a woman who lost her husband in the 9/11 attacks.  It's about
her grieving process and how she dealt with taking care of 
her two little kids, her family and husband's family, and with
her loss being part of a much bigger loss.  I picked this book
up because I have a fear of losing Blake, sparked in fact by 9/11,
and I wanted to read about how someone else had grieved and then
gone on with her life.  This book is beautifully written, very
honest, and hopeful.</p>
<h3>Parenting and Child Development</h3>
<p><strong><em>The Unschooled Mind</em></strong> <strong>by Howard Gardner</strong> is about how
kids learn about the world, and how educators really need
to take into account children's existing models of the world
when teaching them new things.  Apparently often what happens
is that kids learn two models of the world, the "real"
one and the "school" one.  The "real" model is the model
they kluged together through their observations back when
they were little kids, and the "school" model is techncially
correct but because they were never shown (not told) the errors
of their real-world model they only learn the school model 
by rote and never understand it well enough to take it out
into the real world.  So teachers have to know how to delicately
dismantle children's models — or rather help the children do it —
in order to make room for the new, subtler models.  Very interesting,
although Gardner is pretty dry.  More anecdotes please!</p>
<p><strong><em>The Homework Myth</em></strong> <strong>by Alfie Kohn</strong>.  I love Alfie Kohn.  He's
just so convincing.  In this book he convinced me that most
homework is a useless waste of time, which I'm sure will go over
really well with my kids' teachers.  Whatever, I'm not going to
squander my kids' precious free time doing busywork.  If the teachers
can come up with valuable interesting homework we'll do it.</p>
<p>Of course Delphine will do her homework anyway because she will
be too scared of getting in trouble not to do it.  Maybe Cordelia
will come onboard with my homework rebellion, though.</p>
<p><strong><em>How to Talk so Kids Will Listen And Listen so Kids Will Talk</em></strong> <strong>by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlich</strong>.  Everyone has said everything there is to be
said about this book.  If you deal with kids and you haven't read it
yet you'd better get on it.</p>
<p><strong><em>What to Look For In A Classroom and other essays</em></strong> <strong>by Alfie Kohn</strong>.
More Kohn cleverness.  He's an interesting and intelligent man.  This book
covers diverse topics in education, from standardized testing to the
subtle racism of middle-class mothers.  (Don't get me started on that
one.)  Great book.</p>

blogging for 2009!</p>
