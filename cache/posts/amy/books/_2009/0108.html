<p><strong><em>Three Day Road</em></strong> <strong>by Joseph Boyden</strong>.  This was my 
over-New Year's Day book.  Joseph Boyden is kind of shiny
here in Canada these days because he just won some 
award, I think for his next book.  Okay, okay, I did some
research: he won the Giller Prize (sorry, that's the
Scotiabank Giller Prize) for <em>Through Black Spruce</em>.</p>
<p>This book is about two Ontario Cree who sign up to
fight in WW I.  Actually the book starts when one of
the men returns, and it's told mostly in memories,
the soldier's memories of war and his elderly aunt's
memories of her life.</p>
<p>I would have to say this was a very good start to
a year's reading.  It's a good story, I learned
a whole lot about World War I (which isn't saying 
much because I know next to nothing about World
War I anyway) and got lots of insight into Cree
culture, another embaraassingly large hole in
my knowledge, considering I claim to be from
Northern Saskatchewan, some of the time.  The
book is beautifully written.  I'll have to check
out <em>Through Black Spruce</em> too.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ja, No, Man: Growing Up White in Apartheid-Era 
South Africa</em></strong> <strong>by Richard Poplak</strong>.  Poplak was
born in 1973 and lived in South Africa until he was
sixteen, and ended up in Toronto.  I was born in
1975 and lived in South Africa until I was seven,
and ended up in Toronto.  So I thought this book would
be a cool read and might fill in some holes in my
memory and my understanding of my childhood.
The <em>Globe and Mail</em>
loved this book, and I too love the book.  It's hilarious
and again, very educational (apparently there are
no limits to my ignorance).  Poplak crams in a 
lot of South African history among his droll tales
of corporal punishment and weird racism.  This 
book made me really thankful we got the hell out
of dodge when we did.  It also made me laugh out loud.
(Dave, you should totally read this too.)</p>
<p><strong><em>It's All Too Much: An Easy Plan for Living a
Richer Life with Less Stuff</em></strong> <strong>by Peter Walsh</strong>.
I'm not sure exactly why I keep reading 
organizing books, because it's not like I'm drowning
in clutter.  I can have close friends and family
over almost without notice, and visits from 
less-close friends only call for maybe half an
hour of picking up and cleaning the bathroom.
So it's not like I'm a giant household screw-up.
But it's true that it wasn't always like this.
Our apartment was pretty hideous, and it has taken
me a long time to recognize how much ongoing effort
it takes to keep a house clean and tidy.  </p>
<p>The other thing is I like is to have less stuff, and
to only have the right stuff, and that's what this
book is really about.  Rather than just dig in to
all that <em>stuff</em> Walsh insists that first you think
about what you want from your life, what your dream
life really looks like.  Then he gets you to think
about what you want from your home, and then he gets
you to break it down by room.  For each room in your
house Walsh asks you to make a list of desired 
functions in the room, and get
rid of everything in the room which doesn't meet 
one of those functions.  Once the room is clean,
you designate a physical area for each function,
and then put everything away in the appropriate
area.</p>
<p>This is a good notion and something I might implement
sometime, to some extent, but I think the best 
thing about the book is the yearly schedule of
stuff to do to keep your place in line once you
have sorted it out.</p>
<p>Two other nice things about this book: lots of
anecdotes.  I love anecdotes.  Second Walsh has a
bunch of neat tricks for figuring out whether
you use stuff: turn all your hangers inside
pointing out, and only turn them back when you
wear the item outside of the house.  At the end
of the year, get rid of the clothes which are
still pointing the wrong way.  Or: masking tape
all your Tupperware closed and only untape it
when you use the Tupperware.  After six months
(preferably six months including Thanksgiving
and Christmas) get rid of all the Tupperware
that is still sealed shut.  Or, move all your kitchen
gadgets and utensils to a cardboard box and only
put them away in a drawer when you use them.
If you don't use them in four weeks, toss them.
I don't agree with that time-scale; I have 
useful kitchen tools that I use less often
than four-weekly, but then I think I'm more
of a cook than his target audience, who apparently
can't find their kitchen counters under junk 
mail and clothes that don't fit.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a good book; I enjoyed reading it
and it's helpful too.  I'm slightly embarrassed that I
have so much to say about this rather unsophisticated book and
apparently no more than a paragraph or two to say about the
real books I read.  I'm tired!  And I have rather more hands-on
experience with domestic organization than I do with apartheid
or Cree culture or WW I.  Not much excuse, I know.  Maybe I
need to work on being smarter.  Some more.</p>
