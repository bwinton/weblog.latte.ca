<p><strong><em>Everyday Survival: Why Smart People Do Stupid Things</em></strong> <strong>by 
Laurence Gonzales</strong> is a book about life.
It's a book about the origins of life, about how (and why) life
on earth developed, about how humans got to where we are today
and our purpose in the world, about mindfulness and mental
models and behavioural scripts.  </p>
<p>As such is it one of the most woefully misbilled books I have 
ever read.  I figured I was in for a discussion about how
humans' evolutionary history causes us to make mistakes in
the modern world.  And yea, that is what I got.  In the first
six chapters.  The next ten follow Gonzales in his search for
the origins of life, for answers about why we are here.  Along
the way I learned about energy and entropy, about fractals and
self-organizing systems, organic chemistry, vortices, tornadoes, 
the fact that life thrives in every nook on earth, even in the cores
of nuclear reactors, about giant caves, Murray Gell-mann's theory of
life ("The earth is rotting, and life is the waste."), and 
about why humans have such expressive faces.  And a hundred
other things, all of which Gonzales manages to pull together
in a sensible (if not necessarily linear) way to make his point.</p>
<p>Which point, by the way, is that climate change is the stupidest
thing of all, and that it is well within our capabilities to stop it,
if only we can manage to get out of the behavioural script,
the vacation state of mind, that we are living in now, the
script which says everything has been going fine until now,
so I will keep doing what I have been doing.  Gonzales doesn't
beat the climate change drum very often, but it's a theme that
reoccurs at key points throughout the book.</p>
<p>If I were to nominate a book to be an Atheist Bible, this might
be it.  Gonzales describes the origins of life (as far as we know
about them) and the origins of humankind, and explains why
life came about and what our place is in the universe.  He 
even takes a stab at explaining how we can fulfill our 
potential as human beings.  It is at times an intensely 
spiritual, moving book, whilst always being completely rational.</p>
<p>Lawrence Gonzales is a genius.  The way he digs deep and
deeper into a problem and synthesizes dozens of different 
areas of knowledge is breathtaking.  I had to read this book
with a notebook by my side to keep track of all the new
facts and ideas, and try and join them up like Gonzales did.
But he's such a good writer that it all goes down as effortlessly
as ice cream.    Anyone who is interested in thinking,
who likes a good idea, who loves a eureka moment, or who
wants to know what our place is in the universe should read
this book.  Everyone should read this book.</p>
