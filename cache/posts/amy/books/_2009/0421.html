<p><strong><em>Getting Started As A Freelance Writer</em></strong> <strong>by Robert Bly (2008)</strong>
is about... well, just guess what it's about. It  was on the "new"
cart at the library so I thought I would check it out. Maybe I
can be a freelance writer! Here's how!</p>
<p>Robert Bly has written about a million books, almost all of which
you undoubtedly haven't heard of, and he also writes magazine articles,
marketing material, annual reports, brochures, junk email... pretty
much anything you can make money at. He's not an "author" or a 
"novelist", he's a writer, and in this book he tells you how you
can make a living as a writer too.</p>
<p>Obviously it's hard for me to say whether his advice is any good since
I'm not a writer, nor have I ever read any other books on making
a living as a writer.  It seems pretty sensible - he offers practical
advice on how to set up your office, how to market yourself, how to manage
your writing business, how to find work - but then this guy makes
most of his living writing "direct mail marketing" copy, ie, snake
oil ads.  Bly also makes lots of money through self-published ebooks, 
booklets, giving speeches,
selling CDs of his speeches... basically regurgitating the same
content in as many ways as possible to get more money out of it.</p>
<p>The book also contains sections on gettings cartoons, personal
essays, and poems published.</p>
<p>Ironically, the book could have been better written, or perhaps
better edited. There were a couple of times where he introduced
the same concept twice within a page or two, as if he had rearranged
some paragraphs and then not checked it closely enough.  (This,
I suppose, supports his contention that you don't have to be
a <em>good</em> writer to make a living at it.) The section on the
Internet was terribly dated; "If you think, as some people do,
that there's any future in the Internet". (That's a paraphrase,
I forgot to write down the exact quote.) This edition was a rework
of the 1997 edition, and clearly he should have paid more attention
to the Internet section.</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether this book convinced me that you can make good
money writing, or whether it just showed that you can make money
doing just about anything if you are willing to work hard enough
at selling yourself, and repackaging your material in lots of different
ways. The more I think about it the more it seems what made Bob Bly
rich wasn't being a writer but being an entrepreneur, which is not
to say that you can't make money writing, but Bly's path to riches
isn't exactly the path I want to take.</p>
<p>One more thing - Bob Bly makes lots of money selling books about
how to be a copywriter, and on further investigation there's a
whole online cottage industry of ebooks, email newsletters, etc 
about writing. Doesn't that
seem like a pyramid scheme? Bly sells a book about writing to 2000
people, those people write and sell 2000 books each - what happens when
everyone who wants to be a writer has bought a book about it?
Doesn't someone, at some point, have to write about something
else?</p>

<p>Thomas Foster mentioned the novels of Reginald Hill a few times
in <em>How to Read Novels Like A Professor</em>, so when I found
<strong><em>Pictures of Perfection</em></strong> in a plastic bag at someone's curb,
I picked it up. It says on the cover that it's a Dalziel/Pascoe
mystery, but Dalziel and Pascoe are fairly minor players; the
main investigator is a policeman (I can never remember people's
rank) named Wield who is sent off to an odd little village in
Yorkshire - odd not in the usual Yorkshire way - to discover the
whereabouts of the missing village bobby. On the way to locating
the missing policeman, Wield meets various peculiar village
characters and has to sort out their relationships, their
history, and their intentions. </p>
<p>Reginald Hill writes for an intelligent reader - this book is 
rich with references to literature and music. He has a knack
for describing things in a way which makes you pay attention.
Here he is saying someone has a good memory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wield's brain, which his CID chief, Andy Dalziel, opinied 
should be picked in strong ale and and sold to IBM after the
sergeant's death, had been punching up references to Enscombe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here he says the same character is hairy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wield barked the sound which his friends recognized as his way
of expressing amusement - though others often took it as a 
sign that the interrupted lycanthropic process suggested by
his face was about to be resumed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not writing for a lazy reader.</p>
<p>I very much enjoyed this book; I liked the characters, I liked
the relationships, I liked the mystery.</p>
