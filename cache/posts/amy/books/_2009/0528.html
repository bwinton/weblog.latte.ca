<p><strong><em>Copyediting: A Practical Guide</em></strong> <strong>by Karen Judd</strong> is another guide
to copyediting very much like the last one I read, <em>The
Fine Art of Copyediting</em> by Elsie Myers Stainton. Both offer an
overview of what copyediting entails, along with lots of reference
material: when to use which punctuation, how to capitalize titles,
and so on. Either book would be a valuable addition to a writer
or copyeditor's library.</p>
<p>I don't think copyediting is a good career direction for me;
I revel in the satisfaction of finding obvious mistakes (doesn't everyone?) 
but I would get impatient having to look up everything I wasn't sure
about.  I could be a copyeditor, but I wouldn't enjoy it much.
(Although Judd actually says, 'Copyediting isn't fun," so maybe I'm
missing the point.) But having read these two books, I now know more
about good grammar, good writing and punctuation. Once I start
writing for real I'll buy one of these books and refer to it often.
My editors will love me.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Craft and Business of Writing: Essential Tools for Writing 
Success</em></strong> is a collection of essays about writing, from the
editors of Writers' Digest Books. It's divided
into five sections: Getting Started / General Business, Fiction,
Nonfiction, Children's Writing, and Poetry. Each of the last four
sections is further subdivided into "The Craft of..." and "The
Business of..." The essays are great, both helpful and inspiring.
However, for some reason
they chose to wire-bind the book and wrap it in a giant hardcover like
a big ol' cookbook. Made it very hard to read it in bed,
while brushing teeth, on the can, etc: all my best reading 
spots. So it has taken me weeks to read it. Between the dry-as-dust 
copyediting books and this I've been all clogged up in my reading.</p>
<hr />
<p>A while ago <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/">Greg Wilson</a> suggested I
write a book about survival in the event of a disaster or
collapse of our modern infrastructure.  Seemed like a fine
idea, so I thought I would find out what was already out there.
A few years ago I read James Howard Kunstler's <em>The Long
Emergency: Surviving the Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First
Century</em>, and I briefly revisited it. Then as now, it left me more
scared than prepared. The book mainly discusses what's going to
go horribly wrong. The last chapter deals with how we might manage
the process, but it's mainly prognostication and very little advice.</p>
<p>However, <strong><em>When All Hell Breaks Loose: Stuff You Need to Survive When 
Disaster Strikes</em></strong> <strong>by Cody Lundin</strong> is rich in advice on how to
survive a week or a few months without the modern conveniences we
take for granted. </p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts: "Head Candy" 
and "Hand Candy". Head Candy covers a wide range of philosophical, 
psychological, and physiological concerns, including posttraumatic 
stress disorder, consensus decision making, the power of gratitude, 
the importance of positive thinking. . . . Plenty of the material is
valuable, such as the importance of continuing to communicate
with your family, recognizing the signs of excess stress in 
others, and the impact of fear on physical function, but there's
plenty that could be left out too. There's a lot of woo-woo stuff
about thinking positive, and putting good vibes into the universe to
get good stuff back.</p>
<p>You're 84 pages into the book
before you get into the nitty-gritty of what you're gonna need
and how much of it.  That's the Hand Candy section, each 
chapter of which covers a
particular need: shelter, water, food, sewage
disposal, hygiene, light, heat for cooking, first-aid, self-defense,
communication, transport, and how to get out if you have to.<br />
Although the book is written in a light-hearted, humourous way, 
Lundin doesn't
talk down to his readers: each chapter starts with a technical description
of the matter at hand. For example, in the food chapter Lundin 
discusses the
different sources of calories (protein, fat and carbs) and how the 
body metabolizes each one.  He also devotes a page to explaining
the Glycemic Index, two to calculating your Basal Metabolic Rate, 
and three on an overview of Great Food Shortages in History, most
of which resulted in people eating each other (just in case you
weren't sure whether you wanted to store some food).  The light
section has two pages on the history of artificial lighting and
a one-page primer on batteries. And so on.</p>
<p>I would call this book over-written. Or maybe under-edited. Personally,
I love all this information, but then I thrive on non-fiction. 
I'm not sure that the average reader wants this much background 
in a book of this nature. However, if you can get through all 
the extra stuff, the advice in here is gold. Lundin has years 
of hands-on experience
living off the grid, living in the wild and leading survival 
courses. The book is rich with anecdotes and advice direct from 
experience, and when Lundin doesn't know something and couldn't
find it out, he's blunt about it. (Like, how long does whole
wheat keep anyway?)  He is pragmatic and considerate of 
all your family members&mdash;for example, a couple of times he
specifically addresses the needs of obese people without
being judgemental.</p>
<p>I took copious notes while reading this
book, and I now have a very long list of things to do and buy. Once
I've done them all I will feel much more prepared in the event of
something going horribly wrong for quite a long time.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you should think that planning for a long-term
failure of some or most of our infrastructure is paranoid, you
might not know that the CDC's worse-case scenario pandemic
plan involves the general public staying home for up to three
months. Or maybe a <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16400-major-solar-storm-could-cause-lasting-damage.html">solar storm</a> will knock
out the power grid indefinitely. The fact is I'd rather be 
ready and wrong.</p>
