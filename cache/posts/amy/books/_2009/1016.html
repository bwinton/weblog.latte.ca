<p>I took out <strong><em>Understanding Your 6 Year-Old</em></strong> <strong>by Deborah Steiner</strong> in
an attempt to understand my six-year-old, and it worked pretty well.
Six-year-olds are in a horrible state: they realize they're not
good at everything, they realize other people don't always like them,
they realize other people's lives are different (and sometimes
better) than their own, and on top of all that they realize that
Mum isn't infallible. It's too much. No wonder they're so crabby.
Reading this book helped me understand Delphine's perspective.</p>
<p>This is an English book translated for an American audience. I hate
it when they do that, nominally because it's patronising to 
Americans to assume they can't understand Anglicisms, but in
truth probably because I'm an Anglophile and I think (irrationally)
that English
English is better than American English. Anyway, either it's
impossible to completely Americanize a book like this, or they
did a lousy job because right from the first paragraph when she
talked about "infant's school" I knew it was an English book,
so all the Americanisms they did manage to slip in came off as 
glaring incongruities. Goodness knows what it would have been like
to read as a unilingual American; very disquieting, I imagine.</p>

<p>The September 16 issue of New Scientist magazine had a section
on science fiction, guest edited by Kim Stanley Robinson.
Robinson said, "the range, depth, intensity, wit and beauty 
of the science fiction being published in the UK these days 
is simply amazing", so I thought, hey, I used to love science
fiction, I should try it again. Sounds cool. </p>
<p><strong>Robert J. Sawyer</strong> is
a Toronto SF writer who gets some favourable press, so I
picked up his novel <strong><em>Rollback</em></strong>. It's about a woman who
initiated conversation with aliens in 2009. By the time
the aliens' reply reaches earth, the woman is in her eighties
and near death. A rich businessman offers to pay for a
"rollback" treatment for the woman, which will return her
to the health of a twenty-five year old. She accepts on the
condition that her husband gets the treatment, too. To say
more would spoil the plot, but there's romantic intrigue and
alien contact and tragedy and stuff. </p>
<p>Plot-wise it was a good
read, but I can't say it renewed my love of SF. I didn't
buy the premise that the only person who can continue to
communicate with the aliens is the person who started to. 
The writing
was no better than servicable&mdash;my bar for writing quality
has gone way up in the last few years.
The dialogue was lumpy; do writers not say their dialogue out
loud to see if it sounds like something anyone would ever say?
And there were some very awkward pop culture references which
were very clearly the author's own opinion, put into the mouth
of his characters: diatribes on TV shows, extensive discussion
about the Atkins diet, a Slashdot reference. The book was
published in 2007 and the near-future part was set in 2009,
and already the Atkins and Slashdot references were painfully
anachronistic. The world changes so fast that writing 
near-future SF is playing with fire. (Although I'm not sure 
that any astrophysics professors were reading Slashdot even in 
2007. I could be wrong; I stopped reading Slashdot in 2003.)</p>
<p>The characters were likeable and believable, the plot was 
interesting and kept me turning pages, and there were some 
interesting ideas presented about aging, and fidelity. But if
this is the best the SF has to offer (and Sawyer does keep
winning SF awards) I'm not surprised that SF writers don't win
any "literary" awards. But I'm not giving up yet&mdash;Kim
Stanley Robinson talked about UK SF writers, so I will read
some of his recommendations, and my brother (who loves
the same kind of writing that I do, Salman Rushdie and Kazuo
Ishiguro and Khaled Hosseini) likes the writing of Charles
Stross, so I will read him too.</p>
<p>Speak of the devil (hah!), my next read was <strong><em>Haroun and 
the Sea of Stories</em></strong> <strong>by Salman Rushdie</strong>, which I read
for Book Club. I thought it was great, nice and light with
a million references (pop culture and otherwise) to pick up,
and a nice rich allegory to mull over when the book is done.
(Okay, am I the only person who thinks "Butt the Hoopoe" is
a "Mott the Hoople" reference? It could be!) This book
manages to be both light and richly complex, like
some kind of light but richly complex wine. (That's what you
call the Trivial Metaphor.)</p>
<p>Before I read <strong><em>Keep it Real: Everything You Need to Know 
About Researching and Writing Creative Nonfiction</em></strong> <strong>edited 
by Lee Gutkind</strong> I didn't know what Creative Nonfiction was,
and I'm not entirely sure I know now, but I think I read
quite a lot of it. It seems to refer to those books and
magazine articles which
take a nonfiction topic and write about it in a literary
way, like Mary Roach's books about sex and corpses, or 
<em>The Perfect Storm</em> by Sebastian Junger. This book is a
collection of short (very short, a page or two) chapters
about various topics relevant to writing Creative Nonfiction:
research, composite characters, libel, fact-checking, quotation
marks, etc. That the chapters are arranged alphabetically brings
a certain randomness to the book, but each chapter is 
clearly self-contained and there isn't much repetition.
The shortness of the chapters keeps it interesting, resulting
in a quick, easy, but very informative read.</p>
