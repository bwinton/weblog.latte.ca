<p>Another year, another giant stack of books. Here's how it all boiled
down in ought-nine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Total books read: 66</li>
<li>Adult Novels: 16, of which six mysteries, and six for the book club.</li>
<li>Young Adult Novels: 4, two of which by Kit Pearson</li>
<li>Non-Fiction: 42, of which:<ul>
<li>9 books about writing;</li>
<li>6 books about parenting;</li>
<li>16 how-to and self-help (or psychology) books;</li>
<li>leaving 11 others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Memoir: 5, three by Bill Bryson</li>
<li>CanCon: 12<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>I felt like I wasn't reading much this year, and I was right. Further, it
wasn't my most profoundly intellectual of reading years. I only
read four adult non-mystery novels of my own accord (the rest were for
the book club). I read
a bunch of non-fiction books, but plenty of them were "how to decorate" or 
"how to garden"-type books. </p>
<p>Interesting that I read three more books about writing than I did about
parenting. I guess I'm getting pretty confident about the latter, but 
still petrified to take the plunge into the former.</p>
<p>Here are some standout books, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pictures of Perfection</em> by Reginald Hill is a beautifully written
mystery.</li>
<li><em>A Handful of Time</em> and <em>A Perfect, Gentle Knight</em> by Kit Pearson
both made me cry, as did</li>
<li><em>Elijah of Buxton</em> by Christopher Paul Curtis</li>
<li><em>Free-Range Kids</em> by Lenore Skenazy and <em>Unconditional Parenting</em> by 
Alfie Kohn pushed me to raise my parenting game</li>
<li><em>Dead Men Do Tell Tales</em> by William R. Maples and Michael Browning
was surprisingly profound and yet also provided me with lots of
gross anecdotes for cocktail parties.</li>
<li>I called <em>Everyday Survival</em> by Laurence Gonzales as one the best
of the year back in January when I read it, and I was right. It's
astonishing in its depth and breadth, and the way Gonzales brings
it all together is breathtaking. In fact, I can hardly believe it
was so good&mdash;I'm going to have to read it again and see.</li>
<li>And a special mention to <em>Getting Started As A Freelance Writer</em> 
by Robert Bly for planting the seed of the idea that I might be
able to earn a living at this thing I do for fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next year I'm going to try and clear out at least half of the 
two feet of my to-be-read shelf before the end of May. I'm going
to try and read more novels, and I'm going to strive, as always,
to be a more attentive and thoughtful reader.</p>
