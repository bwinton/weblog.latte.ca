<p>OMG, look at this! I was going to write a book blog post and
here I find this half-finished book blog post. So I'm just going to
finish this up and post it, and then I will work on blogging the eighteen
thousand books I've read since I wrote this.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><em>Twelve Books That Changed the World</em></strong> <strong>by Melvyn Bragg</strong> is
a book that doesn't need much introduction. I believe it's a
tie-in book to a TV series, the kind of TV series that could
only be produced in England. The books range from the
St James Bible to Mary Woolstonecraft's <em>A Vindication of the 
Rights of Woman</em> and, curiously, <em>Rules of Association
Football</em>. Each book is given its place in history, and as
such this book is an excellent cheat sheet for someone whose
education in history is lacking.</p>
<p><strong><em>Further Under the Duvet</em></strong> <strong>by Marian Keyes</strong> was recommended
to me by someone on Twitter (I think it was 
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/flossieteacake">FlossieTeacake</a>)
after a discussion of villa-itis, or the fear that you are going
to run out of bread while staying at a French villa. The book
is a collection of essays and short stories. Keyes is an Irish
writer with the most extraordinary Cinderalla story of going
from abject alcoholism to fame and riches as a writer. The story
is told in the book, along with essays on the joy of writing
a makeup column (free samples!), air-guitar championships, shopping
and plenty of chocolate. Funny and sweet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Positive Discipline</em></strong> <strong>by Dr. Jane Nelsen</strong> is yet
another positive/democratic/whatever parenting book. I don't know
why I keep reading them, since I more-or-less know what I'm doing
by now, but it's good to be reminded, and I do pick up different
ideas from the various books. This particular book reminded me
of the importance of family meetings, and reassured me that some
problems (namely chores) will have to be revisited at regular
intervals but are still worth handling democratically. I wouldn't
call this my favourite democratic parenting book&mdash;it's just
not funny enough. But it's worth a look if you need a refresher
(or an introduction to positive parenting) or if you want a new
angle.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Gargoyle</em></strong> <strong>by Andrew Davidson</strong> is our first book club book
of the year, and already this year's book club selection is looking better
than last year's. <em>The Gargoyle</em> is about a man who gets terribly
burned in a car crash, then meets a mysterious woman with a
bizarre past while he's recovering. It's about love and redemption
and all that good stuff, with a big dose of history. It's beautifully
written and I didn't want it to end.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right</em></strong> <strong>by Atul Gawande</strong>.
I have long been a fan of the checklist. I like to-do lists to keep
my days focused, I like lists of things to take places, I like
to record our daily routines in list form so nothing is forgotten.
This book is the validation for my checklist habit: Gawande writes
about how checklists can improve the outcome of extremely complex
projects, such as construction projects, and surgeries. Checklists
are already in use in construction and aviation, and the book centres
on Gawande and his team's attempt to create a checklist to reduce
the number of fatalities as a result of surgeries. It's not a smooth
path, but along the way we learn the kinds of checklists (DO-CONFIRM
and READ-DO), what makes a good checklist (not too much information,
easy to read), what makes a bad checklist (too long), and the
mind-boggling difference that a checklist can make in a process that
everyone involved feels is already going pretty well. (Gawande
uses his own checklist, and at first he thought it wouldn't make
much difference to <em>his</em> outcomes. As it turns out, not a week
goes by that the checklist doesn't catch something he would have
missed, and it has even saved at least one life on his watch).</p>
<p>As usual, Gawande is engaging and convincing. This was a great
read as well as a confirmation (and refinement) of my love for
checklists.</p>
