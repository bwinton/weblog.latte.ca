<p>A conversation with <a href="http://northtomom.blogspot.com/">North
TO Mom</a> reminded me that I read <strong><em>Manhood For Amateurs: The Pleasures 
and Regrets of a Husband, Father, and Son</em></strong> <strong>by Michael Chabon</strong> in 2010. Well,
I didn't actually read it, I listened to it while I was out walking this
summer. It's
read by the author, and it was a nice listen &mdash; I like Chabon's
voice and his accent and pronounciation was just different enough to
add interest. The content was good too: a collection of essays about
fatherhood (and a great one about motherhood), his brother and his
kids, and his life before marriage and children. I especially liked
the essay about Hanukkah and Christmas &mdash; it's basically something
I meant to write, but of course now it's been done a thousand times better
so I don't have to bother.</p>
<p>My last completed book of 2010 was a good one, too: <strong><em>A Prayer for
Owen Meany</em></strong> <strong>by John Irving</strong>. If you haven't read it, it's the
story of an odd New England boy who believes he is God's instrument.
The blurb on the back of the book says "He is." but I'm pretty sure 
the reader is free to make her mind up on that matter herself. It's
a lovely story (with lots of unexpected Toronto content - Forest Hill,
no less) with great, interesting but plausible (or at least, compelling)
characters.</p>
<p>Here's to 2011 &mdash; let's hope I book blog more often!</p>
