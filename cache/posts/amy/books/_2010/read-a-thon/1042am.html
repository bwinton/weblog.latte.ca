<p>I've been reading for two hours and forty-two minutes. I finished
<em>Moses in Egypt</em> by Lynne Reid Banks, and am on page 68
of Stephen King's <em>On Writing</em> &ndash; he's just started working
on <em>Carrie</em>.</p>
<p>So far I've read at the breakfast table, in the living room, in
the bathroom while Cordelia was taking a bath, while walking
Delphine to piano lessons and back, and on the piano teacher's porch.</p>
<p>Don't forget you can sponsor my readathon by donating to Books
for Africa on my
