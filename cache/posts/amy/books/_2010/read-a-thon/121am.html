<p>It's late. Not quite late enough to be early, but later than I usually
stay up when there isn't karaoke involved. </p>
<p>I finished <em>Raincloud</em>
by Richard S. Todd (and a pot of coffee) and the book was good (the
coffee was good too). There
were a few things I would have changed &ndash; characters knowing stuff
they shouldn't have known, weird word choices, and so on, but generally
it was good. The problems would have been caught by a good editor, and
after some investigation I see why they weren't: I took a closer look 
at the "publisher" after I finished
the book and it's iUniverse, which is a self-publisher. For a self-published
book this is actually really good, and I'm not sure why the author
didn't shop it around to a proper publisher.</p>
<p>Now I'm in that half-tired twilight you get when you're
up late under the influence of coffee. I'm going to head to bed with
another book and my itty bitty book light, and read until I fall asleep.
The alarm goes off at 7, so I'll try and wake up then and read a little
bit more before it all ends at 8 am.</p>
