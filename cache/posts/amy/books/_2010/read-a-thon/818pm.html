<p>I just finished reading the girls their bedtime books: <em>Oh,
The Places You'll Go</em> by Dr Suess for Cordelia and almost a
chapter (the one where he gets the <em>Bootle-Bumtrinket</em>) of
<em>My Family and Other Animals</em> by Gerald Durrell to Delphine.</p>

<p>Tanya brought her kids over to play with my kids, and while she
was here she documented the read-a-thon in pen and ink.  Blake 
is in the background cuddled up under a blanket because we
were sitting in the backyard and the sun was going down.</p>
<p>I'm almost halfway through <em>Raincloud</em> by Richard S. Todd,
which is better than I expected it to be. It's a mystery set
in a small town near a First Nations reserve: a series of
Native people have been found beaten and left for dead. It shouldn't
be too hard to finish.</p>
<p>But we're approaching the challenging part of the read-a-thon
for me: staying awake. I love sleep. Specifically I love eight hours
of sleep, and I haven't pulled an all-nighter since university.
I don't expect to pull an all-nighter tonight, but I'm worried that if
I time it wrong I will go to sleep and not wake up until after 8 
tomorrow, thus missing the end of the 'thon. My plan is to stay
up late &ndash; maybe midnight or one (shut up, that is <em>so</em> late)
and then sleep on the couch for a couple of hours. Then I'll grab
a coffee or a Coke and read until 8 am, then try (probably in vain)
to sleep for a little while before resuming my regularly scheduled
Sunday.</p>
<p>We'll see how it turns out.</p>
