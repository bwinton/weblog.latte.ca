<p><a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/books/_2010/read-a-thon.html">As 
I mentioned</a> a couple of weeks ago, I signed up for 
<a href="http://24hourreadathon.com/">Dewey's 24-Hour Read-a-Thon</a>.
I signed up, and then promptly forgot about it until earlier this week when I
kinda vaguely thought, "Hey, isn't that soon?"</p>
<p>It's this weekend. Fortunately there's not much preparation required.
I set up a <a href="http://www.firstgiving.com/amyrhoda">fundraising
page</a> on the amazing FirstGiving site to raise money for 
<a href="http://www.booksforafrica.org/">Books for Africa</a>. (I
already raised $145!)</p>
<p>And I picked a stack of books to read:</p>
<p><img src="/images/amy/books.jpg" alt="Books" align="center" /></p>
<p>I'm sure I won't get through all those, but I wanted to give myself
some variety so I can switch it up. (Blake suggested I just pick one
Neal Stephenson epic for the whole 'thon. No.)</p>
<p>So Stephen King's <em>On Writing</em>
because the last time I read it I came away feeling like I could be
a writer, in some crazy dreamland when I can do wacky things like
work with words and not hate my job &ndash; now that I'm living in that
world I want to revisit Mr King's writing on writing.</p>
<p><em>Wanting Mor</em> by Rukhsana Khan is a YA novel I bought with 
a gift card I got from
Delphine's teacher last year for being class mom. It's about a girl
in post-Taliban Afghanistan (does that even exist yet?) &ndash; that's
all I know but (like most novel readers, I suppose) I love to learn
about other lives and times and places through books.</p>
<p><em>Moses in Egypt</em> by Lynne Reid Banks is based on the movie
<em>Prince of Egypt</em>, one of my favourite animated movies,
and the Book of Exodus. I've
already started it and am enjoying it so far, although the prose 
doesn't have the fluid luminosity of the movie.</p>
<p><em>Heat</em> by George Monbiot is a fairly old climate change book, 
but I feel I should read it to have a more complete understanding of the
issue.</p>
<p><em>Raincloud</em> by Richard S. Todd is a wildcard &ndash; it's 
by a work associate of my father-in-law. It's a mystery set
in Ontario. Maybe it's awesome? I will report back.</p>
<p>I have a few other books on my TBR shelf if I get through/sick of all
those. I'll be blogging or Facebooking or otherwise updating my
status online as I go.</p>
