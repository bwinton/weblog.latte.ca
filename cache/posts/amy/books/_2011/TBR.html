<p>Last year I made some kind of resolution about reading half the books on my To
Be Read shelf. Our bookshelf (it's a 5 by 5 <a
href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/80156281">Expedit</a>, which
they apparently don't make anymore) has little squares, and right now my TBR
pile is taking up two cubbies. I wanted to reduce it to one, but somehow the
size of my TBR pile remains constant.</p>
<p>Like everyone, I imagine, I tend to avoid particular books. Various reasons:
maybe a book seems hard, maybe it's one I feel I "should" read but don't
actually want to, maybe I'm just never in the mood. Anyway, I find that some
books lurk in the TBR shelf for months and years while some just disappear
within weeks.  This year I decided to steel myself and tackle the shelf
alphabetically.</p>
<p><br clear="both"/></p>
<p>So here it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atwood, Margaret: <em>Moral Disorder</em> (my mother sent me this)</li>
<li>Conrad, Joseph: <em>Lord Jim</em> (this is a "should" read)</li>
<li>Didion, Joan: <em>The Year of Magical Thinking</em></li>
<li>Faber, Adele and Elaine Mazlich: <em>Siblings Without Rivalry</em> (a 
  necessary re-read)</li>
<li>Frey, Stephen: <em>The Power Broker</em></li>
<li>Gardiner, John Reynolds: <em>Stone Fox</em> (Delphine recommended this)</li>
<li>Goldreich, Gloria: <em>Open Doors</em> (my mother sent this too)</li>
<li>Grenville, Kate: <em>The Idea of Perfection</em></li>
<li>Harris, Marvin: <em>Cannibals and Kings</em> (I picked this up at someone's curb;
  it seems thinky and interesting but maybe totally dated.)</li>
<li>Hawking, Stephen: <em>George's Secret Key to the Universe</em> (I borrowed this
  from a friend; I'm interested in it in theory but the cover is so tacky
  it's putting me off.)</li>
<li>Hegi, Ursula: <em>Stones from the River</em></li>
<li>Hochschild, Adam: <em>Bury the Chains</em> (I got this as a gift from 
  <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/">Greg Wilson</a>. It's about
  the dismantlement (that is <em>so</em> a word) of slavery.)</li>
<li>Khan, Rukhsana: <em>Wanting Mor</em></li>
<li>McCarthy, Cormac: <em>All The Pretty Horses</em> (Because I read <em>The Road</em>
  and I'm a huge masochist.)</li>
<li>McLaren, Leah: <em>The Continuity Girl</em> (see above re: masochist)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/amy/books/tbr2.jpg" alt="To Be Read Shelf - 2" 
     align="right" /></p>
<ul>
<li>McLaughlin, Emma and Nicola Krause: <em>The Nanny Diaries</em> (A friend
  swears this is better than it looks.) </li>
<li>McDonough, William and Michael Braungart: <em>Cradle to Cradle</em> (This is
  a book about sustainable design which I'm halfway through and can't finish.
  It's just so dry. I'm going to give it one more effort.)</li>
<li>Monbiot, George: <em>Heat</em></li>
<li>Munro, Alice: <em>The View from Castle Rock</em> (My mother sent me this, too.
  She <em>loves</em> Alice Munro and thinks we should read this in book
  club.)</li>
<li>Nemirovsky, Irene: <em>Suite Francaise</em></li>
<li>Ondaatje, Michael: <em>The English Patient</em> (My friend who liked <em>The Nanny
  Diaries</em> hates this book but I have another friend who loves it, so I just
  don't know what to think. I guess I'll have to read it and judge for myself.)</li>
<li>Petroski, Henry: <em>The Evolution of Useful Things</em> (This is another one I've
  started but got bogged down with. I want to like it, though; the subject
  matter is interesting.)</li>
<li>Ritter, Erika: <em>The Dog By the Cradle, the Serpent Beneath</em> (This is a book
  that I was interested in, so I grabbed it at a book sale or off the curb
  or something.)</li>
<li>Sebold, Alice: <em>The Lovely Bones</em></li>
<li>Stross, Charles: <em>Iron Sunrise</em> (A while ago I said I wanted to start
  reading sf again, but I made a horrible misstep (in my earnest search for 
  CanCon) and read a Robert Sawyer book. I still haven't recovered, but I
  hope this book will bring me back into the fold.)</li>
<li>Weatherford, Jack: <em>Indian Givers: How the Indians of the Americas 
  Transformed the World</em> (This is the Indian version of that book about how
  the Scots are responsible for everything cool ever. Maybe I will read them
  both and declare a winner.)</li>
<li>Zinnser, William: <em>On Writing Well</em></li>
<li>Blume, Judy: <em>Summer Sisters</em></li>
</ul>
<p>(The last thing on that shelf is the choral score to Mendelssohn's <em>Elijah</em>,
which we are performing this spring. I just put it there to have it handy
when we start rehearsing at the end of this month.)</p>
<p>There are a couple of rules. You'll see that the Judy Blume book is out
of order: that's my wild card. If I just can't face the next book on
the list, I get to read <em>Summer Sisters</em>. It's my only wild card, so
I have to use it wisely.</p>
<p>Also I can interrupt the sequence at any time for library books, book club
books, or books which need to be read right away for another reason, like
how-to books.</p>
<p>Let's see how far through the alphabet I get this year.</p>
