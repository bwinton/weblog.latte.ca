<p>The second book I read this year was the book for our first book club meeting.
<strong><em>The Things They Carried</em></strong> <strong>by Tim O'Brien</strong> is a collection of stories
about the Vietnam war, and coming home from the Vietnam war. (And trying to
avoid <em>going</em> to the Vietnam war.) It's also about storytelling, cameraderie, 
belonging, and the slippery morality of war.</p>
<p>The book club had an interesting variety of reactions to this book. 
One of us said she couldn't relate to any of the characters in the book
on account of them being men, but that she really enjoyed the writing.
I thought the writing was compelling but I didn't really <em>notice</em> it.
Which would normally be a good thing, but I feel like I should notice
writing, pay attention to it, so I can improve my own writing. I guess
that's what the second reading is for, but I'm too impatient to read anything
twice. Something to work on.</p>
<p>Another book club member thought she didn't like it, but in retrospect realized
that she liked that one part... and the other chapter... and that bit about...
actually it was really sticking with her and that must be good. It's that kind
of book &mdash; you may not enjoy reading it but it gives you lots of things to
think about. I liked it &mdash; the characters were compelling, and I liked the
ideas and questions it raised, especially the question of the difference
between a true story, and something that really happened.</p>
