<p>I love this Christmas holiday, you know why? I'll tell you: because
Christmas was on Saturday. Two weeks off, Christmas on Saturday, means
you get a week to get ready for Christmas and a week to recover.</p>
<p>Boxing Day was spent as follows: we went up to Yonge
and Eglinton to shop &mdash; Blake tried and failed to buy me
<em>Life</em> (with David Attenborough) on Blu-Ray, and I was more successful
with my shopping, a picture frame and a tablecloth. Then we had
dim sum at Cha Liu, and Delphine and I walked back home (stopping
to see Charlie on the way). Delphine had Ursa over
to show off her loot, and then we sent all the girls over to Ursa's
house while Blake and I went on a grocery date and got some things
set up around the house.</p>
<p>After groceries we rendezvoused at Ursa's house and pooled our leftovers for an
awesome post-Christmas Christmas dinner: our beef and potatoes, pudding,
cookies, and wine; their turkey, wild rice, (more) potatoes.</p>
<p>But this post isn't even about Boxing Day, which was yesterday &mdash;
it's about today! The girls have big ambitions for this week: they want
to go up the CN Tower, they want to go to the ROM <em>and</em> they want to go
to the Science Centre. Since today was forecast to be the only clear day 
this week I decided we should go up the Tower today.</p>
<p>The Tower was great. Lots of lining up, sure, but then an excellent elevator 
ride and a fun view of the city. ("Oh, there's that thing! Oh, there's that 
other thing!") Then down to the glass floor (after rejecting the cafe as a lunch
option &mdash; $17 hamburger!) which the girls loved and I walked on
only under extreme duress. Horrifying. </p>
<p>(Later on the way home, Delphine said she was not so impressed about 
the Tower, but I think she had a good time when she was up there.
It's a good thing to have done.)</p>
<p>The elevator down deposited us conveniently in the
gift store. Cordelia's whole plan for this trip was to get a little CN Tower
(I think her friend Zoey has one) so we got her one. Since Cordelia
was getting something, Delphine had to as well, so she got a doodad and
I bought myself a pair of souvenir earrings.</p>
<p>We had lunch at East Side Mario's, first regaling our children with boring
stories about how we used to go to ESM when we were in university.
It was still great: little loaves of soft white bread, big bowls
of salad (same as before except no pickled peppers) and giant servings
of pasta. (Cordelia: "Why did she give me so much?!") We all ate half
our meals, and the girls got three tiny ice cream cones for dessert. The
whole place is designed to bring families back: great kids menu, crayons
and activity books, gorgeous bathroom (panelled wood cubicles!),
delightful kids' dessert, a little toy, and take-home cups with characters
on to make sure the kids never forget. <em>And</em>, since it was Monday the
kids ate for free. ESM, for every stage of your life.</p>
<p>After lunch we walked down to the Harbourfront and met some friends
to go skating. It was our first time this year, so it took me a lap or
two to get steady. Cordelia never really stopped hanging on to someone
and dragging, but Delphine was quite confident on her skates by the end.</p>
<p>When we were all quite frozen we went back up to Colleen and Jeff's (they
live right opposite the rink, lucky buggers) for hot chocolate and ended
up playing Wii games and staying for pizza.</p>
<p>Then home and to bed with the children, late again! We're going to
spend tomorrow at home so as to not overwhelm ourselves with excitement.
Also to clean up after Christmas Day &mdash; I still haven't recycled
the giftwrap.</p>
<p>We had such a lovely day, and yesterday to. I love going out with the
girls, they're so agreeable and interested and interesting. I love 
sharing the city with them, discovering and rediscovering what makes
it such a wonderful place to live.</p>
