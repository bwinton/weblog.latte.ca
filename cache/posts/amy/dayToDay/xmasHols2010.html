<p>We took a day off from awesomeness on Tuesday, but on Wednesday we
were back at it with a visit to the Science Centre. (We're members
there, so the day only cost us about $45 for food and transit.) We
saw an exhibit about the Aga Khan Ismaili Museum, which is under
construction just up the road from the Science Centre, we saw
a demonstration about fire and explosions, we visited the rainforest
(Delphine's favourite) and that hallway with all the soundproofing
that's really quiet and makes you feel like your head is full of
cotton wool &mdash; that's <em>my</em> favourite. We also went through 
a terrific exhibit about mythical
creatures and the real-life phenomena which might have inspired them.
Did you know there used to be a giant prehistoric ape in China? Delphine's
favourite part of that exhibit was a poster about a boy who loves
Pok&eacute;mon. That seems like a weird thing to have in a show about
mythical creatures, but I think their points were that some Pok&eacute;mon
monsters are inspired by mythical creatures, and that Pok&eacute;mon
are kind of their own mythology.</p>
<p>On Thursday we went down to the ROM, where we also have a membership.
We saw the special exhibit on the Terracotta Warriors, which was 
nicely done. I'm sure I would have learned something if the show
hadn't been crowded with everyone else in Ontario who decided to put off
visiting it until the last week. Even so, it was impressive and
well-organized.</p>
<p>We accidentally saw an exhibit of art by an African artist who uses
found objects to make beautiful flowing sculptures. (Accidentally
because we took the elevator up to the upstairs (fancy) restaurant to
see what was up there, and then came down the stairs which deposited us
into the exhibit.) The girls weren't
really interested, except they thought it was neat that the sculptures
were made of bottle caps and things. From there we stopped into the
Textiles area, which I think is fascinating but the girls were
bored by. Some of the little clothes held their interest for a while,
especially the little yellow boy's dress. But there weren't any
garments in their sizes: everything on display was either toddler size
or adult size. I pointed out that Delphine was almost big enough to
wear the adult dresses &mdash; people really were tiny back then.</p>
<p>We also spent our usual time in the Bat Cave, and in the hands-on
kids' area. (My favourite thing is the super microscope hooked up to
a TV &mdash; I like to use it to magnify my flaking, cracked cuticles and
gross myself and the girls out.) </p>
<p>We had lunch at the ROM, in the basement cafe, and as usual it was
cheap and delicious. We got a pizza, a burger, chili, poutine, and a
smoked pork burrito, plus a brownie and a nanaimo bar, for $32. I
would go there for lunch all the time if I worked nearby; they 
have more grown-up food than pizza and burgers, and it's all locally 
sourced and freshly made.</p>
<p>Thursday night we had our neighbours over for a drink &mdash; I had
invited them to our Christmas Carol Jam but they were too sick, so
this was their make-up drink. We chatted about New Year's Eve plans, 
and they said they were having some people for dinner and to play
a karaoke game on their Nintendo. When I expressed my unholy love
for karaoke they invited me over, so that's how I ended up going
to my neighbours' at 12:10 am on January 1st (leaving Blake at home
with the girls because he's so not into karaoke). They and their friends 
were friendly and welcoming, and I had a terrific time. I might have
kicked some karaoke ass, too, even though the game is weird and picks the
songs for you. I was out until 3:30, which is unheard of, and didn't
fall asleep until 4:00. I might have been a teeny bit drunk, too. Not
as drunk as my neighbours, though; it was like a university party!</p>
<p>Today, thankfully, was an easy day. In between catching up on sleep I
did laundry and moved things around. Tomorrow we'll move
things around some more, and go skating, and then out for Sunday
Family Dinner, and then they holiday is over and everything goes back to
normal.  I'm not quite ready
for this holiday to be over, but I'm excited about 2011 and the new things
it will bring. Happy New Year!</p>
