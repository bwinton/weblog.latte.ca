In the past, as you have been unfortunate enough to witness, 
I have been miserable about my life, feeling like it's not going
anywhere or I'm not doing good enough or I'm not achieving anything or
whatever.  Recently, however, that feeling has subsided.  I'm feeling
mellow, like whatever needs doing will get done, and I'll be able to
deal with stuff as it comes up, and I'm not a big loser.  It's
refreshing!
</p><p>
To what do I attribute this change?  If only I knew.  But I'm working on
a theory that it has something to do with all the 
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/~arbrown/reading.html">books</a> 
I've been reading lately,
really good books about normal people living their normal lives.  Like
<em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</em> and 
<em>Captain Corelli's Mandolin</em> and <em>Clare Callan</em>
and <em>The Brothers K</em>.  I don't have a lot more to this theory,
other than that maybe reading all these books has made me pull my 
head out
of my own ass and think about other people instead of just sitting around
worrying about my own "problems".  
</p><p>
I also haven't read any parenting advice books lately, I bet that helps.
There's nothing that makes you think your life is so significant than
reading a book all about what's wrong with it and what you have to do to
make it better.

By the way, the reason for all these books is that I finally got off my
ass (actually got <em>on</em> my ass) and figured out how to use the 
Toronto Public Library inter-library loan system on the Internet.  Now
I barely have to do more than think "Huh, I'd like to read that book", and
I get a call from a nice recorded lady telling me that the book is 
waiting for me at my local branch.  It's amazing, except that
<em>About a Boy</em>, <em>Due Preparations
for the Plague</em>, <em>The Diary of Samuel Pepys</em>, <em>A Fine
Balance</em>, and <em>Quicksilver</em> <strong>all</strong> arrived
at the same time, just after I had taken out <em>The Brothers K</em>.
That's almost 3500 pages of book.  Good thing I also know how to renew over
the Internet.
