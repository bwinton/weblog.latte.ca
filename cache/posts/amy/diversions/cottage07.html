The girls and I just got back from a week at the cottage — Blake
was there for the first few days but he had to come back for work
mid-week.  We stayed a full week and had a great time.
</p>
<p>
We stayed on the same beach as last year, but in a different
cottage; this one was further up the beach on a rockier bit,
which meant we had to trek down the road a ways to get to 
the sandy swimming beach.  The beach we were on, though — the
backyard of the cottage— had a sandy part for sitting and
reading or digging in,
and also lots of rocks for climbing and collecting and sliding on,
so it was by no means a disaster.
</p>
<p>
The cottage had two bedrooms on the main floor and another
double bed and single bed up in the loft, a little room 
amateurishly cobbled together in the rafters, accessible
by a ladder-like staircase.  Blake and I and Delphine slept
there for the first weekend; after Morgan and Erik and Blake
left the girls and I moved into one of the main floor bedrooms
and I got to experience the quiet but deep satisfaction of 
falling asleep to the sound of my children's breath.
</p>

The place was pretty cottagy; I don't understand this love
of wood panelling.  Nostalgia, I suppose.  Zaida went to
scope out a different cottage for next year.  It had been
freshly gutted and decorated with, you guessed it, wood
panelling.  Nice, new wood panelling.  
I would slap gallons of white paint around
if I had one of these places.  This cottage did have some
of the midcentury furnishings I favour; two beautiful
pairs of wood armchairs in a fine, elegant Danish style.
I couldn't get Blake to see past the orange vinyl on
one pair and green tweed on the other to appreciate their
airiness and elegantly tapered legs, though.
</p>
<p>
We spent a lot of time on the beach.  I stupidly got sunburned
twice but the girls weren't at all; they are just a little tan.
Delphine was a superstar in the water; by the end of the week
she was getting bowled over by waves and just picking herself
up and facing the next one.  Perhaps this is more interesting if
you know what a fraidy cat she normally is!  It's satisfying
to see her face her fears and enjoy herself.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia wasn't so hot on the water; I think she doesn't like
to be cold.  I have lots of pictures of her looking variously
forlorn, miserable, cranky and disgruntled on the beach.
(I will post pictures soon.)
Cordelia did have some fun playing with Zaida in the waves, but 
Zaida is extremely good at finding the fun for little people.
</p>
<p>
We ate well; barbecued ribs, burgers, chicken, and hot dogs; freshly
picked corn on the cob, watermelon, ice cream, new potatoes,
field tomatoes.  Beer.  Every day we tried to eat up the leftovers and 
every night the fridge was fuller than ever.
</p>
<p>
Baba and Zaida had some friends over on the last night we were
there, two couples.  Delphine was very apprehensive about meeting
them, but when I exhorted her to be brave she pulled herself
together and both girls were very nicely behaved and charming.
Another fear conquered!
Delphine took it upon herself to take care of Cordelia; when
Cordelia said she was done eating Delphine wiped her up with a
napkin, very officiously.  Delphine was also very happy to 
show the guests down
to the lake.  As a special bonus I
got to talk to adults about brainy things like computers and
books.  Hooray!  I need to make some new friends, or perhaps
just reaquaint myself with the friends I already have.
</p>
<p>
So another successful trip to the cottage, and Zaida already
has next year's cottage picked out.  We refine our requirements
every year; by 2015 we will have identified the perfect cottage.
