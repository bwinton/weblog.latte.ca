<p>Blake and I are watching the season 3 premier of <em>Burn Notice</em>
(hooray!) and I was trying to figure out who the management
guy in the helicopter was. </p>
<p>I said, "That's the dad from..."</p>
<p>Blake paused the show while I remembered.</p>
<p>"...from Frasier. I knew it was the dad from something. Cool."</p>
<p>Blake said, "He was also in <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>."</p>
<p>I frowned. "Really? Who was he?"</p>
<p>"Not really, but everyone else was."</p>
<p>"Yeah, <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> had the dad from <em>Danger Bay</em>."</p>
