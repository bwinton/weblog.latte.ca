<p>Back in 2007 we <a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/2007/0731/">had a new
deck built</a>, and to celebrate we threw a party and invited all our
coolest friends. It was an awesome party so we've done one every year
since, and this year's was today. Of course I forgot to take pictures
as usual, so don't hold your breath for the picture post.</p>
<p>We invited about 40 people (plus kids) to the first one, and the
number has increased every year since &ndash; this year we invited
about 75. Most of them didn't make it, though, and we
probably ended up with about 30 plus nine kids, a thirteen-month-old
and a six-week-old (Charlie!) So it wasn't the giant hoedown it
has been in the past, but on the other hand I managed to hang out
with everyone for at least a little while.</p>
<p>Blake thinks we broke even on beer; people always bring beer and we
seem to have the same amount now that we had this morning. We're also
up one pot of flowers and a jar of caramelized red onion relish (NOM!)
We also have piles of leftover party food: cheese, crackers, ketchup
chips (no-one likes ketchup chips!), and various frozen hors d'oeuvres.
That's what we'll be eating for the next couple of weeks &ndash; that
and Ontario peaches and apples.</p>
