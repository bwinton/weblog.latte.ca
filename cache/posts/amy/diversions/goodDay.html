Delphine and I had a good day yesterday.   It was sunny and warm, the
first real spring day of the year.  In the morning we went down to the
office to fix something, and then picked up some groceries on the way
home.  Lunch was ham sandwiches and coleslaw (Delphine picked out and ate
the ham and left the bread, so I finished hers) and then we had a nap
together on the couch, which might be my very favourite thing to do
in the whole world.

After the nap we collected ourself and went out for a walk, up to
the green grocer to get some lettuce for salad.  Because it was so
mild out we went at Delphine's pace instead of mine, so we climbed the
stairs at Starbucks, touched the flowers at the flower shop, walked
on the snow bank at Rogers, climbed the stairs at the bank about twenty 
times, and tried to get money out of the machine (I said she would have to
get a card, and a bank account, and a job first).  Then she was tired of
walking so I picked her up for the rest of the walk to the store.

At the green grocer she learned about mushrooms (she has learned to say
"what's that?" instead of "ga-duh?") and green beans ("noodle?"), and then
we walked back.  She decided to take a detour at the LCBO because they
have lots of good snow to walk on, and that took us to the school.
That was an excellent choice, because we were able to visit with the
kids and ladies at daycare, and then play in the extensive and deep
puddles in the school ground.  I had to drag her away from there after
at least half an hour of splashing, and by the time we got home our
trip to the green grocer had taken a couple of hours.

I cannot say enough about how much I enjoy her company these days.  I'm
so happy to have a verbal little kid instead of a baby, and I am 
astonished at how much personality she has, which apparently sprung
forth fully-formed.  I am finally starting to feel like I, as the 
stay-at-home parent, have the better side of the deal.
