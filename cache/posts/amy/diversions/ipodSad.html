For some reason I am feeling a bit melancholy this afternoon,
so I thought I would buck up and listen to some music and do
some housework.
</p>
<p>
First my iPod gave me "Why Worry" by Dire Straits, which is
kind of a bummer song anyway, and which reminds me of my brother
Dave (see above) who I miss these days.  Then came on "Song
for a Winter's Night" by Sarah McLachlan, which for some reason
always makes me really lonely for my mother, and I thought what
the hell, no-one's around, why not shed a few tears.  Then
that song ended and I thought good, that's enough gloom!  
What's next?

<p>
"Close Your Eyes", the Buffy and Angel theme from <em>Buffy
The Vampire Slayer</em>.  Kill me now.  With a big sword.
Even though you really love me.  It's for the good of the world.
