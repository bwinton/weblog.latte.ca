There are hardly any urban animals in Tokyo. I didn't see any wild mammals at
all (although I'm sure they have rats) and the only birds I saw were
crows and sparrows. There are cats around shrines because the monks
feed them.</p>

<p>When you go to a restaurant you get a little towel in a plastic bag.
Sometimes it's a disposable wet wipe, sometimes it's a little facecloth
(hot or cold). The catch is you don't get a napkin.</p>

<p><img src="/images/amy/japan/hydrangeas.jpg" align=left alt="hydrangeas growing by
the subway" />
There are hydrangeas everywhere; in parks and gardens, but also growing wild
by train tracks. I also spotted daylilies and hostas &mdash; it was cool to see my
garden friends in their native environment.</p>
<hr>
<p>July in Tokyo is really freaking hot. Really, and humid too. They don't
report a Humidex, which is good because it'd be up in the 40s and it would
make everyone feel worse. </p>

The good people of Tokyo don't suck it up and act all stoic, they hate it and
deal with it in a number of ways. Hand fans are very popular and no-one is shy
about using them &mdash; lots of companies give out fans as promotional material.
Everyone carries little <a
href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/schmatte">schmattes</a> to mop themselves
with. You can buy them all over the place.</p>
<p>A lot of ladies carry parasols. These are distinguished from umbrellas
by their eyelet lace edging. I assume if you are expecting rain and sun on
the same day you have to carry both devices.</p>

All the manhole covers are pretty, and they're different in every area.</p>
<hr>
<p>They have awesome transit in Tokyo. There are a bunch of different companies
which provide subway and train service, but they all work together 
seamlessly because they use the same payment card system. Yet again the TTC
looks like a bunch of bush league amateurs by comparison. (Not that they're
dealing with the same size user base. But still. They could suck less.)</p>

<p><img src="/images/amy/japan/sidewalkgarden.jpg" align=right alt="sidewalk garden" />
No-one in Tokyo has a garden so some people get their green thumb on by
creating sidewalk gardens; pots and planters on the sidewalk. I saw
a rosebush in one, and a little fish pond with water plants and actual
fish in another.</p>
<hr>
<p>Most restaurants serve meals as a collection of little dishes; instead of
ordering, say, steak which comes with veg and potatoes, you'd order a little
plate of steak, a little plate of veg and a little plate of potatoes.  And you
don't order everything up front, you order a few things, then add some more
stuff later if you're still hungry.  (You also share with everyone, so if you
don't feel like what everyone else feels like, you're screwed. Until dessert,
then everyone gets what they want.)</p>
<p>It's a great way to eat - you can order the right amount of food and
stop when you're full instead of being tempted to finish a big plateful.
And you can order the exactly kind of food you want and the restaurant
doesn't get to screw you by serving you a giant pile of cheap carbs and calling
it a deal.</p>

Some of the bathroom stalls have little child seats mounted on the wall 
for you to park your baby when you pee. I cannot tell you how much I 
wanted this feature when my kids were babies!</p>

<p><img src="/images/amy/japan/mangosoftserve.jpg" align=left alt="mango soft-serve

They have great softserve flavours. I don't know why we stick with 
chocolate and vanilla here, because mango-vanilla swirl is sublime.
I also spotted green tea and black sesame.</p>
<hr>
<p>Parks and playgrounds in Tokyo run the gamut from lame to non-existent.
They have a few big parks, but they're not big on lawns and greenspace.
I spotted a handful of playgrounds, but they all featured the same
monkey bars, two swings and a metal slide. I also didn't spot any children
at the playgrounds. I don't know if Japanese kids
play at private playgrounds, or if they just don't play at all and are at
organized activities.</p>
<hr>
<p>They have 24-hour karaoke. (<em>24-hour karaoke!!!</em>)</p>

Shoes in Japan are awesome. Okay, plenty of women wear boring shoes, but 
there are some amazing shoes worn just out and about. And the fancy shoe
ladies are dedicated to high heels.</p>
<p>To go with the shoes are lots of fancy sock options; some girls even wear 
socks with strappy sandals. They have sock configurations for every kind of
shoes; tiny socks with lace mary-jane straps and lace trim to wear with ballet
flats, socks with a split at the toe to wear with thong sandals, socks with
cut-out heels for...  when you feel like wearing socks with cut-out heels.
Socks in Japan have gone beyond their traditional role as foot/shoe protectors;
they augment the shoe.</p>
