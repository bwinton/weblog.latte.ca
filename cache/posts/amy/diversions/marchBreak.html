It's day three of March break, which I have been looking forward
to for a while.  As I might have mentioned a thousand times,
taking people to and from school is the thorn in my side for 
this winter, so a week of unstructured days where we don't have
to be anywhere in particular are any particular time sounds
awesome.  I'm also glad to say I haven't turned into one of
those Moms who is scared to face a week or even a day with
her kids.  (One of my favourite examples is an acquaintance
from school who has bought her kid millions of toys but "has"
to schedule her for activity after activity because she 
is "bored" at home.  My kids aren't allowed to be bored.)

So on Monday we had a friend of Delphine's over and they
did the usual dressing up and jumping on the bed and 
drawing pictures and stuff.  I threw together some 
lunch and then Delphine went over to the friend's house
while Cordelia napped and I ... I don't remember what
I did.  Read, maybe?

Tuesday we had a huge impromptu March Break Pizza Party.  
I had invited my friend Ellen over with her three, 
and my friend Tanya invited herself over (she's allowed
to do that) with her two, and she in turn mentioned
to a friend, Anna, that she was coming, and said friend
invited <em>her</em>self over (she's not really allowed
to do that but we have been muttering about getting
together sometime, and she's moving to England soon
so it's not like I need to worry about something awkward
developing.)  Anna has two boys, so altogether there
were nine children (two babies, three toddlers and
four kindergartners) and four Mummies.  We tossed 
the eldest out into the snow for a while where Jake
(the senior kindergartner) gave orders and pulled 
people around on the sled.  The Mums juggled babies
and made pizza and talked some awesome talk (I love
smart people) and then we hailed everyone in and fed
them all.  Then all the kids played upstairs.  It was
an interesting dynamic; they are all three and four and
I swear they spend eighty percent of the time discussing
what they were going to play and what the rules were
and whose rules they should use, and maybe twenty percent
of the time actually playing, usually chasing each other
and screaming.

Gradually people left (but not without cleaning the
kitchen first!) until it was just Tanya and me and ours,
and we agreed it was good fun but not something you'd want
to do every day.

Today I declared Toy Sort-Out day.  We brought every toy
in the house down to the dining room along with the assorted
boxes and bags and things they go in, and put everything
where it's supposed to be, creating new categories and 
boxes (with labels) as necessary.  I am trying to train 
them to be organized freaks like me.  It was hard work but
it only took the morning.  After lunch Delphine and I "rested"
on the couch (with the TV on) while DeeDee napped, and now 
they are outside painting the snow with food colouring-tinted
water, and making snow cookies with the sandbox toys I dug out.

Tomorrow we're venturing downtown to the Gardiner Museum of
Ceramic Arts, and Friday is still wide open!  Maybe we will go
tobogganing in the park.  What are you doing for March break?
