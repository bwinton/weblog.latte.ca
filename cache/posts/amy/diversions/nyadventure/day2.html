<p>While we were in New York we stayed at the comically-named <a
href="http://www.countryinns.com/long-island-city-hotel-ny-11101/nynyquee">Country
Inn &amp; Suites</a> in Queens. It's an incongruous 9-storey building in a slightly
seedy area which didn't seem to have much to offer (although we didn't explore)
apart from Queensboro Plaza station, from which it's a quick ride to westbound
to Manhattan or eastbound to all the cool stuff in Queens which you only know
about if you have friends in, say, Jackson Heights.</p>
<p>One of the most important features of a hotel is a free breakfast buffet, and
this one didn't disappoint. Well, I suppose if you were looking for
high-quality food it might disappoint, but considering the great price we got
for the room I wasn't expecting much. There were strange skinless sausage-like
objects, patties of that yellow foamy "egg", cheap bagels, danishes, doughnuts
and bread, coffee (or hot chocolate or hot water) out of a dispenser, and for
the health-minded, bananas and tubs of fat-free yoghurt. But the highlight
was the make-your-own waffle station: a dispenser oozed pre-made waffle batter
which was then poured onto an electric waffle iron. Two minutes later, uncanny
fluffy goodness. The girls and I had waffles and syrup for breakfast every day.
(There may have been some doughnut consumption as well.) The "sausages" were
savory and sagey, but the egg tasted like the cushion foam it resembled.</p>
<p>After carb-loading we walked down to the station to catch a train into
Manhattan. We bought two seven-day MTA Metrocards &mdash; that's right: two.
The girls rode the MTA all week for free! Not 60&cent;, not 75&cent;, but
absolutely free.  They got to duck under the turnstiles!  (Each adult gets to
take three children under 44" for free.)</p>
<p>Our first stop was Fifth Avenue, to visit F.A.O. Schwartz and then walk to
the Lego Store at Rockefeller Center. Before we got to F.A.O. Schwartz our
sight was arrested by the looming glass cube which heralds the Fifth
Avenue Apple Store. Well... it was right there; we <em>had</em> to go in! They had
the new iPads to play with, and I looked at docking stations for the bathroom
(shut up) and Delphine and Cordelia found games to play, but all in all
it didn't strike me as any cooler than any other Apple Store, apart from the
great glass elevator. The children wanted to stay and play video games all
day, but I impressed upon them the utter lameness of that idea and finally
dragged them out.</p>
<p>F.A.O. Schwartz turned out to be right next door to the Apple Store, and also
turned out to be closed (it was 9:30 am) so we walked down to the Lego Store,
admired Lego and made custom mini-figs for a while, then walked back (with a
Starbucks detour). F.A.O. Schwartz was big and toy-store-ish, and they had lots
of cool stuff there, but the lines they carry are pretty much the same as the
stuff at Mastermind, except more of everything and the occasional sales
guy/demonstrator. Delphine was swayed by one of the demonstrators, a sweetheart
shilling <a href="http://myachi.com/home.html">Myachis</a>. That's what she
spent her souvenir money on, and Cordelia bought some Playmobil.</p>
<p>Our next stop was the Second Avenue Deli, confusingly not found on Second
Avenue at all: it's the new location! There we met up with Sascha, my oldest
and bestest Internet friend and my excuse for the whole trip. We all had matzo
ball soup, Blake had a brisket sandwich, I had noodle kugel and Delphine had a
meatloaf sandwich. I don't think the matzo ball soup was as good as Baba's, and
I don't think the noodle kugel was as good as our family recipe, but they were
still very tasty. We took some rugelach and hamentashen to go and they turned
out to be delicious indeed.</p>
<p>The Second Avenue Deli was the site of my first kosher faux pas of the day:
I asked in great earnest whether Cordelia could have a glass of milk. If you're
paying attention, which clearly I was not, you will note that the Second
Avenue Deli is a <em>meat</em> restaurant and thus not likely to have handy gallons
of milk hanging around for thirsty five-year-olds. I'm pretty good with kosher
but I always forget about the meat/milk thing. As we shall see.</p>
<p>After lunch we proceeded apace (I'm trying to see how many ways I can say
"went") to the Central Park Zoo. We have a perfectly good zoo in Toronto but
it's miles and miles away and not easily reachable by transit, so we never go
&mdash; this would be the first time Cordelia had ever been to a zoo. The
Central Park Zoo is fairly teeny but the animals are all interesting: seals,
penguins, polar bears, tiny adorable tamarins (my favourites). The best thing
was the Tropic Zone, a building containing a rainforest stocked with a
breathtaking number of fantastic tropical birds. Everywhere you looked there
was another amazing bird.  (They said they had fruit bats too, but I didn't see
them.)</p>
<p>We also went to the Tisch's Children's Zoo, which was a fairly small collection
of the usual petting zoo critters, along with lots of interesting climable
sculptures and a giant spider web made of rope. The girls loved it but Blake
and I were freezing in our optimistic spring coats. It was one of those days
which are pleasantly warm when the sun shines and chilly and miserable when it
doesn't, and as the day wore on the sun's appearances became more infrequent.</p>
<p>We finally dragged the children away on the fairly slim premise of going to
Macy's to get Cordelia a pair of shoes. (The shoes we had packed for her were
woefully inadequate &mdash; they kept flying off when she ran because the
Velcro on the fake buckle was shot.) The Macy's turned out to be that store
with the cool wooden escalators, which we were on for a long time because the
kids' shoe department is on the seventh floor. We finally (not without some
testiness all around) found shoes which met my requirements for price and fit
and Cordelia's for sparkliness, and then set out in search of dinner.</p>
<p>Blake and I were in that horrible state where you're tired and hungry but
too grumpy to decide on a restaurant: everything looks too expensive,
too seedy, too weird or too chain-y. Finally after blocks of searching we
settled on <a
href="http://www.greatrestaurantsmag.com/KOSHER/restaurants/413/aroma-pizza-cafe">Mike's
Pizzeria</a> on 36th Street, a caf√©-style pizza place that looked clean and
nice. I ordered macaroni and cheese for the girls, smoked cheese and mushroom
pizza for me, and Blake got a slice of thick-crust plain cheese pizza. When we
got to the table it came to pass that Delphine didn't want macaroni and
cheese, she wanted pepperoni pizza! Blake said they didn't have any but that
didn't mollify Delphine any, so I agreed to take her up to the counter and
ask if they had any pepperoni pizza.</p>
<p>Well, I know you've all figured it out by now, but I was tired. Obviously,
Mike's Pizzeria was our second kosher establishment of the day (you could
tell from the kippah on the guy behind the counter, and the black-hat 
enjoying his pizza and newspaper) but I once again didn't put it together
until it was spelled out for me. Pizza &rArr; cheese &rArr; milk &rArr; no
meat &rArr; no pepperoni.  Sorry, kid. But the macaroni and cheese was
sublime, and Delphine got her own slice of plain cheese pizza.</p>
<p>After dinner we headed back to the hotel to get the children to bed at a
decent hour, and then we watched TV on my laptop until our bedtime. (The
girls slept on the pullout couch in the living room, and we had a delightfully
huge and  comfortable king-sized bed.)</p>
