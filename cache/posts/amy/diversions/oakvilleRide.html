<p>A couple of years ago, as you might remember, Blake biked from
Toronto to Balm Beach on Georgian Bay, a 135K ride preceded by
several long training rides. He got all fit that summer, and
seemed to have fun (mostly), so I proposed that we do something
similar this summer: plan a nice long ride, do some longish
training rides, spend some time together and get fit.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Blake, Kat and I did one 44K training ride, and then 
we biked to Oakville. (It's way too hard to schedule rides for
three people and a babysitter.) We picked Oakville because it 
is the right distance&mdash;a
100 K round trip&mdash;and because it's nice. Kat's been there
a few times so she knows the lay of the land.</p>
<p>The day started early&mdash;our babysitter arrived, Tim's in hand,
at 7:50 am, and Blake and I got on our bikes and headed down Mount
Pleasant to meet Yonge Street somewhere south of St. Clair. We
tried to leave Yonge a couple of times, but with Bay Street on 
one side and the Pride parade on the other, we didn't have a lot
of options. It was fun blowing through downtown first thing on a
Sunday, and before we knew it we were at our rendezvous point at 
King. Kat joined us and we made for the waterfront.</p>
<p>Our route took us west on Queen's Quay to the Waterfront Trail, past 
harbours and beaches and coves and rocky bits and all kinds of
watery goodness. We stopped at the beautiful Humber Pedestrian 
Bridge for a photo op and some energy bars, then blew past the
Butterfly Garden in Mimico, making a note to stop there on the
way home.</p>
<p>Soon after that the rain started. It wasn't a drizzle, making us
moist and warm. It wasn't a driving rain, lashing into our faces.
It was merely large raindrops, plenty of them, falling straight down.
Not ill-mannered rain, but very insistent, very wet, very rainy
rain. We were soon soaked.</p>
<p>We carried on, through Etobicoke and into Mississauga. We were still
on the Waterfront Trail, which at that point alternated between 
on-road routes (with some great real estate and gardens to ogle, especially
on the water side) and a wide paved trail travelling beside the water
through parks and woods. For a while we leapfrogged with a
pair of athletic dads (I could tell they were athletic because
they were wearing technical biking gear) pulling their kids
in trailers, but they left us near the edge of Mississauga, saying,
"It's all sidewalks from here on".</p>
<p>They were right about that. The Mississauga/Oakville border bit
of the Waterfront Trail is mainly oversized sidewalks beside busy
streets, with a rather surreal detour through an industrial area
("Trucks crossing") and directly beside a complicated, strangely 
beautiful Petro-Canada plant.</p>
<p>Eventually the actual trail&mdash;well, the overgrown 
sidewalks&mdash;ran out and we had to bike through
the curvy, monotonous streets of suburbia.  The houses got
farther apart, the streets lacked sidewalks, the... oh, don't
make me go all Kunstler on you. Finally Mississauga ended and
Oakville began, to much rejoicing by Kat. (I don't know that
anyone has ever been that happy to get to Oakville. I was
just wet. Did I mention it was still raining?)</p>
<p>Oakville's contribution to the Waterfront Trail does not appear
to go anywhere near the waterfront. It consists of narrow
sidewalks, signposted alternately with forbidding notices
informing you that Oakville frowns on bike riding on sidewalks,
and friendly green signs with bike icons on them, running
beside giant houses on vast acreages.  You can't ogle the 
houses, though, because they're walled in. I did get a 
look at a couple
of greenhouses. Occasionally the sidewalk ends, to be replaced
by a grit path, intersected by driveways used by people who
don't look out for you because no-one has ever been mad enough to bike
this way before. As we biked I nursed my hatred for rich people.</p>
<p>If you persevere on this path beyond all sense and reason, eventually
you will get to "downtown" Oakville, which is a lot like Bayview
and Davisville.  That's a hell of a long way to travel for someplace 
just like home, but there's modern life for you. </p>
<p>We locked up our bikes and searched for a restaurant sufficiently 
casual that the entrance of three grubby, soaked cyclists
wouldn't put everyone off their lunch. We ended up at a
sandwich cafe where we ate good sandwiches,
mediocre soup, and disappointing desserts, while debating
our next move. </p>
<p>We were wet but not 
disheartened, but Blake and I were bored with biking through
suburbia and Oakville's shitty "bike path". Kat, whose thirst
for challenge apparently knows no bounds, wanted to bike 
the whole damn way back. Blake was having no fun, and wanted
to take the GO train all the way back. I was tempted to agree
with Blake but I could also sympathise with Kat's desire for a
more epic ride, to push ourselves a little more. I suggested
we use the GO train to skip the boring suburbs and land us back
in civili&ndash;, I mean, Toronto to bike home along the bits of the Waterfront
Trail that are actually within sight of water.</p>
<p>We raced to the Oakville GO station and made the 2:30 train,
wrestling our bikes onto inconveniently non-bike-accomodating
cars for the twenty-five minute ride to Mimico, where we
rejoined the trail along the water. It had stopped raining
while we were on the train, but obligingly started again
once we were back on our bikes. The ride back into town was
uneventful&mdash;we did slow down through the butterfly
garden but lacked the inclination to linger. By the time we got
to Bay Street our bums were all sore and we were exhausted.
Blake and I
took the TTC back up to Davisville and then enjoyed the short
ride home, although not as much as we enjoyed long, hot showers
and some quality couch time.</p>
<p>All in all it came to 67.5 K for Blake and I (7 K less for Kat 
because she didn't have to ride downtown), which is pretty
good but not quite epic. I'd like to try another couple
of long rides this summer, if we can find indulgent babysitters,
although I think I would rather take transit out to somewhere
interesting and bike from there, than have to bike through
the suburbs again.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, I looked at the maps after we got home and 
Port Credit is really where the Waterfront Trail stops being 
nice&mdash;we were being conservative when we came all the
way back to Mimico.)</p>
