<p>Last year Blake and I got sucked into the CBC's version of
<em>How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria</em>, mainly on account
of Barrowman Barrowman Barrowman, but also because I love
singing contests. After it was over, I decided it would be cool to
watch the movie of <em>The Sound of Music</em> with the girls. As it
turned out, it was both too long and too scary. Delphine was
scared by the stern Captain, and also by the Nazis.  Nevertheless,
I decided to take Delphine with me to see the Toronto stage
production. She's never seen a musical (or a play, for that
matter) and it seemed like the right time. Plus I wanted to go.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Dephine didn't want to go, but Blake and I convinced
her that the show would be less intense on stage, and that either way it
would be a fun day out with me. (Cordelia stayed home with 
Blake.)</p>
<p>So this Wednesday I picked Delphine up at school at lunchtime,
and we took the subway downtown together to see the matinee. We stopped for 
barbeque pork buns and egg tarts at Urban Bakery and then
went to the theatre where we found our seats (and a deluxe 
booster for Delphine), surrounded by middle schoolers on field
trips. (They behaved beautifully, apart from some untoward hooting
during the first kiss.)</p>
<p>The show was wonderfully staged, with gorgeous sets and
evocative lighting. The singing was great, the big numbers were
satisfyingly big&mdash;my favourite was "Do Re Mi": both educational and
breathtakingly energetic. It wasn't too scary for Delphine&mdash;the 
Captain was stern for much less time, and even the Nazis seemed
less threatening. Little Nazis far away on a stage are less intimidating
than big closeup Nazis in your living room.</p>
<p>One genuinely creepy moment for me was when they dressed the
entire Princess of Wales theatre with Nazi flags for the Austrian Music
Festival scene. They hung swastikas above all the boxes, and a giant 
Reichsadler flag billowed down from the ceiling. It was chilling, unexpected
and very effective. (I wonder if they did the same thing in the English
production.)</p>
<p>My only complaint about the show was the weird marble-mouthed mid-Atlantic
accent in which Elicia Mackenzie delivered Maria's dialogue.  I couldn't
place it at the time but in retrospect it reminded me of an incomprehensible
hybrid of Agent Smith from <em>The Matrix</em> and <em>Mythbusters'</em> Jamie 
Hyneman. Between the weird accent and the snappy delivery, I missed
a couple of lines of dialogue. The dude playing The Captain delivered his lines
in much the same way, so I guess it was a directorial decision.</p>
<p>All in all, a successful outing. Delphine asked to go to another show with
me. I said we would go again next year.</p>
