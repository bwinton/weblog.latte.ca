One of the things -- one of the many things -- I love about
this condo is that it's right on a major street, so when
I open the windows the sounds of the city come into my 
living room.  Traffic, sirens, the "beep, beep, beep" of
a truck backing up, people shouting to their friends...
crazy people yelling, the odd car crash.  To most people,
I guess, this doesn't sound so hot, but I like the
feeling of being in the middle of something without
having to actually leave the house.

Today a lone saxophonist plays on the corner outside
Starbucks, adding an urbane, mellow touch to the
sunny afternoon soundscape.
