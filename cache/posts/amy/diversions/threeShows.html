Three TV shows worth watching: 
<a href="http://www.nbc.com/Chuck/">Chuck</a>, which looks like
absolute cheesy crap but it has great characters, and it's funny,
and hey, it has 
<a href="http://www.nbc.com/Chuck/about/bios/baldwin.shtml">Jayne</a>!
<a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">Battlestar Galactica</a>,
which pretty much everyone knows about now.  Fantastic characters 
(that's mainly what I look for in a TV show) and thought-provoking
plot lines.  And last but not least, my current favourite,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchwood">Torchwood</a>,
the show that makes me wish Leontine still worked for the BBC so
she could design a cool box for the DVD and then send it to me. 
With the DVDs in it.
Russell T. Davies is a brilliant writer who has created an ensemble
of witty, subtle and interesting (oh, and gorgeous) characters and 
put them in a universe
which keeps throwing horrible things at them.  If you miss 
<em>Buffy</em>, this is the show for you.

Edited to add: (I mentioned this to Blake yesterday and he said I
should post it.  I guess any vestigial signs of intelligence should
be encouraged.)  <em>Torchwood</em> is the show <em>Angel</em> would 
have been if it
had been better written and David Boreanaz was a better actor: it's
dark, sexy, adult, scary, with lots of great one-liners and sex.  Plenty
of sex.

Jeez.  Apparently I am not the first person to make that connection;

T. Davies was</a>.  Well, he did borrow Spike, didn't he.
