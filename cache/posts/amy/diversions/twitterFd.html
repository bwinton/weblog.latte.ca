<p>Dave Pell thinks <a href="http://davenetics.com/2009/10/top-25-reasons-were-fucked/">we're fucked</a>. Or rather, Dave Pell thinks most of the stuff people
post to Twitter is a boring waste of time. Why he chose to express
that as "we're fucked" I'm not sure. We're fucked because the
earth is heating up and no-one has the balls to do anything about it,
but that doesn't have much to do with Twitter.</p>
<p>Dave Pell doesn't like people posting about the following
on Twitter: where they are; current events and their opinions
on them; the party they are at; their children; flight delays; their
small fitness triumphs; jokes or puns they made up or ideas they
had; what they're listening to; what they're thinking about; where they
are; the state of their inbox; the weather.</p>
<p>You know what all those things are? They're small talk. Small talk is
a social lubricant. Small talk is how you get to know someone better so you
can decide if you want to share Big Talk with them.  Small talk is
how you connect with other human beings, it's how you reach out and
find out what you share. It's how you gain an understanding of 
how everyone else experiences the world.</p>
<p>Small talk is not profound.
No-one can be profound all the time, but if the only time we're allowed
to connect with other people is when we have the energy and
insight to be profound, this is going to be one hell of a lonely
life. </p>
<p>I love people. I love being with people and sharing and
chatting about kids and weather and books and news. Sometimes the
conversations I have with people are superficial and trivial, sometimes
they are intense and intellectual. Sometimes the conversations I
have with people are in the flesh, and sometimes they are on the Internet.
Either way, I make a connection, and I feel happier and more human.
Does that mean I'm fucked? I really don't think so.</p>
