Now that both England and Brazil are out of the World Cup
finals I'm having a hard time getting excited about the
last few games.  At least Italy are in; they are always
a useful second backup after Brazil, but while I am glad
to see them play, I don't really care all that much whether
they win or lose.

Anyway, it's hard watching football around here.  Watching a 
football match properly calls for a degree of attention
that is impossible while you are making sure that Child 2
isn't choking on some abandoned crayon, and at the same
time reading Pooh (with all the right voices) to Child 1.
So mostly it's been on as background noise for the last 
month, a screen saver for the television.  It's the most
TV Delphine has ever watched, I think.  We talk
about where the players come from, and what their names
are.  (Delphine now knows that Germany is a country.)

I will be sorry when it's all over; I have tried being
interested in league football, but I just don't care,
and even the Euro Cup (or whatever it's called) isn't
all that interesting.  You have to have the little 
African countries to root for, and the wonderful 
South Americans.  So I'll put my fan hat away until 
2010, when Delphine will be seven and Cordelia
will be three and a half -- older than Delphine is
now.  (Last World Cup we had no children at all!)  And
maybe next time England will win...
