Let's get that bit of glurge off the top of the page, shall we?  I
called my brother and he is JUST FINE, he is not a child or an emotional
cripple, he does not need me to take care of him, he is perfectly
capable of living in a city without me there without falling into
the pit of despair.
</p><p>
Seriously, I always think he's much more miserable than he really is.
He sends me these long gloomy Eeyoreish emails about how awful 
everything is and I get all upset.   Then I talk to him on the 
phone and he says the same things, but he says them with a smile
in his voice and I can imagine the spark in his pretty blue eyes
and I know he's okay.
</p><p>
I, on the other hand, am running out of money, am freaking out
about it, am so clumsy and nervous and excitable that I seriously 
took a pregnancy test today (negative).  I need a break, or something,
and Delphine <em>won't stop crying</em>.  Feh.  Soon Blake will be
home and we can go to Starbucks and cook a pizza or something 
and watch bad television, and then it will be the weekend, hoorah.
