I tried to cheap out on hand lotion (as I have already established, I
do not like to spend money on personal care items) and bought a huge
bottle of Jergen's moisturizer for five bucks, but it wasn't doing the
job.
My hands get desperately dry, they crack and bleed and the skin gets
thick and coarse, and this winter is worse than ever because I'm 
washing my hands all the time, and it's so damn cold.  The cheap 
lotion is about as effective as a ... something ineffective,
anyway, so I girded my loins to spend twelve bucks on a bottle of
sterner stuff.

The first thing I picked up was a bottle of Eucerin
because their advertising had convinced me they were hardcore enough
to take on my hands.  I was about to head to the cash when I noticed
the bottle of Norwegian Formula, smaller, for the same price.  
I'd heard good things about from actual people (rather than ads), so 
I made a last-minute decision to get it instead.

When I got the bottle home I noticed the child-proof cap, surely a
good sign.  It must be powerful stuff if you have to protect your
children from it.    I read the label on the back: "Apply to  affected
area not more than 3-4 times daily."  Well!  Another good sign!
And it has Lidocaine;
I'm thinking this was twelve dollars well spent.  I have yet to see
whether it cures my poor miserable hands, but my hopes are high.
