It's Thursday at 6:14 pm.  Blake should be home soon, because he went into
the office early.  In the meantime, I'm sitting at the computer reading
the forum and nursing Delphine, who is in a crusty mood today.

She got the cold that I had, or maybe she got some other, unrelated cold,
but either way she's coughing and has a snotty nose, and for all I know
has a sinus headache like I did yesterday.  She's generally behaving 
sensitive; little things are setting her off in a way that they
don't normally.  Poor thing.
</p><p>
She's crawling, though.  Properly crawling, on hands and knees, not 
creeping on her belly.  Sometimes she still creeps, when she's on hardwood
and wants to go fast, and she's gotten really good at it; she looks like
a crocodile when she's going at top speed, little limbs splayed out
to right and left, her whole torso twisting from side to side.

I'm off to Florida to visit my in-laws next Thursday.  I'm only there for
five days, until the following Tuesday.  I decided I'd only go for a few
days because I don't really like Florida, am not really interested in 
shopping or sitting in the sun.  What I didn't consider when I made the
decision is that with Florida comes three full-time babysitters (my
mother-, father-, and sister-in-law), meaning
it will be as much of a vacation from mum-duty as any mother is ever
likely to have without actually having to be apart from her kids.  And 
I could really use the break.  I don't think five days will be enough, 
but it's too late to change now; next year I'll go for longer, and count
my blessings.
