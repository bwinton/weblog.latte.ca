Not much to say, I just feel like being heard and I've been away from
the Suspects for so long it would be weird to just step back in and start
talking about myself.  Isn't that what blogs are for?

It's a partly cloudy day, and I feel my mood rise and fall precisely
with the appearance and disappearance of the sun.  Delphine is in the
middle of a long nap, and I should be doing housework but I'm catching
up on Mimi Smartypants and Dooce instead.  Morgan's coming over tomorrow
afternoon to babysit while I houseclean, so that has given me license
to slack off and play with the baby instead of trying to clean.  Which
is good because Delphine has a cold and she's needy and cranky and
really doesn't want to have to hang desperately onto my pants leg as
I try and wash dishes.

I'm coming down with a cold, too, probably the same one.  It's only
mild as yet, just a scratchy throat.  Hopefully I'll lick it quickly
and pass the antibodies onto Del so we aren't sick for too long.
