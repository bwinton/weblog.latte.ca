It's far too early on Saturday morning.  Delphine woke up around
5:30 all fidgety and cry-y.  I nursed her back to sleep but then I had
to get up to pee, and by the time I was done my brain had woken up too
much to attempt going back to sleep.
</p><p>
All for the best, really, as I have a bunch of things to do this
morning.  Sascha and <a href="http://leontinemay.blogspot.com/">Leontine</a>
are coming up this morning on the fast ferry from Rochester, and before
they get here I'd like to have the guest bedroom all set up, so they feel
welcome.  I hate to go to someone's place and have them all rushing around
to make up a bed for me, it makes me feel like I'm imposing.
</p><p>
We also need to clean up the guest bathroom.  Yesterday the bathtub faucet
started leaking, only it was more a stream than a drip, so Blake got all
manly and pulled it all apart and fixed it with parts scavenged from a
faucet cartridge found in the security desk downstairs.  By the time
he'd got it fixed it was late and time for dinner, so he didn't finish
putting the faucet back together yet;  it's all spread around the bathroom.

Finally, I have to put together a care package for Delphine because she's
going away!  Okay, only from nine this morning until around three
this afternoon, to go visit some friends of my in-laws' while Blake and
I and Sascha and Leontine go for dim sum and <em>Spider-man 2</em>.
But that's almost all day!  I have to pack diapers, and wipes, and a
spare outfit, and a sweater, and sun block and a hat, and some food
and a sippy cup, and maybe twenty bucks in case she needs to get a cab
home.
</p><p>
I also worry that when Sascha and Leontine see that Delphine isn't with
us they'll get right back on the ferry and go home.
