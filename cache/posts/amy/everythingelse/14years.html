<p>On this day in 1995, Blake and I started going out.
I was nineteen, in third year (or second? It's a blur.)
and Blake was just about to turn 22.
We had been friends for about a month.  We started
hanging out after seeing <em>Pulp Fiction</em> with a group
of friends at a Waterloo repertory theatre.  The 
chemistry was great and we spent all our time together.
Finally on March 2nd we decided to start going out,
and we've been together ever since!</p>
<p>Okay, not much to this post but I wanted to mark the
day.  Fourteen years is a long time!</p>
