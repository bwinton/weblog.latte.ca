<p>This weekend Blake and the girls and I went to Greg Wilson's 
housewarming party.  Wow.  I have never in my life
been surrounded
by so many accomplished, interesting people.  Scientists, professors,
a guy who was writing a book, millions of PhDs.  The woman 
who owns Bakka books
was there, for Pete's sake.  Everyone was very clever and
cool and I, predictably enough, felt pretty boring and lame.
I think I aquitted myself fairly well, though, mainly by not saying 
very much.</p>
<p>It was a weird situation.  In a way I felt totally out of my
depth, completely outclassed, but in another way I felt like
I could fit in pretty well.  For example, I read <em>New
Scientist</em> magazine.  I have never knowingly met anyone
else who reads <em>New Scientist</em>.  (Apparently my friend
Dmitri reads it too but it's never come up when I've talked to
him.)  At yesterday's party, three of the people in one
particular conversation all read it, not counting me.
But does that mean that I'm in their league or does it just
make me a wannabe?</p>
<p>I dunno.  On the one hand I think I'm pretty smart.  On the
other hand, I have nothing to show for it.  Maybe I'm like one of
those people on <em>American Idol</em> who swear they're great
singers because their friends all tell them so, and then
they open their mouths and it sounds like someone's violating
a corgi.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm not particularly good with other people's parties
at the best of times so I think I did pretty well yesterday.
I talked to several different people about different things,
and I didn't make too much of an ass of myself.  I even made
people laugh a couple of times.  The 
children behaved themselves and were gorgeous.  And I have
serious appliance envy for Sadie's induction cooktop.  Gas
is pretty and all but that shizznit is <em>fast</em>.</p>
