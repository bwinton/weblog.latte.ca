If I learned anything from 
<a href="http://www.celluloideyes.com/holidailies/">Holidailies</a> it
was that it takes a village to write an entry, or at least a household.
Each entry I wrote was a commitment of at least forty-five minutes,
and I'd need Blake to look after Delphine while I wrote it.  Most of
the entries I wrote after dinner, in the evening, when we would normally
be going to bed, and I think it shows.

Long story short, since apparently I don't even have time to write
a little weblog entry, I'm shutting down my other journal for the 
forseeable future (probably until Delphine and Little Number Two
are in grade school) and writing here instead.  (Later when I have
time I will put a note to that effect on the journal page.)  
I think it will be easier to write more often
with a weblog.  And hell, some of my 
<a href="http://www.3harpiesltd.com/lfeb/logs/">favourite</a>
<a href="http://leontinemay.blogspot.com/">journals</a> are
