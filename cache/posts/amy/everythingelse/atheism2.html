<p>So (obviously?) I've been thinking a lot about my beliefs
(or lack thereof) lately.  I came across this good quote
today from Dale McGowan, the guy who wrote the book about
raising children without religion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though I’m sure they exist, I have never yet met an 
atheist delusional enough to say he or she knows God does 
not exist. Atheism simply means “I don’t think God exists.” 
It is a statement of belief, based on the evidence as we 
see it, not one of certainty. But agnostic is too often 
misunderstood as a 50-50, “dunno, don’t care” position. 
That not really an agnostic, it’s an 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheist">apatheist</a>. I said 
that I am a teapot agnostic, then explained 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot">what that is</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually <a href="http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/blog/?p=1578">the whole post</a> 
is really good.  Anyway, I think I might lean towards apathetic
agnosticism, except that I find this stuff quite interesting to
think about.  And I quite enjoy not believing in stuff, which
isn't very apathetic of me.</p>
