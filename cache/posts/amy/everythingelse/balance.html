<p>Something's not quite right in my life; I'm out of balance.
Fortunately &mdash; and I know this is rare &mdash; I know what's wrong
and I have a pretty good idea how to fix it.</p>
<p>A few months ago I got this laptop. It's a Toshiba Satellite
with a Celeron (celery!) processor and 192 MB of RAM. It's
running Windows XP and it's really, really slow. (I should
probably switch to Ubuntu.)  Nevertheless,
it's a laptop, and that means I can fart around on the Internet
while we watch TV, after the girls are in
bed. That's good because it adds an extra couple of hours
to my Internet day, giving me time to blog and Twitter. It's
bad because somehow the combination of TV and Internet makes
it very, very hard for me to get off my butt and go to bed
at a reasonable hour, leaving me cranky and exhausted the 
next day.  The other bad is that I don't write
particularly well when I'm watching TV, and I don't watch
TV particularly well when I'm writing.  The TV I watch 
tends to reward attentive viewing, and half-watching it is
worse than either watching it or not watching it at all.</p>
<p>Simple problem, simple fix: I'm going to stop using the
laptop in the evenings, and instead watch TV properly, or 
read if it's one of Blake's shows.  I'll go to bed at a 
decent hour, which will give me the energy to write in the 
afternoons. Currently my afternoons are spent either
napping (on the really bad days) or reading, with a little
light housekeeping if I absolutely have to. I'm not sure
whether writing in the afternoon will deal too much of a
blow to my reading time; I hope I will be able to get to
bed by ten and read until eleven, and maybe read in the
mornings sometimes too.</p>
<p>All this is temporary, of course: once Cordelia is in 
school everything will change again and I'll have to find
a new balance.</p>
