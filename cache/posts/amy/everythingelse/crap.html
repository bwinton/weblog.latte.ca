If I had one of those blogs with a "mood" field, I would write
"bummed" and put a little sad face.  I just poked around the
Queens and OISE (Ontario Institute for Studies in Education) 
websites and found out that because I got such crappy marks in
university I don't qualify to get into their teacher education
programs.  I have no idea what I should do about this -- do I
have to get another degree?  Go to someone's office and beg?
</p><p>
It's extra ironic because I have a three year degree, so according
to Queens that means I need a B average, but if I had a four year
degree they wouldn't even care what my marks are.  
However, the reason my marks are
so bad is that I was taking Honours (four-year) courses, which are
harder than the three-year program courses.  If I had been taking
three-year General courses I would have been getting As and Bs
instead of Cs and Ds.  And Fs.
</p><p>
Also ironic because
I am smart and I would make a good teacher (I think), and university
was a million years ago &mdash; since then I have worked, travelled,
become a parent &mdash; and how well I did or didn't do back then
is so irrelevant to how well I would do as a teacher now, ten 
years later, that I am frankly shocked and taken aback that it would
even come up.  But they don't have any options for mature students;
I am bound now by bad decisions I made when I was eighteen.  Still.
Again.

Stupid.  I guess I will have to go meet with a registrar and see
if they have any bright ideas.
