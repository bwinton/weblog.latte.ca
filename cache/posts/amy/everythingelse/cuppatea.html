No particular reason for that title, I just always wanted to use
it, and it is generally true.  In fact, I could pretty much use
it as the title of my entire journal.

First some shout outs (shouts out?) to my crippled friends.
On the other side of the pond is my friend Frances, who I
knew when I was in the equivalent of grade seven and eight,
and who I have by some miracle managed to keep in touch with
ever since, off and on.  We barely know each other, really,
but we persist in keeping in touch because we're stubborn
like that.  And as it turns out she likes Minette Walters
too, so she must be at least as cool as she was back in 
1907 or whenever.
</p><p>
Anyway, she is laid up with a broken leg which she suffered
in a bar fight at the hands of two unnamed female assailants while nobly
protecting a friend.  Fortunately Frances is a kickboxer
so if she has a broken leg I shudder to think what shape
the others were in.

A little closer to home, my friend Kathryn (Delphine's
"beatifuw Kafryn") also broke her ankle over Christmas.
Sadly she doesn't have a good story like Frances, but she
does have an assortment of plates and pins in her leg which
necessitate her carrying a card at all times stating that
she is not a terrorist.  I think that's pretty cool.

Kathryn is one of those people who seems to be blessed with
longer days than the rest of us, because she crams in so
much.  Besides being a teacher she also is in at least two
bands (she plays flute and piccolo) and my choir.  She plays
volleyball and just the other day I suggested we go skating
together sometime (after she's better, of course) and she
casually mentioned that yeah, she's a certified CanSkate
instructor.  All this and she's pretty too.  She
has a <a href="http://inquisiturient.blogspot.com/">new
blog</a> so all y'all can read about her interesting 
and busy life.  (No pressure, Kathryn.)

Cordelia just woke up so that will have to be all for now.
I'm off for a cuppa tea.
