<p>Blake and I went for a bike ride today while the girls were out swimming
with Baba and Zaida. I didn't really want to go, but Blake does so love
to ride his bike, and I don't mind biking. So off we went, and went up
some steepish hills and down a slightly scary one, found some nice nature
to bring Delphine to, and lost contact with my butt. And that was, as
they say, all well and good, but the interesting thing happened later.</p>
<p>I felt great.</p>
<p>My back didn't hurt, my foot didn't hurt (I've had plantar fasciitis for,
like, months), and I had enough energy to run up and down the sidewalk
flying a kite with Cordelia. I didn't realize how bad I'd been feeling lately
until I stopped feeling bad, and clearly part of the problem is the
utter lack of aerobic exercise I've been doing lately. I'm not exactly
sure what I'm going to do about that...</p>

<p>Cordelia and I fought today. Not the screamy angry kind of fighting,
but silly punching kicking fighting. She was hitting me as hard as
she could, and of course I was just play hitting. It's never come 
up before, so I have no idea of the etiquette of playfighting. I
suppose it's not done to playfight at all any more, but she's just
so cute when she snarls at me with her perfectly straight tiny
teeth, and thumps me with her tiny ineffectual fists. It's like
being menaced by a chinchilla.</p>

<p>We watched Prince of Egypt today, admittedly a week late for Passover.
I had forgotten how great that movie is. We bought it, so we can watch
it as often as we like. Every Passover! We don't do anything else
for Passover, apart from eat a lot at Baba's house, so why not 
create our own traditions?</p>
