<p>I'd like you to meet Max. Max is my new Macbook. New to me&mdash;he's
actually refurbished. He's the first computer I've had to myself since I was in high school. Max has a 2.13 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, and
2 GB of RAM. He's running Snow Leopard, and he's <em>fast</em>. Max doesn't
make me wait for anything. </p>
<p>I called him Max because all our computers have people names, and
because he's all white, like Max in <em>Where The Wild Things Are</em>.</p>
<p>Max is my work computer. I couldn't get anything done with the old
laptop I was using because it was basically too slow to load any web
pages, so I asked Blake to lend me $1000 of "our" money. I said
I would pay it back. This agreement makes me uncomfortable and
slightly unhappy, but I suppose that's a conversation to have with
Blake. And at least I got Max out of it.</p>
