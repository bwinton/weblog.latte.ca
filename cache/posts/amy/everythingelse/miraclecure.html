Due to an ill-advised combination of drinks last night (cherry
beer plus sweet wine plus cider) I woke up with a killer
headache and no small amount of nausea.  It was miserable;
you would think by thirty I would know how to drink sensibly.
I didn't even get drunk!  It was just all the alcopop.

But the best part is that my back, which has been troubling
me for weeks, feels fantastic today;  no aching or tightness
or alarming stabbing pains. I'm not sure if it's coincidence
or the muscle relaxant properties of alcohol, or what, but 
I am very pleased.  (Now that my headache and nausea is gone.)
