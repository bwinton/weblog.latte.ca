I have too much stuff in too little space, and I don't have
the resources to reduce the stuff or increase the space.
My hair looks like hell and is constantly, annoyingly in my eyes.
I have a premobile baby whose every physical need is my
responsibility, and a stubborn toddler whose emotional
upheavals are severely trying my already limited patience and
empathy.  I have so many things to do and I haven't any idea
how or when to start.
</p><p>
My skin is so dry that every time I move my bra feels like
sandpaper on my raw back, and my hands make me cry to look
at them.  My feet are revoltingly calloused and I haven't
painted my nails since before Christmas.  All my clothes 
are old and ill-fitting, and I couldn't make myself look
respectable even if I had the time and space to do so.
</p><p>
But instead of dealing with any of these problems, or just
waiting for them to pass, I bake.  Please, come over and
eat my cookies and carrot cake and banana bread.  And while
you're here you can help me get rid of some crap.  Or maybe
just hold the baby while I fix my toenails.
