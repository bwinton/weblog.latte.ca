Here I am in the most curious of situations; I have a
generally clean house and two sleeping girls.  I have
time on my hands.  I should spend it reading, because
I have books which a due back on Friday and which I
won't be able to renew because other people want them,
but on the other hand I should post here, because
clearly I have been neglecting this space.
</p><p>
About that...  a long, long time ago, I posted a big
whine about how I never do the things I want to do 
because I spend too much time watching television.  
Well, I am finally doing something about that.  Last
night I sat down and wrote down all the shows I 
<em>want</em> to watch (as distinguished from the shows
I watch because I am parked in front of the tv when
they are on) and what time they are on, and I don't
intend to switch on the television except at those
times.  (Unless I am checking the weather on channel
24.)
</p><p>
That should free up lots of time for reading, which
is good because I have forty books on hold at the
library.  And for posting here, which is good because
I miss it, and for reading my favourite discussion
board, which is really good because I really miss it.
</p><p>
Television isn't the only thing I am writing down;
I also started making four-week meal plans -- I 
come up with list of dinners, make a grand shopping
list and get Grocery Gateway to bring me everything
I will need.  Perishables I buy a week in advance.
It's awesome knowing what I am going to make for
dinner every day, and it's nice not to have to do
a big grocery shop every weekend.  Also it lets
me balance and control the amount of, say, beef
versus vegetarian meals we eat.
</p><p>
I'm also doing <a href="http://www.fitday.com">Fitday</a>
again, just to see whether I'm eating the right
amounts of things.  
</p><p>
Generally I seem to be seeking control over as
many aspects of my life as possible.  I don't
know why, quite, but I expect it has something
to do with the uncontrollability of babies and 
small children.  And more directly, I was getting
sick of my groundless feelings of helplessness
regarding, on the one hand, my failure to read
enough and on the other my failure to eat properly
and take care of myself.  Sitting around moaning
about your problems doesn't make them go away,
writing stuff down and getting on with it does.
At least if you're me.
</p><p>
Incidentally, I feel (a little)
bad writing this much stuff
about myself; I feel like everyone comes here to
read about my children, not me.  Which is pretty
amusing considering I had an online journal long
before I had any children.
</p><p>
But more about me... we just got back from a
week in Saskatchewan visiting my parents.  It
was a nice time; we flew our kite, Delphine and
I went out in a boat, we ate lots of birthday
cake (Delphine turned three and my Dad turned
eighty-five while we were there), met new people.
My parents had a nice time with Delphine; my
mother was particularly amused by her constant
"Why"s.  We had fun coming up with good answers.
</p><p>
Now we're back home and everything is getting
back to normal.   These days, normal means
Delphine goes to daycare two or three days a
week, for the whole day.  She still enjoys it,
although she's been crying when we drop her off
since we got home from Sask.  I expect that will
pass soon.  The days she is in daycare, Cordelia
and I go for a long walk.  I do housework, I
amuse Cordelia, I cook and bake, I read.  
</p><p>
When Delphine
is home we generally don't stray far from home --
we might go to the park or to the convenience
store.  I do more housework but less baking, and
we read books, or do puzzles or play with 
playdough.  I don't get to read when Delphine 
is home because she bothers me to read to her
or play with her, except on the odd occasion
when both girls sleep at the same time.  Delphine
doesn't usually take a nap at home, although
I suspect she probably should.  (She usually
sleeps at daycare, they say.)
</p><p>
The girls have dinner at five and bedtime starts
at five-thirty.  If I am lucky everyone is in
bed by six-thirty, although it's more usually
around seven, and then Blake and I cook dinner
together.  We eat, we watch TV, we sleep, we
do it all again the next day.
</p><p>
On the weekends I get up when the girls do (six), 
and I let Blake sleep until seven-thirty or
eight.  Delphine and I make pancakes and eggs
one morning; the other morning we just have
cereal, and then after Blake wakes up we go
to the patisserie to get croissants and stuff
and the deli to get meat and cheese for 
brunch.  We go up to Eglinton to do errands 
(Shopper's, Dominion, bulk food, Future Shop),
grab a coffee on the way home.  That's our
weekend.  We're very domestic.
</p><p>
It's starting to feel a little crowded in our
condo -- Delphine is now sleeping in her bed
in our room, so that Cordelia can get used
to sleeping on her own before we move the two
of them together.  There really isn't room in
our bedroom for Delphine's bed, so I'm constantly
shimmying sideways to get past things.  
The toys are starting to take over the living
room, particularly the big things which can't
be hidden in boxes.  We have wagons and bikes
and strollers tucked away in every nook and
cranny.  And the kitchen is getting too small
-- there are multiple small appliances I am 
waiting on getting until we have a bigger
kitchen, not to mention the frustration of
only having space for one kind of rice.
(Chinese food with basmati is just weird;
ditto sticky rice with curry.)
</p><p>
Nevertheless, we will have to put up with it
until next spring.  The plan, then, is that
I will get a part-time job which will bring 
in some extra cash, and we can then make an
informed decision about how much we can 
afford to pay for a house.  I have
a horrible fear that in the meantime our
neighbourhood will become massively trendy
and we won't be able to afford to stay here,
but I am willing to put up with a pretty crappy
house in order to stay close by, so I guess
it will work out in the end.
</p><p>
That's enough blather.  Cordelia is awake and
any moment now she will get tired of chewing on
my toes and go for the computer cables instead.
