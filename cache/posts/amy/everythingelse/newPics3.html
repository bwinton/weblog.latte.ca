Damn, I didn't realize I hadn't posted pictures since April!  I guess
it serves me right that it took over three hours to 
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/">get them posted</a>
this evening.

My only excuse for this and all my other website slacking (and
general life slacking) lately is that I have had both Delphine and
Cordelia home full-time since mid-May.  This Friday Delphine 
starts kindergarten in the afternoons, and next Tuesday Cordelia
starts morning nursery school two days a week, so perhaps I will
have more time to do things.  That's if I don't wear myself out
schlepping them around.  We'll see!
