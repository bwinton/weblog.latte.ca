<p>Tomorrow's the start of the new year. No, not Rosh Hashanah (that's 
Wednesday), although Shana Tova to those of you who are into that kind
of thing. No, tomorrow is the first day of school. </p>
<p>For Cordelia that means Senior Kindergarten with a new teacher and
a whole new batch of friends. Kindergarten in Ontario is arranged
as a two-year deal, and class groupings generally stay the same&mdash;which
is to say all the JKs stay together when they move up to SK. However,
Cordelia is so advanced (or more likely so used to hanging out with
older kids) that all her friends last year were in SK.
So they're all happily off to Grade One and she doesn't
have any friends in her class yet. However, I'm sure she'll work
something out.</p>
<p>When I asked her at dinner, she said she was most excited about
meeting her new teacher. When I asked her what she was most scared about
she said, "There's nothing scary about school!"</p>
<p>Cordelia's other new big thing is that she's starting daycare. I'm
thrilled that she's in daycare, not just because it means I can
have six uninterrupted hours to myself five days a week (although
I am nearly light-headed at the thought), but because I love the 
activities, I love the structure, and I love the fact that she'll get
a healthy lunch and snacks. Frankly if she were home with me she'd
be playing video games while I fold laundry or nap on the couch&mdash;at
daycare she'll be doing music and crafts and all kinds of wonderful
things.  Cordelia's also excited about daycare. They have 
"pretty good centres", she says.</p>
<p>For Delphine, the start of school means Grade Two in a new classroom
in the basement, as part of a Grade Two/Three combined class. Her
teacher is someone I've met briefly and really liked, and she is
in the same class as her best friend. She's more than ready to
go back to school&mdash;she and Cordelia have been needling each
other for the last week.</p>
<p>I can't remember what Delphine was most excited about, but she's scared
there will be spiders in the classroom because they were using it
as a storeroom before. I said they'd probably clean it before the
first day of school.</p>
<p>For me this is also a time of great change. I'm starting work in earnest
now that I have those six uninterrupted hours five days a week.
I'm working on a publishing project at the moment, then after that
I have another editing gig lined up (I was just offered it 
the day before yesterday&mdash;whoo!)</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to working, but at dinner I said the thing I 
was scared about was that I wouldn't have time to work and do all 
the other things I do: volunteer with the school, do housework
and household maintenance, exercise (I want to start training for
a walking &frac12;-marathon), reading. I said I'm worried I will
let someone down or mess something up or find I don't have time
for something.</p>
<p>But really, I'm not all that worried. Since having children I've
become way more efficient, and six hours is really a lot. Six hours is
a lot for one day; I literally can't imagine six hours to myself for 
five days in a row. Let alone for five days in a row for forty-two
weeks! I'll be swimming in time! I could rebuild Rome!</p>
<p>Blake says he isn't scared about anything.</p>
