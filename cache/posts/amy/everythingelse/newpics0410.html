<p>I was once again lured by the siren song of Flick'r, and posted pictures
from 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/arbrown/sets/72157623953138638/">December</a>,
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/arbrown/sets/72157623953085402/">January
to April</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/arbrown/sets/72157623822391929/">Ursa's
birthday party</a> there.
I thought it would be easier than posting on the local page, but
in the end I got tired of editing and saving all the caption text, picture 
by picture. Next time I'll go back to posting pictures on the local page.</p>
