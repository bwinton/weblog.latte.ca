I'm not really inspired by this posting to the Internet thing lately.
I don't have anything particularly original or interesting to say, and
I don't say what I do have to say in an interesting or amusing fashion.
On the other hand it is nice to keep a kind of digital scrapbook of
interesting (to me) things that happen in my life, and this is as good
a place as any to keep it.  And I know there are a few people who care
about me and who I care about who come here and read every so often.

I interrupt myself to say, this is just another meta-entry, isn't it?  
How dull.  Please excuse me, and here is some real content:

I am in that weird spot in my pregnancy, that weird second trimester
spot where I feel generally healthy and normal, I am not showing much,
and I can't feel the baby moving, so it's like I'm not pregnant at 
all.  I remember being freaked out by this last time, and I am again:
<em>Hello!  What happened to my pregnancy?</em>  I have an ultrasound
on April 25th which will, I hope, show that all is well and normal
and present.  And then soon after that I should start to feel movement,
which is, well, neat and cool and nifty and all that stuff you would
imagine it is.
</p><p>
The ultrasound should also show whether it is a girl or a boy, which is swell
because if it's a boy we need to get different clothes, and also because
once we know which it is we only have to pick one name.
</p><p>
I have actually settled on a name I like for a girl, although I'm not
sure Blake is sold on it.  I will have to let it sit a little longer.
It's a good name for a lot of reasons, but it doesn't go so well with
Brown, which would be her last name.   I don't think many names do, though,
so perhaps that is not a good criterion.  We already had a name for a boy
picked out back when Delphine was still believed to be 
a boy, so we will use that if
this next one turns out to be actually a boy.

I started working a while ago, part-time, and so far it is going well.  I
am doing the same thing I always do, dicking around with computers, 
part webmaster, part sys-admin, and also I'm doing some direct marketing
stuff and general around-the-officery.  It's decent and fun and I'm
learning new software and a new(ish) OS -- I'm on a Mac.  It's kind of
cool, what with being Unix as well.  If I had a computer of my very own
I expect I would be a Mac, but I don't.

Blake is getting a Mac of his 
very own but he said last night I can't use it -- I can't even have an
account -- so I am stuck with the old
Unix box and the PC laptop.  Still, I suppose two computers are better
than one.  I think he is just tired of me being logged on to everything
all the time.  If we had one of those Internet fridges I would be logged
on to it all the time, too.  Why log off, when you are just going to have
to log on again?
