<p>Sydney's Playground is the new natural(ish) kindergarten playground at 
Maurice Cody Elementary school. It's named for one of our kindergarteners, who
was killed in a traffic crash while we were in the process of planning the
playground. (This post isn't about Sydney, but it seemed weird to write 
about the playground without mentioning her.)</p>
<p>This post is about the process of designing and building a natural playground
in a TDSB school. When we embarked on the process of building a natural
playground at Maurice Cody there was very little guidance on how to go about
building a playground, so I am writing this in the hope that it will help
someone else. </p>
<p>The caveat is that your mileage may vary: I am not sure how
consistent the TDSB is in terms of policies and processes, and for all I know
your experience will be completely different. Even if it is, I hope this post
gives you some idea of what's possible and what's likely to happen. But
first...</p>
<h4>A Little About Natural Playgrounds</h4>

<p>A <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=natural+playground">natural
playground</a> is a playground built with natural elements instead of
artificial play structures. They are desirable for various reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Being in a natural environment has been shown to improve concentration
and learning</p></li>
<li><p>Unstructured play elements are better for imaginative play in much the
same way that plain Lego blocks are more demanding than Lego kits with
funny shaped blocks and instructions</p></li>
<li><p>Natural elements like logs and rocks are theoretically less expensive
than manufactured play structures</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>What The TDSB Will Do For You</h4>
<p>Our school is one of the few in the TDSB that's growing, and a couple of years
ago the school board built a second playground for the nine kindergarten
classes. When I say "built" I mean they fenced off an area, built some stairs
and put down some mulch. You may not realize this &mdash; I certainly didn't
&mdash; but the TDSB is not in the playground-building business. Despite having
your 3-, 4- and 5-year-olds in their care for six hours a day, and despite the
massive importance of outside play and gross motor activity for early childhood
development, the TDSB does not build playgrounds. They do landscaping, hence
the fencing and mulch, but they don't do playgrounds.</p>
<p>That's up to you, the parents. You have to decide to build a playground, you
have to guide and help manage the consultation and design process and you have
to raise the money.</p>
<p>So there we were with the outline of a playground, and since I was 
eco-committee chair at the time I suggested we should take the opportunity
to build a natural playground. The idea was greeted with various
degrees of enthusiasm; I think mostly people were just glad someone
was doing something about what the kids had named "the nothing playground".</p>
<p>I'm going through the years &mdash; literally &mdash; of emails on this topic
and I think I had better give you the condensed version. (I sent my very first
email about the natural playground in January 2010, and we finished the
playground in August 2012.)</p>
<p>So here's the compressed, idealized process, with advice.</p>
<h4>1. Get Your Ducks (And Your Dollars) In A Row</h4>
<p>First you need to decide you're going to do it. You'll have to sell your
parents, your administration and your teachers on a natural playground.
(I didn't have any trouble with that up front, although there was some
pushback later when people realized what a natural playground actually meant,
and I had to explain the concepts over and over.)</p>
<p>Next you need to meet with your community &mdash; teachers, parents, staff
&mdash; and talk about what you want from the playground. Both from a
high-level, philosophical angle and also about the specifics of what you want:
A slide?  An outdoor classroom? A sand box? Make sure everyone has been
included and that you all roughly agree on what you want. You have to do this
<em>before</em> you come to the table with the TDSB playground designers.</p>
<p>This was one of the most frustrating parts for me, because I didn't feel
we were in any position to make these decisions: we didn't have either
a landscape architect or a playground designer on our team and we had no
idea what was possible or desirable. But the TDSB wants you to have
met, discussed and agreed before you come to them.</p>
<p>They also want you to have $10 000. Or at least, that's the sum we had
to pony up to prove that we were serious about funding a playground.</p>
<p>Once you have expressed your interest in building a playground, there will be a
meeting with the TDSB groundskeeping staff, the school administration, and
representatives of parents and of teachers. This meeting tripped us up
because the kindergarten staff just sent whichever random teacher was available,
and that teacher hadn't been to any of our previous meetings. So she had no clue
what the concept of a natural playground was and I spent half the meeting
explaining it to her and telling her why we didn't actually want those bouncy
spring toys or another playhouse.  As a result we looked like we hadn't
consulted at all, and we got a stern talking-to from the TDSB designer. She
didn't want to hear from us again until we had consensus on what we wanted.</p>
<p>Don't make the same mistake. Make sure everyone involved understands what
you want.</p>
<h4>2. Get To Know Evergreen</h4>
<p>You know <a href="http://www.evergreen.ca/">Evergreen</a>: they're the people
behind the <a href="http://ebw.evergreen.ca/">Brickworks</a>, where you go for
fresh organic produce (or waffles and French fries, if you're me) at their <a
href="http://ebw.evergreen.ca/farmers-market">Farmer's Market</a>, to <a
href="http://ebw.evergreen.ca/whats-on/bike-works">fix your bike</a>, and where
your kids can look for turtles and make stuff in <em>their</em> natural playground, <a
href="http://ebw.evergreen.ca/whats-on/kids-families/chimney-court">Chimney
Court</a>.</p>
<p>But Evergreen also works very closely <a
href="http://www.evergreen.ca/en/programs/schools/school-boards.sn">with the
TDSB</a> to do <a
href="http://www.evergreen.ca/en/programs/schools/index.sn">schoolyard
greening</a> and playground development. I'm not sure exactly how their
relationship works, but several people we worked with seemed to be employed by
both Evergreen and the TDSB.</p>
<p>Evergreen is also a source of grants, through their <a
href="http://www.evergreen.ca/en/funding/grants/telg.sn">Toyota Evergreen
Learning Grounds School Ground Greening Grants</a>, which is available to pay
for plants and certain playground elements.</p>
<h4>3. Be Flexible</h4>
<p>Once you have furnished the $10 000 and convinced the TDSB you have some
consensus on what you want, they will assign you a landscape architect (no, you
don't get to decide who your landscape architect is) and you'll meet with them.
By now I think a few schools have attempted to build natural playgrounds, so
you shouldn't have to spend too much time explaining what you want and why.
But when you're going through the design process, keep in mind what a "natural
playground" means to your team, and be prepared to be flexible about what yours
will include.</p>
<p><img src="/images/amy/playground/climber.jpg" align="left" alt="Rope climber"
title="This is the climber this summer, before the safety surfacing was
installed."></p>
<p>For example, a playground needs a climbing structure, to help develop balance
and upper-body strength. Some natural climbing structures are, for example,
really large rocks and trees. There is no way we could afford really large
rocks, and trees freak out teachers. So we ended up looking for a manufactured
climbing structure. At one point during our design meetings we had to choose
between an abstract rope climbing structure and a "fort". Neither are natural,
but we chose the rope structure because it satisfied our requirement of being
abstract and, for want of a better phrase, narratively neutral.  It can be a
tent, a rocket, a tree... The fort might be a castle or a house but it's always
a building &mdash; a manufactured simulacrum of a manufactured structure.</p>
<p>Even after we had been working with the concept of a natural playground for a
long time, some members of the team didn't get it. At one point the quote for
the playground came back much higher than we anticipated, and we had to look at
cutting some elements. One of our team members was very put out that we would
only have "two pieces of equipment" in the playground, meaning the slide and
the climber. Those, of course, were the two manufactured elements. She was
overlooking the retaining walls (a.k.a., balance beams, fortresses,
tightropes), the log benches (a.k.a., balance beams, dragons, mountains, blast
shields), the sand box, the rocks (a.k.a., icebergs, dinner tables, space
ships, go-carts), and everything else that didn't come in a big box labelled
"fun play equipment".</p>
<h4>4. Think Long-Term</h4>
<p>One important consideration was the expected lack of maintenance. Basically
with a TDSB playground, it gets installed and that's it until it's time to take
it down and put up something else. Of course the staff will repair things when
they break, but you can't include a cool <a
href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/54/157107196_9d061e8dae.jpg">willow
tunnel</a> or anything that needs a lot of attention as it grows, and if you
put in planter boxes you'd better be damn sure someone is committed to
maintaining them. Bear in mind that even if the current community of parents is
committed to maintaining the playground, the next generation may not be. You
don't want to install something that's going to become a liability or an
eyesore.</p>
<h4>5. Try To Keep Your Patience</h4>
<p>Working with the TDSB was frustrating at times. It's such a large, cumbersome
organization that there doesn't seem to be good communication even within
it, let alone with the rest of the world. Three examples of this:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
It's hard to figure out which playground equipment suppliers you can use.
At one point we tried to get a list of TDSB-approved suppliers, and it seems
there is no such list. But you can't purchase equipment from just anyone.  What
we ended up doing was giving pictures of stuff we liked to the landscape
architect, and she sourced similar elements from providers she knew were
approved.</p></li>

<li>
<p>
We had one really fantastic meeting toward the end of the design process.
All the interested parties were there: designer, grounds staff, administration,
parents, teachers, and Sydney's father. It was the meeting where we made all
the final design decisions, including the specific elements and colours we
wanted.  We had two design principals: to keep the playground visually natural,
and to incorporate pink, which was Sydney's favourite colour. We chose a pink
slide and complemented it with a green frog sculpture. We also chose red for
the climbing structure (because red is kind of like pink?), and tan for the
rubbery safety surfacing around the slide and climber.  Lovely, right?
</p>

<img src="/images/amy/playground/redred.jpg" align="right" alt="Red climber, red surface, clashy clashy" title="I hope you like this red colour, because that's what you're getting.">

<p>
Well, it turns out the TDSB only uses a brick red colour for the safety
surfacing, at all their schools. We didn't find that out until they installed
it. You can imagine how great brick red looks with a pink slide and red rope
climber. If we had known that &mdash; if the TDSB staff who was at the meeting
had known that &mdash; we would have made different choices for the colours.
</p>

<p>
(Incidentally, when the frog arrived she wasn't green, she was grey. 
I don't know where the screw-up was: was she ordered wrong? Was she manufactured
wrong?)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I wanted logs. Logs are such an obvious element in a natural playground. But
the TDSB Grounds Team Leader didn't like logs. He said they attract carpenter
ants and wasps, they're a liability and no-one wants to pay to have them
removed when they rot. I had visited a playground which was built 15 years ago
and had no problems with their logs, but he was quite adamant that logs were
not an option. We ended up looking at fake logs made out of cement.</p>

<img src="/images/amy/playground/logs2.jpg" align="left" alt="Logs, bark still on, not on gravel">

<p>
And then suddenly, after months of no logs, logs <em>were</em> an option. I'm not sure
what changed, but at that same meeting when we decided on the colours, the Grounds Team leader said that he had
a source for nice hardwood logs that wouldn't rot. He said they remove the bark
from the logs, and if they install them on gravel so they're well-drained
there's no concern about rotting. Great! Let's have logs! I was really happy
about the logs.</p>

<p>And then the logs were installed. As you can see, they do not have the bark
stripped from them, and they are not installed on nice, well-drained gravel. I
have no idea what went wrong there, but obviously the Grounds Team leader's
specifications for logs were either not communicated, or not met. I'm not even
sure if the logs were from the same provider he was thinking of.</p>
</ol>

<hr width=40% />

<p>So did we end up with a natural playground? Kind of half-and-half. The
playground has lots of natural elements, including the trees which were already
there, some new shrubs we planted, the problematic logs, rocks, wooden
landscaping elements like retaining walls, stone seating, and a slide built
into a natural slope in the playground.  We also have some unnatural elements,
like the surfacing, which is required around the slide according to safety
regulations (even though the slide is at ground level!) and the climber.
And we have the frog, which is kind of emblematic of nature and just
really sweet.</p>
<p><img src="/images/amy/playground/slide.jpg" align="right" alt="Slide" title="As
you can see, the pink slide clashes with the red surfacing, but fortunately the
sandbox sand (which is about the colour of the surfacing we did want) kind of
creeps up the slope and looks better than the red."></p>
<p>Between the safety considerations, the limitations on providers, the lack of
maintenance, and the lack of understanding of the concept of natural
playgrounds, it would be very hard to have a truly natural playground in the
TDSB. But if you communicate the concepts <em>behind</em> a natural playground clearly
to your school community and convince them it's a good idea, you can get pretty
close, and you can definitely install a playground which provides a rich,
natural environment for your children to learn and grow in.</p>
