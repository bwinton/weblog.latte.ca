<strong>1. Take more pictures.</strong>  More pictures of the
girls, and more pictures of the people in my life.  My sister-in-law
has a million pictures of her friends grinning at the camera,
taken at every event she ever has or goes to, or just for the
hell of it.  I didn't used to see the point of having all
those pictures of people, but looking back I wish I had more
pictures of the people in my life, and I wish my parents had
taken more pictures of their people; I have no pictures 
of my Aunt Delphine, and only one of my maternal grandparents,
and none of my paternal.

<strong>2. Read <em>Pere Goriot</em> and <em>King Lear</em>.</strong>
If I'm going to be all snotty and literary about my children's
names the least I can do is read the damn books.  I am such a 
poser.

<strong>3. Learn to read better.</strong>  Oh, I'm fully literate,
but the stuff I read tends to bounce out of my head soon after
it goes in.  That's why I have the book log, so that I am forced
to think about each book at least once after I read it, and so
that I can refer back to the list and remember what I have read.
But I need to learn to read more deeply, to think more about
what I'm reading as I read it, and to remember it better.
To this end I would like to read <a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio/1929154178">this book</a>.  (I tried reading that <em>How
To Read and Why</em> book but it didn't help -- it was all
"why" and no "how".)

<strong>4. Learn to do the <a href="http://www.danielhsia.com/m_squat.php">Asian Squat</a>.</strong>  I spend a LOT of time squatting,
talking to Delphine, helping her with her boots and coat,
feeding the cats.  But I can't squat properly -- my heels
lift off the ground and I am left balancing on my toes,
which is very precarious.  I need to learn to do a proper
squat, and I don't understand why I can't.  I am going to
talk to my chiropractor, who is an absolute genius when
it comes to anatomy, about what I need to stretch and
strengthen to be able to do this.  And perhaps I should
watch this movie too.

<strong>5. Finish laundry the day I start.</strong>  I'm
pretty good at housework -- the place is generally fairly
clean, the kitchen gets cleaned once a day, I vacuum weekly,
I tidy up Delphine's toys every day or two, but I can't
seem to get a handle on laundry.  I wash and dry it in a
day, but then it sits unfolded in the living room for a
couple of days.  I finally fold it, and then it sits, folded,
in the living room for another day or two until I finally 
put it away, usually because I need the baskets to do more
laundry.    I don't think there is any trick to this, I think
I just need to fold and put away the damn laundry the day I
wash it.  It's a matter of self-discipline.  I hate that.
