<p>I know. It’s a bit late. I meant to post this earlier, but then life… </p>
<p>(And I realized that the reason you post your New Year’s Resolutions as soon as
you can is that it’s embarrassing to post them after you’ve already broken
them.)</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<h4>1. Increase my machine time at the gym from 20 minutes to 30 minutes.</h4>
<p>My gym routine is almost literally the least I can do: twenty minutes on a
machine, usually the elliptical, and then fifteen minutes or more of
stretching. I’m really there for the stretching, because if I don’t do it
regularly sooner or later my back goes into spasm.</p>
<p>But I figured another ten minutes can’t be too hard to come by, and a
bit more cardio three or four times a week can’t be a bad idea.</p>
<h4>2. Double-veg</h4>
<p>Another simple one: whenever I have fruit or vegetables, have twice as much.
I like fruit and vegetables, and it’s really only habit which stops me from
eating more of them.</p>
<h4>3. Write more.</h4>
<p>This is your classic poorly-planned, doomed-to-fail resolution. There is no
plan here, no list of steps, no schedule, just a vague intention to “write
more”. </p>
<p>Nothing specific, not a novel or poems or a book on the history of quick
breads, but more little things: more book reviews on Goodreads, more blog
posts, more letters to family, more entries in my journal.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this one needs more work. I don’t want to give it up,
though.</p>
