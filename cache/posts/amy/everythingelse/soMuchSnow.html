This Tuesday we were treated to a most peculiar sight; our street,
which usually has between six and ten cars parked on it, was empty
of cars but full of two Bobcats and a huge yellow snow eating/spitting
machine, and a steady succession of dump trucks being filled with snow.  We
have had so much snow this winter (a storm every three days in
February alone) that the city has given up trying to shovel it around and
is <em>trucking it away</em> to who knows where?  And in order to
get the job done they have resorted to the extreme measure of 
towing people's cars around the corner, moving the snow, then
towing the cars back (I think, or maybe they just leave the cars
where they dropped them!).  It's costing millions and it's a little
crazy, but I'm glad they did it because it was getting almost
impossible to get over the huge snowbanks at every intersection,
even with the awesome stroller.

As far as I am concerned, spring cannot come too soon this year.
Although I suspect we're in for a spell more winter yet.
