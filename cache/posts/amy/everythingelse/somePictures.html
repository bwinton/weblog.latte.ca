<p>Now that I have a walking-around camera (ie, the camera in my phone)
I don't have to look at random plants and say, "hey, that's cool, I
wonder what it is." I can take pictures and post them here and ask
everyone!</p>
<p>So what is this stuff with the little round pink and orange flower 
heads?</p>

<p>How about this red flower with big leaves?</p>

<p>I've seen this squashy-looking thing with white trumpet-shaped
flowers all over the place:</p>

<p>I also like this grass with flat seedheads:</p>
