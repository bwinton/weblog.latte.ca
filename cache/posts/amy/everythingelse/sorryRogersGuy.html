I am sorry I was rude to you.  I know you are up in the middle of
the night somewhere in India trying to convince irate Canadians
to switch to your idiotic home phone service, and you are just
doing your job and following a script, but honestly.  Do you have
to call twice a week?  In the middle of naptime?  Please just stop.

Thank you,<br />
An Irate Canadian.
