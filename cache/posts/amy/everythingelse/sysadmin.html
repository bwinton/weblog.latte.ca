<p>
July 27 is <a href="http://www.sysadminday.com/">System Administrator
Appreciation Day</a>, so in honour of my brother (who is no longer
administering sys, but did for a long time to the detriment of
his own mental health and love of humanity), my friends Jeff, Woody
(both also ex-sysamins) and Jason (who I believe does anything for
money, provided there are Macs involved), and of course my own home 
sysadmin Blake, go and buy your sysadmin a fancy coffee (or a beer).
