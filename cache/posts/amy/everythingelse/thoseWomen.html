<p>I've always wondered how they do it, those women. You know the ones,
the women who are on the board of this organization and the fundraising
committee of that, who have two children and a dog and a full-time job.
The women who do it all. How?</p>
<p>For example, the president of our School Council (PTA to you) is
a full-time lawyer, and she has two little kids. How does she manage?
Where does she find the time?
So I asked her. I did, I just asked her. And for one thing, she doesn't clean.
She has a giant house and she gets someone
in every weekend to clean. That's a whole day of cleaning, probably
$200 a week or so. Of course she has childcare: she has a nice young
woman who looks after the kids and probably does light
housekeeping too. I don't know what else she doesn't do, but she's
not averse to spending money so I bet she pays people to 
do quite a lot of mundane crap. I know I would if I could manage it.</p>
<p>I know dozens of these women with full-time jobs and children
who none-the-less
manage to take on huge volunteer roles in the school, or in other
organizations.  They don't all have money, so it can't be that
they all outsource all that time-consuming everyday crap.
And yet here I am, with my two kids and not much else on my
plate, barely making it through each day. Why?  There's nothing in
particular wrong with me, that I know of. What do these other
women have that I lack? Time? Ambition? Passion? Amphetamines?</p>
<p>Finally I decided that rather than try and work this out 
deductively I would just run an experiment.  I would go ahead 
and sign myself up for
a bunch of stuff and see what broke.</p>
<p>So this year, I'm chair of the school's Eco-Committee. (So far we've
had one meeting, submitted a grant proposal, and sent a lot of email.)
I'm working on the Crafts booth for our school Winter Fair.
I'm class parent for Delphine's class, I help out in the library
for two hours every two weeks, and I get to school at 8 am on 
Thursdays to help with Junior Choir. I run twice a week.  I have 
choir, and book club,
and that whole "writing career" thing I said I would get started
on.  I still have two children and a cat to look
after, and a house to run. 
Oh, and I have friends who sometimes I like to hang out with, and
a husband who, frankly, I barely ever talk to about anything other
than household administrivia. And I like to watch TV. And read&mdash;a lot. 
And there's this blog. And the eight hours of sleep that I really,
really enjoy.</p>
<p>Under all that weight, something's bound to break. Perhaps it will
be sleep. Perhaps it will be housework. Perhaps it will be one of
my new responsibilities. Perhaps it will be my mental
health. Or perhaps it will turn out that I'm one of those women who can
do it all. Perhaps all I needed to do was try.</p>
