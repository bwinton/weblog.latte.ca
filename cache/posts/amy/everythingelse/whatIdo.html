<p>That last post got me thinking about what I do. Is this
interesting to anyone else? I don't know.</p>
<h4>At Home</h4>
<ul>
<li>cook</li>
<li>clean</li>
<li>laundry</li>
<li>read to and play with the girls</li>
<li>read</li>
<li>watch TV</li>
<li>write</li>
<li>play on the Internet: mainly read blogs, Twitter</li>
<li>sleep</li>
<li>garden</li>
<li>hang out with friends</li>
</ul>
<h3>Out and About</h3>
<ul>
<li>take girls to school and other activities</li>
<li>choir</li>
<li>run</li>
<li>grocery shopping and other errands</li>
<li>PTA meetings</li>
<li>book club meetings</li>
<li>visit friends</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it, apart from occasional major chores like painting, 
and occasional events like weddings and parties.  Seems like a pretty 
simple life, which is the way I like it. Otherwise I get
confused.</p>
