A couple of weeks ago, after I read that Silken Laumann book,
I realized that I no longer had any excuse not to take a
running clinic at The Running Room.  
I had thought for a while about taking a clinic, thought about it, 
planned to do it at some unspecified point in the future...
and suddenly I realized that that point was now.
Cordelia is old enough
that she can be away from me for a while, and Blake is
more than willing to look after her and Delphine
while I go out running.
</p><p>
So I signed up for the Learn To Run clinic, a ten-week
program that promises to take the slobbiest
slob and render them capable of running a 5K.
I dug out
my old running shoes and showed up 
the first Saturday, 8:30 in the morning.  
I was full of energy, keen
to go, had been up for hours already!  I ran, I walked,
it was great, it was easier than I thought, I loved
being out in the fresh air first thing in the morning
before all the crowds.  I went for a practice run 
that Monday,
and then for a bike ride with Blake on Thursday.  
I was feeling 
good, healthy, my back was feeling looser and
less painful than it had in years.
</p><p>
Okay, my knee was a little sore on the bike ride,
but hey!  My knees are always a little sore!
Arthritis, right?  Getting some exercise and losing
weight will only help, right?  So I went to the clinic
and ran again -- it was still good, but a little harder
this week.  Oh, and they mentioned that you should 
really get new shoes after you have babies because
your feet change.  Oh.
</p><p>
By then my knee really hurt, but I walked
the twenty-minute walk home, then back up to the
store again later that day to buy new shoes, and
home again.  (I am really stupid.)
</p><p>
My knee still hurt by Wednesday -- all the time,
whether I was walking or running or just sitting -- 
so I went to see my physical therapist.  And as
it turns out, I have injured the cartilage in my
knee and I won't be able to run for at least a
couple of weeks, if ever.  (The "if ever" part
we will find out through a process of trial and
error, lucky me.)  
</p><p>
And in the meantime, I have to stay off my feet
as much as possible;
no trip to the store, no
trip to the library to pick up the books I have
on hold there.  It's a blessing that
Starbucks is just across the street, that's all
I say.  The irony is that I started this trying to
get fit, and here I am more sedentary than ever.
</p><p>
Oh woe, oh woe, but at least I am not dead.  
(A friend of a friend was killed in a horseback
riding accident last weekend, a timely reminder
that it could always be worse.)
