Another gastronomic breakthrough for Delphine today; we both
had the same thing for lunch, Habitant Pea Soup.  I thought it
was time to introduce Delphine to the lard food group.

She also had bananas, yogurt and rice cereal mashed up, for dessert.
I had cucumber sandwiches on thinly sliced, homemade oat bread with
a chutney and horseradish mayonnaise.  Sometimes I eat fancy.

In other food news, I'm still trying to redeem my averages from
Christmas, and the post-Christmas leftover eating.  It doesn't
help that on Friday I had a three thousand calorie day.  The horrifying
thing is that it wasn't all that hard; pastry for breakfast, 
a jam sandwich as an afternoon snack, a grande mocha for a treat after
Blake got home, pizza and wings for supper and a half-cup of
frozen yogurt for dessert.  Any of those things alone would be
reasonable, but when you have them all in one day...  Well, three
thousand calories.

It makes me realize that I must have had a lot of three thousand
calorie days back when I wasn't paying attention.  Sort of
explains the 240 lb thing; genetics, my ass.

In an attempt to get my averages back in line, and also as an
experiment, I had a sixteen hundred  calorie day on 
Saturday.  Also, surprisingly, not that hard.  Toast and tea
for breakfast, hot and sour soup for lunch, another mocha 
(tall this time), and salad for supper, but a tasty salad
with facon and egg and cheese.  We even had dessert, custard
made with skim milk.  There's hope yet.
