Today we had Morgan and Erik over for a Passover/Easter feast.  Morgan
made saucy chicken and chopped liver, and I made fruit kugel and 
Passover brownies and roasted asparagus.  (The asparagus was an afterthought
when I realized we didn't have any vegetables.)  We also had Easter
eggs with the brownies for dessert.

The recipes for Morgan's saucy chicken and my kugel both came out of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0969797206/102-4098737-5815362?v=glance">the yellow book</a> and they both turned out really well.
The Passover brownies were made from my mother-in-law's recipe.  They
didn't turn out so well because they didn't cook through;  I didn't
realize until this morning when I tried to turn them out of the pan.  I 
glued the whole mess together with Glossy Chocolate Frosting made from
a recipe in my old Betty Crocker book, and it worked really well.  I
thought the whole meal turned out great, considering all the recipes we
used were new to us.

We all ate and ate until we couldn't move, and then squeezed in a little
more, and now I'm <em>so</em> tired.  It was good; I love holiday food.
