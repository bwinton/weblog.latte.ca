<p>Here's a recipe for Apricot Prune Kugel for Passover. Baba said
she isn't making kugel this year because she's making a turkey and
stuffing it and the stuffing is just the same as kugel. So I'll make
kugel. </p>
<p>I looked for the recipe and couldn't find it, so I asked on Twitter but
no-one's suggestion looked quite right. (Kugel means different things to
different people.) Then I looked in my cookbook again and realized the recipe
was just formatted weird, and I actually do have it.  So I'm posting it here
for the interest of googlers everywhere.</p>
