This is the world's best chocolate cake recipe -- it's
really easy, it always
comes out moist and rich and delicious, and best of all it
calls for cocoa powder, which I always have in the house,
not unsweetened chocolate, which I never have.  Use the
leftover buttermilk to make pancakes.

excellent results.

2 cups confectioner's sugar<br />
1&frac12; teaspoons vanilla<br />

Mix thoroughly butter and cocoa.  Blend in sugar.
Stir in vanilla and milk; beat until frosting is
smooth and of spreading consistency.

Fills and frosts two 8- or 9-inch layers or frosts
a 13x9 inch cake.
