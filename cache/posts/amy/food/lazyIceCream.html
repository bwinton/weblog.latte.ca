Put some frozen blueberries in a bowl.  (I like
<a href="http://www.europesbest.com/">Europe's Best</a>
if you can get them.)  Pour in just enough whipping
cream to almost cover the berries.  Wait a few seconds
and the berries will freeze the cream -- voila, quick 
frosty goodness that's almost good for you!
