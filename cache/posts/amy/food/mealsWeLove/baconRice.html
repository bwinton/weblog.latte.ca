<p>Wednesdays are tricky, dinner-wise. Delphine's art class ends at 5:15, which
means we're usually not home until 5:45 or 6:00. Dinner is at 6:00.
(Theoretically.) If I'm extra clever and don't get distracted by work,
I put something in the crock pot and set the table in advance so we can
sit right down and eat. Yesterday I wasn't extra clever.</p>
<p>We got home at 5:45 and there was nothing cooking anywhere, but I did
have an idea. It started with half a pound of <a href="http://www.perthporkproducts.com/">Perth Pork</a> bacon. Any idea that starts with Perth Pork bacon is a good idea.</p>
<p>I cut the bacon into little bits and fried it up. When it was starting
to get crispy I (reluctantly) poured off about half the fat. Then I 
added a cup of arborio rice to the pan and mixed it up. I minced two
cloves of garlic and added that, then I poured in two cups of chicken
broth, put the lid on and walked away for about twelve minutes.</p>
<p>When I came back, I added a cup of frozen peas and a large tomato,
cubed, and also a bit more water since the rice wasn't quite done.
I put the lid on, let that simmer for another couple of minutes, and
then served it with that cheap "parmesan" in a can.</p>
<p>It was delicious and beloved; everyone had seconds. (Cordelia ate around
the tomatoes.) Delphine took some for lunch today. Yay! Dinner victory!</p>
