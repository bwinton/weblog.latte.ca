<p>Yesterday's meal was Cordelia's "favourite meal ever! Can you make this
<em>every day</em>!?"</p>
<ul>
<li>sausages - we had lean turkey sausages, which the children declared they
  didn't love. "They're not very juicy."</li>
<li>mashed potatoes mashed with plain yogurt</li>
<li>frozen peas and corn (I was running out of time!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Simple and popular.</p>
