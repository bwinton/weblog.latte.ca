<p>Usually the dinners I cook are greeted with something between
indifference and disgust by my children, but occasionally I
put something on the table which is greeted with delight and
devoured with gusto. Yesterday was one of those days;  this
is what I served:</p>
<ul>
<li>crockpot chicken and salsa (throw boneless skinless chicken thighs
  in the crockpot with a jar of salsa, cook until done)</li>
<li>brown rice (I use Dainty Time-Wise (tm) brown rice which only takes 15
  minutes to cook)</li>
<li>avocado mashed with lime juice and salt and pepper</li>
<li>Ace Bakery ciabatta (aka "the world's best bread" according to
  Delphine) and butter</li>
<li>cherry tomatoes from this summer's backyard harvest</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone had seconds. Some of us might have had thirds.</p>
