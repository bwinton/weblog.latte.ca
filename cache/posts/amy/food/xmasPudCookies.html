<p>On Wednesday, I made my Christmas puddings. I know it seems early 
to make Christmas anything, but you have to let Christmas puddings
hang around for a while after you make them. Like, a couple of months.
Also you have to stay on top of
Christmas or it will kick your ass. </p>
<p>I always have to do a special trip to the bulk food store to buy all
the preserved fruit that goes into Christmas pudding, and no matter how 
hard I try to buy the right amount, I always
end up with piles of leftover raisins and candied peel and slivered almonds
after the puddings are made. I don't know about you, but I don't
have that much use for candied peel and slivered almonds in my day-to-day
life. Usually they sit around until July and then I throw them out.
This year I was determined to do better.</p>
<p>I tried to think of some context (besides Christmas pudding) in
which candied peel, almonds and raisins aren't, well, kind of gross, and 
I kept coming back to 
shortbread cookies. I don't know if I've had shortbread cookies with
all that stuff in them, or if I just made it up, but in
my head it made sense. I couldn't find a recipe for exactly what
I had in mind, but I found a Martha Stewart
recipe for 
<a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/rum-raisin-shortbread">rum raisin shortbread cookies</a> to get me started.</p>
<p>I used raisins instead of currants because raisins were what I had too
much of (I managed to buy the exact right amount of currants).
I used lemon zest instead of orange zest because that's what I had,
and because there's lemon zest in my Christmas pudding. I substituted
rum for the vanilla because I wanted to make them as rummy and
Christmassy as possible, and instead of the shredded coconut I put
in &frac14; cup slivered almonds and &frac12; cup candied peel.</p>
<p>They turned out perfectly, just as I had imagined them. They're
very Christmassy and rich; Christmas Pudding in cookie form. Here's
the recipe:</p>
<h3>Christmas Pudding Shortbread Cookies</h3>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul>
<li>&frac12; cup dark rum</li>
<li>1 cup raisins</li>
<li>&frac12; pound unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
<li>&frac34; cup confectioners' sugar</li>
<li>&frac12; teaspoon finely grated lemon zest</li>
<li>1 &frac12; cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>&frac14; cup slivered almonds</li>
<li>&frac12; cup chopped candied peel</li>
<li>1 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
</ul>
<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Combine rum and raisins; cover, and let stand at room 
temperature overnight. Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon rum.</li>
<li>Beat butter, sugar, and lemon zest with a mixer on medium speed 
until creamy and smooth, about 2 minutes. Add reserved rum, and beat 
until combined. Reduce speed to low. Add flour and salt, and beat for 
3 minutes. Stir in raisins, almonds and candied peel by hand.</li>
<li>Form dough into 2 logs, each about 1 &frac12; inches in diameter; 
wrap in parchment, and refrigerate 1 hour (or up to 3 days).</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 325. Remove parchment. Slice logs into 
&frac14;-inch-thick rounds, and space about 1 inch apart on baking 
sheets lined with parchment. Bake until pale golden, about 20 
minutes. Let cool. Cookies can be stored in an airtight container for 
up to 1 week.</li>
