<p>Yesterday Blake taught Delphine about contrails.  This
morning we were out walking and she looked up into the
clear blue Hallowe'en sky and saw a plane.  "It has a
cotton-trail!"</p>
<hr>
<p>We were talking about everyone's costumes.  "Mrs
Thompson was a lady who works in a
church.  The ladies who wear necklaces with a criss-cross
thing on."  I love that my kid doesn't even know
what a cross is.  (Mrs Thompson was a nun.)</p>
<hr>
<p>Cordelia and I were reading <em>Dr Suess's ABC</em>:  "Big
A, little a, what begins with A?"  </p>
<p>"AMY!"  </p>
<p>"Aunt Annie's alligator, A..a..A.  Big B, little B, what
begins with B?"  </p>
<p>"BLAKE!"  </p>
<p>"Barber, baby, bubbles, and
a bumblebee."  And so on with Cordelia chiming in
whenever she knew someone with that letter.  After
C ("CORDELIA!"), D ("DELPHINE!") and E ("ERIK!") she
said "Almost everyone we know has a letter in this
book!"</p>
<p>Yeah, almost!</p>

<p>Delphine and I were talking about meat today, because
we were walking over to a friend's house to pick up
a quarter cow.  She asked if someone killed the cow, 
and I said that they did.  </p>
<p>"That's sad.  We should
be nice to animals."</p>
<p>"That's true.  But then we couldn't eat meat."</p>
<p>"Meat is tasty."</p>
<p>"Some people don't like to kill animals, so they don't
eat meat.  They're called vegetarians."</p>
<p>"But meat is so tasty!"</p>
<p>"I know!  It's a hard decision to make."</p>
<p>So we talked about how Daddy and I decided to keep
eating meat but to try and make sure that the cows
and chickens and other animals we eat are happy
when they're alive, hence the trek to pick up 
cow.</p>
<hr>
<p>Not my kid but my friend's kid (and my kid's friend)
Ursa.  Yesterday they were eating a Chinese beef
dish and Ursa said "I like this dark brown chicken!"
(Good thing, because they got a quarter cow too.)
What's the deal with kids thinking everything is
chicken?  The other day Cordelia called tilapia chicken.
The kids at daycare used to call tofu chicken.
No wonder everything tastes like chicken, it's because
chicken tastes like everything!</p>
