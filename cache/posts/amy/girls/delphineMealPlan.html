<p>Delphine has gotten to be pretty picky at the dinner
table, and after one too many "I hate this!"es, Blake
and I decided to let Delphine pick every dinner this
week. Blake walked her through picking things that
are on sale, and he also advised her on the standard
protein-vegetable-starch distribution of a meal.</p>
<p>So this is what we're having this week. Try and guess
which words Delphine wrote and which were Blake's (Blake
likes Random Capitalization and Punctuation):</p>
<ul>
<li>Mashed Potatoes &amp; Hot Dogs AND (charred) ESPARAGIS</li>
<li>Pizza with Pepperoni &amp; Tomato</li>
<li>Chicken Sandwiches &amp; cut up apples &amp; Corn on the cob.</li>
<li>Burritos (Beans, tomato, cooked carrots, cheese)</li>
<li>SRINP ring AND GRILD cheese SANWICHES BOK CHOY???</li>
</ul>
<p>Should be a tasty week.</p>
