<p>This just happened.  Delphine and Cordelia have been
fighting all day, apart from some nice long breaks for
<em>Sesame Street</em> and <em>Dora</em>. Finally the television
ends and after some brief spats Cordelia settles down
on the couch looking at a book, and Delphine comes to
the dining table to colour.</p>
<p>After not three minutes of peace, Delphine says, out
of the blue, with no provocation whatsoever, "You've
been looking at that book for a long time, Cordelia!"</p>
<p>So I said, "She must find it very interesting." Trying
to pretend we're all normal human beings who don't pick
at each other for the sheer joy of it.</p>
<p>Delphine: "It seems boring to me!"</p>
<p>Yet more fighting ensues. Why?  Why?! They were doing fine
and then Delphine out and out picked a fight! I swear
sometimes I feel like wringing their little fucking 
necks.</p>

<p>Delphine just came over to show me the picture she
coloured in for me, with fish and a little pink bird.
She's sweet. Her little neck is safe.</p>
