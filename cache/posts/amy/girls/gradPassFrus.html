<p>Both the girls "graduated" last week, Delphine from Senior Kindergarten,
and Cordelia from Nursery School. There is some division
of opinion on these early graduations: Some people seem to think
they're idiotic&mdash;graduating from kindergarten?! Seriously?&mdash;while
others, mostly parents, think they're charming. I'm in the latter
camp: a rite of passage is a rite of passage, even if you're
only three feet tall. Both Cordelia's life and Delphine's are
going to be very different in September, and I think that's 
worth acknowledging.</p>
<p>Cordelia is starting Junior Kindergarten in fall, in the mornings.
We haven't met her teacher yet because she's going to be new
to the school, and I have no idea who else is going to be in 
her class. All we know is which room she's going to be in.
She's familiar with the school, though, from dropping off
and picking up Delphine for the last two years. She's thrilled
to be going to "my sister's school". (She refers to Delphine
almost exclusively as "my sister".)</p>
<p>Delphine is starting Grade One in fall, and we'll find out 
tomorrow who her teacher is going to be. She's alternately
scared and excited about Grade One. I'm excited about finally
being able to buy school supplies.</p>
<hr />
<p>Cordelia has a new passion: chewing gum. I always used to
judge, a teeny bit, people who let little kids chew
gum, but as in so many ways, I have become that which I 
judged. I have to limit her to one piece of gum a day. She
likes the minty kinds.</p>
<p>Delphine's new passion is <em>Dirty Jobs</em>, which she likes to
watch every day. I figure it's an informative window
into the grown-up world, and it will give her some idea of 
how much work goes into making the food and objects which
appear in our house. And into cleaning skulls and preparing
owl pellets. She calls Mike Rowe "Mark".</p>
<hr />
<p>Delphine and Cordelia were enjoying a marathon TV session
on Saturday morning, when <em>Saddle Club</em> came on. <em>Saddle Club</em>
is one of those cheap soap operas in which Australia seems
to specialise&mdash;this one is set at some kind of horsey school
and is aimed at, I assume, "tweens". Delphine doesn't watch
it regularly but she enjoys it when she catches it. I think it's
rubbish, and when it came on I huffed and rolled my eyes. 
Delphine said, "What?"</p>
<p>"I don't like this show. There's too much melodrama and people
getting upset with each other."</p>
<p>Blake cut in with, "They don't talk to each other about their
problems, they just get mad."</p>
<p>I said, "No-one acts like that in real life."</p>
<p>Delphine gazed at us levelly. "Maybe they just want to make it
exciting."</p>
<p>Well, I guess I don't need to worry about her media awareness.</p>
<hr />
<p>I went to Value Village today. (Blake stayed home and looked
after the children, so they don't appear in this story. Sorry.)
My mum sent me some money for my birthday, because I said I
wanted to buy myself some new clothes.  I thought the money would
go further if I shopped at VV instead of Addition-Elle or
Lands' End.</p>
<p>The trouble with living in a middle-class neighbourhood 
surrounded by more middle-class neighbourhoods
is that you have to travel a long way to get to a second-hand store.
My second-hand-shopping maven friend told me that the
Value Village at Landsdown is the best one, so off I trekked. A
bus trip (it was too hot to walk to the subway station) and
a long subway ride (with a transfer!) later, I arrived at Landsdown.
I can't comment on how nice the Landsdown area is, because it
was 30 degrees today and there's a municipal strike on; I 
imagine every Toronto neighbourhood looked like shit today.</p>
<p>The Value Village at Landsdown is huge, it's like a small
Zellers. I managed to find beautiful dresses for the girls to
wear to the two weddings we're invited to this summer, and then
I started shopping for myself.</p>
<p>How is it possible that I'm too fat to be a size 18 in the
dress section, but too thin to be a size 20? (Also why are there
so many ugly dresses? Did the <em>Golden Girls</em> Fan Club and
Drag Show recently clean out its closet?) Further, how is
it then possible that I can be too thin to be a size 18 in the
pants section? How is it possible that there was only one
cute dress that fit me, but dozens of sweaters and shirts? Do
fat women not buy cute dresses? Or do they buy them and then
hang on to them for dear life?</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing was how unevenly placed the sizes
were; I found clothes that fit me (and many more that didn't) 
in the size 16, size 18 
and size 20 sections. Some of those clothes had the original
store size labels on, and the VV staff had faithfully placed
the clothes in the section that matched the label. Which, of
course, is a failure. I'm an XL at Cotton Ginny, 
a L at Tabi, and a 1X at Addition-Elle, but I don't fit into
Reitman's XL, or really most other labels' XL. I'm a 16 pant 
at Lands' End and a 18 at Addition-Elle. So even if you
do place clothes in the label-appropriate section, you won't 
get consistency in section sizes.</p>
<p>VV has a chance to correct the vagaries of women's clothing 
sizes; surely it would be simple to have a template in the
back room against which staff could hold up each donated
item of clothing,
to sort it into the right bin. Even if you only picked one
dimension&mdash;waist for pants, say, and bust for 
dresses&mdash;once you found the size that matched your body, 
you would be one variable closer to finding something that fit.</p>
<p>This was only my second VV trip, and I think I've decided it
isn't worth it. It's a long trip to get there, it took me 
forever to find clothes to try on, I had to wait for a change
room, and then only about
fifteen percent of them fit. And after all that, of course, it's
another long way to come home again. If there were a location
nearer to here I might go again&mdash;they're opening some
new locations, but I fear we are too embedded in Richville to
ever get a thrift shop nearby.</p>
<p>After all that, I didn't even find a dress for myself to wear
to the weddings. Tomorrow I will call the local consignment
stores (without much hope) to see whether they carry my size.
I expect I will end up going to Addition-Elle, which is no
loss; I still have a good chunk of my birthday money left.
(That's the great thing about VV: two sweaters, three shirts,
one pair of pants, two pairs of earrings, a hat, and two 
kid's dresses for $70. Seriously!)</p>
