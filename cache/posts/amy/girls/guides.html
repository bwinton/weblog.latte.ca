<p>I'm trying to decide if we should keep Delphine in Sparks 
next year. (Sparks is the
precursor to Brownies, for 5- to 6-year-olds.) Delphine has
been in Sparks for the last year, and now the time has 
come to sign up for next year.  But I have serious qualms.  </p>
<p>Guides is supposed to be about empowering girls and
allowing them to build confidence, and yet they're going
about it all wrong. The organization decides what girls
should be interested in (by making badges available), 
decides how they should go about exploring those 
interests (the bullet-point items you have to fulfill
before getting a badge) and then rewards them for
their interest. Rewarding kids for things is a <em>proven
demotivator</em>. And worse, in Sparks the girls haven't
even had a chance to express their own interests: the
meetings are predetermined at the beginning of the
year. The girls' interests don't even come into play!
It's incredibly disappointing to see a great
opportunity to excite and engage girls be squandered
because the adults involved lack the knowledge or
imagination to do things differently.</p>
<p>Of course it's a giant crapshoot how good your troop is
going to be because the Guide organization doesn't provide
all that much, well, guidance on how to plan and run meetings.
You might get amazing leaders who do know how to motivate
and engage kids, or your girls might be stuck with a group
of unruly kids led by frustrated adults yelling at them to shut
up and get on with the Pointless Craft of the Day.</p>
<p>And if that weren't annoying enough, you have to sign an
idiotic release form every time the troop does anything
out of the ordinary. If the organization is that risk-averse,
how are they going to help my girls become fearless?</p>
<p>Finally it's expensive. The annual fee is $125, there's a $1 dues
  charge at every meeting, and twice a year we have to pay
  $96 for those lousy cookies (and then dispose of them as we see fit).
  Plus we had to buy a shirt and sash. I suppose compared to
the $250 or so that we spend on most 12-week programs Guides
isn't actually all the pricey, but they seem to keep leeching
at us all year instead of just once up front.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Delphine really enjoys it. But then
she really enjoys 
watching Backyardigans and eating gummy worms too.</p>
