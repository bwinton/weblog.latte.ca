<p>This evening at dinner Blake was talking to Cordelia about
names. He asked what her name is. She replied "Cordelia
Winton!" (It's not.) He asked her what Delphine's name is:
"Delphine Winton!" He asked her what my name is: "Mummy
Winton!"</p>

<p>Delphine is at Auntie Morgan's place for her birthday sleepover
tonight. They went out for dinner, and tomorrow they're going
to Sunnybrook Park, among other things. Sunnybrook Park was
Delphine's choice, even though I don't think she's ever been
there. I hope it lives up to her expectations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Cordelia is home with us for a sleepunder. One of
the perks of a sleepunder is getting to choose dinner&mdash;we
had Chinese. Another is that you get to sleep in the Big Bed
if you want to. So far no-one has ever taken us up on the Big
Bed thing, but Cordelia's in the Big Bed right now. (It's nine
o' clock and she's not asleep yet, so she may yet end up sleeping
in her own bed.)</p>
<p>Tomorrow we might go out for breakfast, but we spent a lot
of money on dinner so maybe not. The school in which Cordelia's
nursery school is located is having their spring fair, so we
might go to that too. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>It was pleasant having only Cordelia tonight. She's 
charming and funny and nice to be around. Oddly (not
really) when Delphine is around they're both annoying about
forty percent of the time. Yet Delphine is great by herself too;
we hung out together this morning at Yonge and Eg and she
wasn't annoying or snotty, she was mellow and interesting and
engaged. Blake and I thought there could
be a real future in a boarding school with a Sibling 
Mutual Exclusivity Schedule Option.</p>

<p>The other day Delphine and I had a long conversation about
World Wars. It started when we stopped to look at an old
print of a WWII battleship in a storefront on Mount Pleasant.
Delphine wanted to know who started the war, who fought,
how they fought, who won. The whole conversation made me
realize how little I know about it&mdash;I guess it's time
for a trip to the library... We talked about different kinds
of guns, about guns on airplanes, about tanks.  I told her 
about attacks on cities. I told her about the
Enigma machine. We talked about what Daddy would do if there
was another World War&mdash;we decided we hope he would stay
home and work the computers, not go into battle.</p>
<p>It was an interesting conversation. It reminded me once again
about the incredibly huge amount of knowledge you have to 
absorb before you can even begin to understand our world. I
mean, not only do you have to know about the World Wars, you
also have to know about the Holocaust and slavery and the
Black Death. You have to know about The Beatles and Elvis
and Queen and Fred Astaire and tap dancing. You have to know
about gasoline and dinosaurs and planets and the atmosphere.
You have to know how to wash cotton, how to cook rice, how
to floss, how to make a new friend, how to approach a strange
dog, how to use the phone and the library. The human brain 
is astonishing.  I'm reminded of that when Delphine and 
I come up against some huge body of knowledge which she's 
hardly begun to explore. There's so much for her to 
learn. But she's made a pretty good start.</p>
<p>Apparently the World Wars conversation has provided
plenty of playtime fodder. The following day Delphine told
me that she and Pierce and Jaime played castles in school,
and they bombed and shot at each other's castles. What fun!</p>
