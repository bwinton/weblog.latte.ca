<p>I have a confession to make. For the last few months, I have
seriously worried that I might like one of my children more
than the other. On the one hand I had Delphine, irritable,
emotional, and bossy; on the other, I had Cordelia, amiable,
charming and fun. (Also little and cute.) Obviously I love them 
both, but Cordelia was a lot easier to be around than Delphine. </p>
<p>And then Cordelia changed. She's still funny and cute (and little), 
but she's gone all intense. She's at that age now, where if
you cut her toast wrong, or put the applesauce on top
of the yoghurt, or put the left shoe on before the right, she
freaks out, sobbing until whatever it is is put right or you
manage to make her laugh. The other night she didn't want to go
to bed, and she had a stereotypical toddler tantrum, screaming
and kicking and yelling, for a good ten minutes. We had honestly
never had one of those, with either Cordelia or Delphine.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this change in behaviour is a developmental
stage, or if it's simple that we gave up naps a week or so ago
and she's still adjusting. Before this she'd always been a happy,
easy-going baby, but I remember Delphine going from 
Straightforward to Complicated sometime in the preschool years.
Parenting a baby and toddler is a physical endeavour, carrying 
and feeding and wiping. Parenting a child is emotional 
and mental and completely different. I think I now have two
children.</p>
<p>Thank goodness&mdash;I don't think I could have pretended
they were both equally easy and fun for much longer.</p>
