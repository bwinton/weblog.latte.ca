<p>The girls are six and nine now, and they are starting to hear pop music
at camp and at their friends houses.  When we were in Saskatchewan they
asked me to make mix CDs for them, and they both requested a few songs.
I padded their choices with a few tunes of my own, and here's what they
ended up with:</p>
<h4>Delphine's 2012 Summer Mix CD</h4>

<dl>
<dt>"Call Me Maybe", Carly Rae Jepsen</dt>
<dt>"Black Horse & Cherry Tree", K.T. Tunstall</dt>
<dt>"Mama Said", The Shirelles</dt><dd>Marmoset!</dd>
<dt>"Drinking Games", Library Voices</dt>
    <dd>CBC Saskatchewan is really great about playing local music
    on their morning show, and we heard this while we were hanging out
    in my mum's room having our morning tea.

    to these days, and the lovely <a
