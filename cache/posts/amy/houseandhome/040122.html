Somehow, inexplicably, I have nothing to do.  There is no
pressing housework, I have no paperwork to do, I can't knit
because it takes too much concentration and unbroken blocks
of time, I've read and read and read until my eyes are bleeding.

I guess it's not inexplicable.  Christmas is over and there
isn't another errand-intensive event like that in the forseeable
future.  More significantly, Delphine now plays by herself for
reasonably long stretches of time, so jobs that used to take 
hours to do in between attending to her, now take a few minutes.
My last problem is that this wintery weather is stretching
on interminably, and I have nasty cabin fever.  I've been hiding
inside, only going out for necessities, for weeks now and I'm
tired of it.

Fortunately, next week is rich with activities;  Monday is
choir, Tuesday I'm trying to set up a board games night, 
Wednesday morning is playgroup, Thursday I'm going to see
Ellen and Dexter, and Friday is a baby storytime at the
Mount Pleasant library.  If that doesn't keep me amused,
or at least busy, nothing will.
