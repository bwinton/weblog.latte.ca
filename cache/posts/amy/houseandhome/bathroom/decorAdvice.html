The Amazing Two Bathroom Home-Value-Inflating Reno Extravaganza
is plodding along nicely. The basement powder room is framed out,
the plumbing and electrical are roughed in and the drywall is 
up. (Oddly enough the guys who hang the drywall are not the guys
who tape and plaster it, so we're in between those two stages
at the moment.)</p>
<p>But I digress. This post exists to ask for your help. We're totally
redecorating the upstairs bathroom and I have exhausted my teeny tiny
decorating muscles.</p>
<p>As you can see in the collage above, the floor tile is 
<a href="http://www.olympiatile.com/products/porcelain/unglazed_porcelain/tropical_grass.html">a kind of stripey grey (it's the "White" colour)</a>, in
12" by 24" rectangles. </p>
<p>We're tiling the walls halfway up with <a href="http://www.olympiatile.com/products/glass/cristallo.html">elongated glass subway tile</a> (4" x 16"), mainly
white with about 15% bottle green, and a few tiles-worth of white
square mosaic tiles in there for texture (and because Delphine really likes
them).</p>
<p>The bathtub is really plain and rectangular. The sink is 
<a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/80178693">Ikea's
Vitviken</a>. (Or perhaps I should say sinkS! Whoo!) The vanity
is shiny and white and plain, the medicine cabinet is shiny and plain,
the faucets are shiny and sleek and apparently not discussed anywhere on the
Internet (but <a href="/images/amy/bathroomReno/kamato.jpg">here's</a> the
box).</p>
<p>So what colour paint is going to work with the bottle green tiles? Find
me a shower curtain the softens up all that sleek shininess. Tell me
what else I need! Shop for me, my pretties!</p>
