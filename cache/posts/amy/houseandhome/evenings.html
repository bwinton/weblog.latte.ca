It recently became obvious that Delphine doesn't need to go
to bed at six-thirty any more.  We put her to bed, bright-eyed
and fresh, and she sat up and read books, or popped
out at regular intervals to make contrived requests: "Mummy!
I need sumpin'."  "What do you need?"  "I need another buddy
(stuffed toy)."  Uh-huh.
</p><p>
Since we had been feeding her supper at five
and then making and eating our supper after she was in bed, we
couldn't really move her bedtime any later unless we included
her in our supper, which we have done.  She sits on the 
counter and watches while we cook, or joins in and helps;
yesterday she swished the lettuce around in the cold
water to rinse off all the delightful organic lettuce
goo.  And then she eats with us; we all sit at the 
big table and make conversation like a real family.  I'm
fairly excited about this &mdash; I think eating together
is one of the nicest things you can do as a family, and
I have been looking forward to this for a long time.

It kind of hoses our evenings, though.  When Delphine 
went to bed early we could tuck her in and then
eat supper in front of the television like slobs.  It's
an appalling habit, and I suppose it's good that we
don't do it any more, but it was very efficient and
allowed for plenty of TV-watching.  With Delphine 
in bed at 
seven-thirty or eight that only leaves us a couple of
hours to tidy the kitchen and watch TV before it's
time for bed, since I am trying to get into bed before
ten so I can get enough sleep before the Cordelia wake-up
call at five-thirty in the morning.  If you take away 
half an hour for a run and another twenty minutes for
an epsom salts bath, that barely leaves enough time for
last night's <em>Daily Show</em>.  I am turning into one of those
people who are too busy, even if it's only too busy
to watch television.

It also means I have to put together a good repertoire
of quick and easy meals, which I suppose is par for the
course for people with children.

Here's our evening routine, a snapshot of life with a baby and
a three-year-old:
</p><p>
<strong>4:30</strong> pick Delphine up from daycare (when applicable)<br />
<strong>5:00</strong> snack for Delphine and I, supper for Cordelia<br />
<strong>6:00</strong> Cordelia's bedtime &mdash; sometime between 6:00 and 7:00
Blake gets home from work<br />
<strong>6:30</strong> make dinner<br />
<strong>7:00</strong> eat dinner<br />
<strong>7:30</strong> Delphine's bedtime: pyjamas, pee, brush teeth, read
two books, watch two movies on Daddy's computer, bed<br />
<strong>8:00</strong> I go for run (three days a week) while Blake cleans
up after dinner (yeah!)<br />
<strong>8:30</strong> home for dessert and TV<br />
<strong>9:30</strong> bath and read a book<br />
<strong>10:00</strong> bed<br />
