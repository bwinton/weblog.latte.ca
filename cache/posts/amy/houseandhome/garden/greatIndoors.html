I was in the garden this morning hanging out some washing.  It's
a nice sunny day and the kids were enjoying themselves in the
garden, so I decided I would water the plants (as per
J'Anne's advice, and the strawberry was looking a little limp).  I
know midday is not the ideal time to water plants, but when you
have little kids you go to war with the schedule you have, not the
schedule you want.

First, though, I cleaned up a dog poo in my garlic patch.  (Must
see about getting fences on the back and front.)  After I watered,
I was pulling up weeds around the garlic and cherry tomatoes
when I saw two more dog poops, and then immediately was stung
by a huge stinging nettle plant growing merrily by the maple
tree.

So I gave up, rounded up the children and we're going to stay
in the safe, cool, low-UV poop-free (mainly) indoors for the rest of
the day.  And I will figure out how to tackle the nettles. 
Unless we go to Starbucks.
