I was out inspecting my garden this afternoon and I found that
two of my zucchini mounds are growing little seedlings!  I
realize growing zucchini is not normally considered an accomplishment,
but it's the first of the things I have put into this garden that
has actually grown, so I am fairly pleased with myself.  Especially
considering I caught a squirrel on one of the mounds munching on
a snack of zucchini seeds a couple of days after I planted them.

There's also a couple of things coming up where I planted the
sunflower seeds.  I'm not sure if they're sunflowers, but they
were cute and hearty so I left them.

In other news, the latest thing the maple tree is flinging at
us is little green caterpillars.  Oh, and we have 
<a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/8284">golden dung
flies</a>, which are really pretty cool as bugs go, apart
from the obvious dung implication.  Stupid neighbour's dogs.
