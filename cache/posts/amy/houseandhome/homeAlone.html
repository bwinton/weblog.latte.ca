I am home alone.  I finished work last week and I'm now off on maternity
leave, or I will be as soon as the company I worked for gets the Record
of Employment forms I requested two weeks ago.  Delphine is still in
daycare, though; we are going to keep her in daycare even after the
baby comes because she likes it and it will provide her with some nice
stability and routine in what will otherwise be a bit of a shocking
time for her.

So for the first time in two years, I am not beholden to anyone.  I
don't have to structure my days around naps and meals and diapers and
activities, or work to someone else's list of things to do.  I feel
adrift and confused and a little guilty.

I have gotten a few things done today, and I have many many more things
to do, but I am procrastinating pretty badly as evidenced by the very
existence of this weblog entry.  Today I still need to empty and load the
dishwasher, put away the vegetables that were delivered, clean the
tub and the toilet, and take out the recycling.  I would also like to
hang a tapestry of my dad's that has been sitting at the back of a closet,
because now I have a really good spot for it in Delphine's room.

The good news is I am not due for another couple of weeks, so I have
lots of time to get things done.
