So.  We bought a house.  Yeah.
</p><p>
It's little.  It's dark.  It's a semi-detached and it is about four feet
away from the other neighbour, the one who isn't attached.  It hasn't
been renovated for twenty years; it is very much like a time capsule.
</p><p>
On the other hand, it has been impeccably maintained; the paint is 
perfect, the woodwork is flawless, and it's spotless.  It wasn't 
terribly much money (for the area) so we will have a little extra
to do urgent fix-ups (hello, dishwasher?)  It is on
an amazing street in a perfect neighbourhood in exactly the location
I wanted.  It has a 180-foot-deep lot so we have miles of backyard,
which means we can add additions and decks and patios on the
back and <em>still</em> have room for a garden and playhouse for the 
girls.  And a circus tent.  And a helicopter pad.  It has three
big bedrooms and a big kitchen.
