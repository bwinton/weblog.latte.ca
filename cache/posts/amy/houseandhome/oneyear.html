Today marks exactly one year since we moved into our little
house.  A year ago this evening we were sitting amid piles and
piles of boxes, still fretting from our run-in with surly
movers and our inability to locate toothbrushes or pyjamas
for the children.  Last Christmas was a cluttered mess with no
decorations except for a tiny pre-decorated tree.  
The months ahead would be full of frozen 
convenience food because our stove was unusable (although very
funky!), dim lighting, long walks to daycare, and the crustiest 
old linoleum I had
ever seen.  When I look back at it now I wonder how we 
possibly got through it, but at the time it seemed all right.
Kind of.

So after slogging through a long and unChristmassy December
in the new house, we interviewed a few contractors.  Mostly
they didn't seem to want to have anything to do with us, probably
because I got a list of recommendations from a friend of
contractors from the suburbs, and I bet they don't care to
bother with little houses with no driveway and tiny doors
and muddy access lanes when they can find a million suburban
clients with huge houses and lots of land to park their
dumpsters on.  But we finally found a guy who was really
nice and seemed helpful and smart, and seemed to understand
what we wanted, and who cost a billion
dollars.  We were very sad.  We looked at our reno plan
and started making cuts, and got into big fights; Blake
wanted to take down the walls and make do with the kitchen,
I thought I couldn't possibly make do with the kitchen and
the walls were aesthetic and could wait.  We cried.  Well,
I cried.  It sucked.

Then finally Andy made us meet with Stephanie and her
company, and they agreed to do the whole job for about half
the price the other dude was asking.  Half the price.  We had to make sure
they hadn't made a mistake about what we wanted, their price
was so low.  Well, the fact was they were doing a 
huge favour for Andy because he's such a swell guy; they
made us promise never to tell anyone else what they
charged us because they would go out of business if they
did any other jobs at that rate.  (It's good to have a
really charming father-in-law!)  So we didn't have to compromise.
We got it all: we took down the walls on the main floor,
we got a whole new kitchen, we tiled the front hall, 
we redid the electrical in the whole house and painted.
It all took only a couple of months, and to Stephanie
and her team's credit, they did everything to the 
exact same high standard that they set for their richer
clients, because they take personal pride in doing their
jobs properly.

In fact, just last week I discovered that
the trained monkeys who installed our Ikea  kitchen had
neglected to install the forced air vent.  They didn't just
forget, they actually saw that it should be done, didn't do
it, and willfully assembled the cabinetry so that the venting was 
very hard to install, because that was the easy thing for
them to do.  Cory had left a piece of venting there to 
show them where they would need to work around, and they 
took it out and tossed it aside, and then installed a
cabinet with the legs directly in front of the vent hole in 
the wall.  So last week when I realized there was no heat
in the kitchen, I emailed Stephanie.  She sent Cory in,
Cory arrived with his tools, assessed the situation, 
figured out a solution, implemented the solution, tidied
up and was out of there in a couple of hours.  No bill,
no invoice, nothing; it was considered part of the 
original reno, which is already paid for.

Stephanie has also sent members of her team back to repair
and paint cracks in the walls where the new drywall 
settled, to fix a sticky latch on a gate, and to clean
up some foam caulking stuff which someone had spilled
on the floor.  Stephanie believes in leaving a perfect
site, no matter how long it takes.

The reno wasn't a lot of fun to live through.  We set up
a makeshift kitchen (microwave, toaster oven and fridge)
next to the laundry sink in the basement and spent our days
there, in the tiny corner of the living room which was
cordoned off with a plastic sheet, and at Baba and Zaida's
house.  Oh, that sucked and it was a very long eight weeks
but it passed as inexorably as any other eight weeks, and 
one day it was over; appliances installed, plaster dust
vacuumed up, paint dried.  Suddenly we were normal people
with a normal (mostly) house.  What bliss!  What joy!
</p>
<p>
Now we have a house with lots of space on the main
floor (well... relatively speaking), a bright, sunny,
organized kitchen which gets a lot of use, tons of 
electrical outlets and lights, and a huge back deck.  I'm
really starting to like this house.  I did suffer a pang
of jealousy sitting in my friend's south-facing living
room.  We don't have any south-facing windows, and the
west windows are in the kitchen and Delphine's room, and
they're really pretty small.  So we don't get that ocean
of warm sunshine we used to get in the condo, and I miss
that on sunny winter days.  I hope that a couple of skylights
will make the house brighter.  One day.
</p>

A year ago today, cold, frustrated, tired, missing the condo
and wondering what the hell we had done, I consoled myself 
with the thought that in 
a year everything would be normal and happy again, and I was
right.  Yesterday we spent the whole day putting up our
(really rather huge, in this place) Christmas tree, spangling
the mantelpiece with tinsel and lights and tiny china Santas
(and a menorah, poor thing), and stringing J'Anne's beautiful
handmade stockings all up the staircase.  The house is warm
and cozy and full of love and giggling little girls, and I
could hardly be any happier.
