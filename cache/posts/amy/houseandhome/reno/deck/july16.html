clear="all"/> A bonus picture today!  The nice gentleman on the left
is Cory, our foreman/general contractor/construction guy.  (He insisted
on a re-do with the shades on.  I can get behind that.)  The picture
on the right is where we are as of now.  You can see sort of how far
it goes out (except that the board at the bottom of the picture is
about 5Â´ away from the door), and underneath the cat litter is a black
sheet of plastic, to kill whatever vegetation thinks it wants to grow
under there.</p>
