A Gate!  No longer just a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agate">pretty stone</a>, we now
have a gate to keep out whatever’s been pooing in our yard.  (Assuming
it isn’t one of the girls.  Or a raccoon.  Or someone’s cat.  Or
something that could squeeze through the gap in the bottom.  But
still, it’s got to be less likely to continue, right?)<br

Our garbage shed!  It’s a bit larger than I thought it would be which
I think is partially due to the sloped roof, which is mandatory in
places that get as much snow as we sometimes do, and partially
because…  Well, I don’t know why else it might be so big.  Maybe just
because that was the scale of the space it had to take up.  <br

And an old-new screen door.  This should get some air moving through
the house without my having to worry too much about finding a hornet
in my bed (again!)  And when the screen on the front gets installed,
it should be even sweeter.<br clear="all"/>
