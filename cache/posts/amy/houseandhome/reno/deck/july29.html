<p>Okay, I think the deck is officially done, and so it’s party time!
If you’re actually going to have a chance of making it here (sorry,
Dave), please <a href="/amy/houseandhome/reno/deck/july29.html">leave
a comment</a> or <a
href="mailto:bwinton@latte.ca?Subject=Available%20Party%20Dates.">email
me</a> with the dates that work well for you, and I’ll see what works
out the best for the most people.</p>

<p>The tricky part, I expect, will be restraining myself from writing
a program to figure out the optimal solution.</p>
