Well, it's four in the morning and I've been wide awake for at least
three-quarters of an hour.  I finally decided to stop lying in
bed thinking the same five thoughts over and over, and creep
down the world's creakiest stairs and make myself useful.
I don't think I will be sleeping again tonight, and I know
I'll regret it later this afternoon, but what can you do?
This must be what it's like to be Baba, or my brother Dave.

We are less than a week from the start of "demolition", a
rather grand name for clearing out the kitchen and taking 
down a couple of walls.  I suppose removing the little porch
from the back is pretty demolishy.  It all begins on Monday,
and in the intervening four days we need to clear as much
stuff as we can out of the main floor, and set up a makeshift
kitchen in the basement.  In the next month we are going to
become very familiar with what meals can and cannot be prepared
with a microwave, a toaster oven, a kettle and a crock pot.
I predict we will eat a lot of President's Choice frozen
meals.  And did you know they have microwave pizza?  Yeah...

The girls and I will also become very familiar with places
to hang out that are not home; Baba and Zaida's, the library,
the ROM, the park (if spring ever comes), Tanya's place, the
other library...  It's going to be a bit of a pain in the
ass, but I think the satisfaction of seeing the work progress
day after day will make up for it, unlike the changeless agony
of, say, trying to keep a condo clean and tidy while you're
selling it.
