We're one week into the reno, and the dust is flying.  The
electrical is almost done; we are replacing all the old
knob-and-tube wiring with the modern stuff, putting in
mostly new  light fixtures and light switches  in sensible
places, instead of three feet into the bedroom, or behind
the far door to the dining room, or just nowhere at all
in Delphine's room. (She had one of those bank-pen-chain
pull switches that she didn't have a hope of reaching for
another ten years.)
</p><p>
On the main floor, where most of the big changes are 
happening, the demolition is nearly complete.  They have taken
down all the walls except that between the kitchen and
the dining room, and that which defines the front hall
(and keeps the drafts out).  They've taken out the old
cabinet in the kitchen, the sink and its cabinet, and
the old gnarly linoleum tiles and subfloor.  They've cut and framed
a hole between the kitchen and the dining room, which
is going to be finished with some trim salvaged from 
the original arch between the dining room and the living
room.  The only demolition which remains to be done is
taking up the hardwood in the front hall (we are going
to put in vintage-style black and white mosaic tile 
instead).
</p><p>
Next week the inspector is coming in for the electrical,
and then they will patch the walls and start painting
upstairs.  They are going to move the plumbing for the 
sink, and put in the vent for the range hood, and lay
the new subfloor in the kitchen.  It's been fun watching
them tear the place apart, but I am really going to enjoy
watching them put it back together.

We haven't been able, to the shock of no-one, to salvage
and reuse as much as I originally thought we would.  I
said we would keep the cabinet in the kitchen but quickly
changed my mind when I realized how much I like runners on
my drawers, and base cabinets that don't go all the way
to the floor, and not having huge frames in the way of my
stuff, and maybe upper cabinets that are deep enough to 
store a dinner plate.  I got rid of the metal trim on
the counter because Jillian's right, it's a total pain
to keep clean.  I got rid of the stove because there's 
just no way to make an ancient electric stove into a
modern gas stove.  I got rid of the cabinet for the
sink because again, I wanted to get rid of the frames
and have more versatile cabinetry (we are putting a bunch
of drawers under the sink cabinet).
</p><p>
I haven't even kept many light fixtures; I kept the 
pretty fixtures in the girls' rooms, but almost all of
the others are gone, with the exception of a gorgeous
Nouveau fixture from the front hall which is too dim
to be useful but which we will reuse somewhere where
we don't need all that much light.

Ironically, we are ripping out a genuine vintage kitchen
and replacing it with a vintage-inspired kitchen.  Our
cabinets are going to be 
<a href="http://ths.gardenweb.com/forums/load/kitchbath/gal1212265932402.html?14">Applad White</a> which is flat-panel painted white,
very much like the original cabinet.  The floor is
going to be 
<a href="http://www.forbo.com/framework/ModuleFiles/mod_Product/Product/Image/994/3038.jpg">Marmoleum</a> in Caribbean, and the 
countertops will be 
<a href="http://www.formica.com/publish/site/na/us/en/index/laminate/colors_collections/classics.detail.6940.0001.html">Formica's Skylark
Boomerang</a>.  Oh, and the paint is Benjamin Moore's Standish
White, which almost exactly matches the floor.  
I am going to look for a vintage-style
wallpaper to do a focal point, and maybe a cute fabric for
a little curtain.  Three more weeks to go!
