<h3>Part II: Blake</h3>
<p>There's something slightly weird about me posting about
the other writer of this shared blog, but whatever.  This
is the wifely perspective on Blake's life.  </p>
<p>So Blake is in some kind of between-job limbo, fortunately
punctuated by contract work which we assume will be lucrative
once he gets paid.  There's a vague job offer in the offing
but nothing has been signed yet.  Limbo indeed.</p>
<p>The working from home is going pretty well, I think.
We don't have a home office, per se, in that our house
has six rooms (three bedrooms, bathroom, kitchen and 
living/dining) so he's set up in the bedroom, on 
Baba's antique sewing machine.  It's a pretty sad
 state of affairs and it wouldn't work in the long
term, but it will do for now.  He also takes breaks
in the living room, and sometimes gets out of the house
and works at U of T (where he Knows People) or Starbucks
(where he Spends Money).</p>
<p>Apart from the working he spends what seems to be
a lot of time on his own programming projects and on
open source projects.  (I say "what seems to be" because
for all I know he was spending the same amount of
time on that stuff when he was at the office and I
just didn't see it).  He also reads lots of books (but
not as many as me because he's not insane) and listens
to a lot of podcasts.  A huge number of podcasts.  Mostly
really geeky ones about programming languages, comics and
role-playing games.</p>
<p>Despite Blake being laid off in these Trying Times, we're pretty
optimistic.  Our spending habits are pretty sensible, and
the future looks bright.  And like Blake says, we have a lot
of available credit.  Hah.</p>
