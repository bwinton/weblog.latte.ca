<p>I've been thinking I should really take some driving lessons to
get over my fear of scary big city driving. Since I already have
a driver's license, I don't need actual in-class
lessons, I only need a few hours in one of those cars with the extra
set of brakes, so I emailed a couple of driving schools to see if I could
do that. Here is what I received in response from AllWheels Drivers:</p>
<blockquote>
were do you live and do you have ontario G1 licence.<br />
IF YOU ONLY HAVE SASK. licence you will have to get your G1 licence inder take driviong lessons.
</blockquote>

<p>I shit you not, I didn't change a single letter of that email.
If you're keeping track, that's three spelling errors, two missing
capital letters, one missing question mark, a whole lot of pointless
ALLCAPS, and one incomprehensible phrase ("inder take driviong lessons"?)</p>
<p>I was going to send a polite email explaining why this
isn't a good way to handle customer response, but it seems I can't
be bothered and would just rather blog about it here. I'm passive-aggressive
like that.</p>
<p>Since then I've received a recommendation for another driving school
from a friend. I won't be emailing them.</p>
