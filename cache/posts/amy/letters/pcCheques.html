<p>Here's a letter I sent to President's Choice Financial 
Mastercard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a PC Financial Mastercard and I'm very happy with 
it. However, I just ordered a set of convenience cheques 
and I was dismayed to see that you included a plastic 
chequebook holder. The environment is a major concern of 
mine and I don't believe it's necessary to include a 
plastic checkbook holder every time a client orders ten 
cheques. Ironically, the cheques came with a note telling 
me how environmentally friendly they are.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, I called the customer support 
number and the person I spoke to there ("Kevin") laughed 
at me when I expressed this concern. He said he would 
"put a note in my file". I asked if anyone would see 
it, and he replied that "someone might see it and have 
a chuckle". Perhaps he doesn't understand the gravity of 
climate change? Perhaps he doesn't care. But surely 
there is a better way to deal with a client's concerns 
than putting a note in their file so someone can 
stumble across it and have a chuckle.</p>
<p>Thanks for your attention to this matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, I read the fine print on the "convenience
cheques" and realized what a bum deal they are, so I'm 
going to go back to regular cheques anyway.</p>
