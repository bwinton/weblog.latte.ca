<p>Here's a letter I sent to Scholastic books through

<hr>
<p>Dear Mr. Robinson and Ms. Newman,</p>
<p>My name is Amy Brown.  My daughter is in kindergarten and she loves books.  I remember buying books through Scholastic when I was a kid - my copy of Charlotte's Web was a Scholastic book, and I just bought my daughter her own copy through Scholastic.  I think you provide a great service.</p>
<p>However, I am disappointed by the amount of toys, trinkets, and electronic media in your book clubs, to say nothing of the TV-show and movie tie-in books which are of questionable value.  It's really become a chore to comb through your catalogues in search of quality.  (Although it's much easier now that you list the author name - thanks for that!)</p>
<p>The opportunity to sell directly to children in schools is a privilege, not a right.  Schools grant Scholastic unique commercial access to children because of its reputation as an educational publisher.  But Scholastic is abusing that privilege by flooding classrooms across the country with ads for products and brands that have little educational value and compete with books for children's attention and families' limited resources.  There's no justification for marketing an M&amp;M videogame or lip gloss in elementary schools.  </p>
<p>Please return to selling books - and only books - through your in-school book clubs.</p>
<p>Sincerely,
Amy Brown</p>
