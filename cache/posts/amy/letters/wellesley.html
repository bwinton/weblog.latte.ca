<p>Sometimes I write letters about stuff that isn't very important
in the grand scheme of things.  I sent this to the nice folks
at <a href="http://www.wellappleproducts.com/">Wellesley</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just wanted to let you know how much I love your apple butter!
I am from rural Saskatchewan and some of my neighbours made
apple butter when I was a kid, so I was excited to see it on the
shelf at my grocery store.  I was even more excited when I
tasted it - I don't remember my neighbours' apple butter
being so sublime!  You have definitely figured out the
perfect recipe.</p>
<p>Wellesley Apple Butter is now my gift for people who are
visiting, or for when I go away -- maple syrup is such a
cliche, but apple butter is perfectly local and evocative of
Southern Ontario.  You make it easy to eat locally!</p>
<p>Congratulations!
Amy Brown</p>
