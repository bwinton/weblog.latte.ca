<p>I did another 3K in 2-and-1s this morning.  It was two 
degrees above, so mild I had to unzip
my jacket to cool off, and sunny!  I don't know
what we have done to earn this nice day, and on a weekend
to boot.  (This is an anomaly, though, this
afternoon it's going back to ball-freezing cold.  But at
least it's not January any more!)</p>
<p>It was a pretty rough run; two minutes seemed really long
and difficult.  I had a long day yesterday, though, and went to
bed late and was awoken at 2 am to find a lost sippy cup.
All these things make for harder runs.</p>
<p>Next week I'm going to forge ahead with 3.25 K in 
3-and-1s and see how it goes.  I realized this morning
that I've already screwed myself with my schedule: I 
was planning to run on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons,
but then I forgot and offered to help in Delphine's classroom on
Tuesdays.  So maybe I'll run on Tuesday evenings.  That
way I'd get one afternoon run, one evening run and one
morning run a week, which would provide some welcome 
variety.</p>
<p>Also I'm not going to blog every single run.  It's just
not that interesting.  I'll try and check in every week,
to keep me honest.</p>
