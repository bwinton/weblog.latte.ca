<p>Kat has inspired me to get my running shoes back on; she is
training for an as-yet-unspecified 5K, so we're going to 
egg each other on.  She runs on the treadmill at her condo
and I like to run outside (because I don't have a treadmill
and I'm too poor to join a gym, and because running on
a treadmill is boring) so we probably won't actually 
run together until spring.  But we'll talk about running!</p>
<p>We talked about running last night before choir, and as Kat
wisely pointed out, if you want to do something you should
do it as soon as possible after you've determined to do it,
so I ran this afternoon after I dropped Delphine off at
school.  Since Blake is "working" from "home", he can 
make sure Cordelia doesn't catch fire or something 
while she's napping, and so I can leave the house in the 
afternoon.  Plus it was sunny and warm (only -5!) - too
good to pass up.</p>
<p>I did 3K in 1-and-1s.  1-and-1s is pretty lame, but I
haven't been out for a long time, and it's cold and 
when I run in the cold my lungs get wheezy and I get 
that coppery taste in my mouth, so
I thought I would go easy on myself.  And it was a
pretty easy run.  There were times
when the one minute of running seemed too short, and
only one time when I was really glad of the break, so
next time I will do 2-and-1s.  </p>
<p>My plan is to run three times a week, on Tuesdays,
Thursdays and the weekend.  I'll do 3K for the next two
runs and then up the distance a little bit and also
increase intensity to 3-and-1s.  I just hope it doesn't
stay so cold for weeks and weeks.  I don't know if I
can motivate myself to run when it's horribly cold.</p>
<p>I went for a couple of runs over the winter, before
it got so cold.  I tried something new: listening to
music instead of timing my intervals.  (I have to
choose because I time intervals by the beeping of
my watch and if I'm listening to music I can't hear
the beeps.  I'm sure there is some technological 
solution to this problem.)  Listening to music is
fun, but I missed the satisfaction of being able 
to measure and manage the ratio of running to walking.
(I'm a geek.)  Plus it's kind of nice to have time
to just let the thoughts roll through my head.  Apparently
that kind of unstructured daydreaming time is <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026811.500-the-secret-life-of-the-brain.html">very
important</a>.  So I'm going to stick with timing
intervals.</p>
<p>And now I should go stretch.</p>
