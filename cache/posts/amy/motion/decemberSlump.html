Today I ran for the first time in a month and a half.
I  signed up for the Resolution Run 5K on December
31 in an attempt to motivate myself to keep running
through the winter, but I didn't count on the move
joining forces with the cold weather to put me off
lacing up my sneakers.
</p><p>
So between cleaning and packing and moving and
unpacking and being busy and exhausted, I haven't
been running.  It seems there are things I give 
up on when I am very busy, and things I don't;
the things I give up on are exercise, reading,
baking and cooking complicated meals.  The things
I don't give up on are watching TV, sleeping,
flossing, going to choir practice and seeing 
friends.  And eating &mdash; I hear there are
people who get so busy they forget to eat, but
that's never been an issue for me.

I did, finally, go for a run today.  After the
collosal binge that is Christmas Day I was 
desperate to do something healthy, and I thought
I should test the waters to see how well I can 
expect to do at the Resolution Run on the 31st.
I did 2K today, and I didn't die; I made it through
the first ten minutes okay, although I started too
fast and almost wore myself out.  I had to take a
walk break in the second ten minutes, but only for 
half a block.  I think I should be fine in the
Run if I do five and ones or seven and ones.
</p><p>
Now that we are getting settled in and it's no
longer imperative to spend every spare moment
unpacking, I am going to try and go out for two 
2Ks and one 5K every week.
