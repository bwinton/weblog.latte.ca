<p>Since my last run on Tuesday the weather has taken
a turn for the snowier.  We got 15 or 20 cm of snow
yesterday.  Most people have shovelled, but today's
run was more adventuresome than usual as I tried to
figure out how to get over and through all the slush.</p>
<p>I did 3K in 2-and-1s.  There were a couple of times 
I was really glad to get that walking break, and one
time in a very snowy block I just ignored the
"start running" beep and took an extra few seconds
of walking, but otherwise it was a good run.  It
was -8Â°C,  but I was warm enough in my usual gear,
until I stopped to chat with a neighbour at the end.</p>
<p>Now I've gone and woken up Cordelia.  Hopefully she
will go back to sleep because I still want to have
my afternoon reading break, and I have to stretch, and
empty and load the dishwasher.  And do laundry.  God my 
life is lame sometimes.</p>
