I went running last night with my friend Michelle, my real-life
inspiration for all this perspiration.  It was the first time I
have been running with someone else, apart from the clinic.  It
was easier than running alone; the time goes a little faster.
We chatted about this and that and she gave me some hard won
running tips.  (Breathing is good!)    She is training for a
half-marathon which means she runs for, like, multiple hours
at a time, and is doing hill training and real athletic things
like that.  That's so cool!

Since I was running with company (company, moreover, with a
fancy interval-timing watch) I decided to try three-and-ones 
for the first time.  The first set was fairly hard but we
slowed down a little and the rest were quite doable, if a
smidgen on the long side.

Running with someone was fun, but running alone is nice, 
too &mdash; it's good to have some
time alone with myself.  I think it will be less pleasant as I
increase my running time; I imagine it will be harder work and I
will find it more difficult to keep my mind off the pain, or
maybe the boredom.  Perhaps that is when I will treat myself to
an iPod.

I'm back in a Learn To Run clinic again; last Saturday was
the first meeting.  Obviously, since I attended the first two
weeks of the last clinic before my injured knee forced me to
drop out, it was all familiar material.  The run portion was
a cakewalk for me since it was two minutes walking, one minute
running, although we were running a little faster than I have
been.  I hit it off with another girl and we ran quite far behind
everyone else.  She was embarrassed but I didn't care; better to
run slow and keep running than to run fast, save face, and hurt
yourself.
