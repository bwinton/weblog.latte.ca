So yeah, running.  I haven't been.  For a while there we 
were in a crazy deep freeze the likes of which I moved out of
the prairies to avoid, and then I hurt my back, and... oh,
I don't know, there's always something that comes up.  
Dishes!  Dishes are the last straw for me, it seems; I can
manage to do the housekeeping and look after the kids and
go to choir and run and read and stuff when I have a dishwasher,
but when I have to do dishes by hand it all goes to hell.  How
do we generate so many dirty dishes?

I did do a tortuous and pathetic 3K last weekend, which is
better than the nothing I have done since.

But I think I'm okay with a winter lull.  I would like, ideally,
to run through December, just to counteract the holiday madness
both psychologically and healthwise, but I don't think I would
be too devastated if I took a break from running every January
and February.  It's hibernation time.  That's long enough, though.
Once March comes I will set a schedule and work towards running
5K straight through without a walking break.
