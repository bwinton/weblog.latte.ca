<p>Yesterday Canada elected a Conservative majority government. Our 
House of Commons has 308 seats, and the Conservatives won 167 of
then with 40% of the popular vote. The NDP is our new official
opposition with 102 seats and 31% of the popular vote. The Liberals,
Canada's "natural governing party", suffered a huge setback winning
only 34 seats and 19% of the popular vote.</p>
<p>My politics lie somewhere around the NDP/Greens, but I'm not partisan.
If there was a party that ran on a platform of evidence-based
compassionate pragmatism I would vote for it, but there isn't so I do
the best I can. This time I voted for Carolyn Bennett, our incumbent Liberal
candidate, because she's clever and effective. It wasn't a difficult
choice, because I would have been happy to have Michael Ignatieff as
Prime Minister.</p>
<p>I'm not happy about this result; I'm pretty miserable, actually. Stephen
Harper's faults are well-documented elsewhere, so I won't go into that.
I'm not on-board with the Conservative platform, obviously, and I worry that
with a majority they will make changes to this country that lead it further and
further away from what I value.</p>
<p>I'm also frustrated with our electoral system. Electoral reform
makes my head spin but I understand enough to know that our system is broken
and our government doesn't accurately represent us. Dave Meslin can
<a href="http://meslin.wordpress.com/2011/05/02/beyond_band-aids/">
explain it</a> better than I can.</p>
<p>So the question remains: As a citizen, what do I do next? </p>
<p>There's a school of thought that says that everything will work out and nothing
will go horribly wrong no matter who is in government. I think this is the
school of thought that non-voters follow, because if that's true, why vote?:
stuff will work itself out, everything will be fine.</p>
<p>If I followed that school of thought I would just carry on exactly as I
have been. Of course if I followed that school of thought I wouldn't have
been so upset last night when the results came in. In fact, I probably
wouldn't even have watched.</p>
<p>There's another school of thought the members of which are rending their
garments today: the CBC is going to be dismantled, abortion and gay marriage
outlawed, gun control repealed, mega-jails built on every corner. That school
is well-represented in my Twitter feed, but it's not one I subscribe to either.
I'm not sure what would prevent the Harper government from doing all that:
perhaps they mostly don't really want to, perhaps they fear that the electorate
would disapprove and not re-elect them, perhaps there are checks and balances
in place that would otherwise stimie them.  But I don't believe a Conservative
majority equals the Hellmouth opening.</p>
<p>If I followed that school of thought... well, I don't know what those people
are doing. Drinking, I guess.</p>
<p>This is what I think. I think things don't just work out fine by themselves. I
think they work out because of the hard work of thousands of people writing
letters and articles, rallying support (or just plain rallying), raising money,
going on TV, and doing all the other things besides voting that democracy
entails. </p>
<p>And so I'm going to email Carolyn Bennett's office and see what I can do
to help. Help immigrants, help families, help seniors. Help make (keep) this
country great.</p>
