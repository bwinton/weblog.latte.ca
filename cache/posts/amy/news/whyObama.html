<p>Last night a friend asked me why I was excited that
Barack Obama won the American election.  Why, as
a Canadian, do I care?  I couldn't really begin to
explain in a Twitter post, and I was tired, but
I thought about it as I went to sleep and here is
what I have come up with.</p>
<p>I like Americans.  I know lots of them and I like most
of the Americans I know, and for a long time I have been
perplexed by the apparent gulf between "America" and 
the American people I know.  Last night's victory 
closed that gulf; it seems America the country is
a lot more closely aligned to the beliefs and hopes
of the America I know than to the vocal minority of
fundamentalist and fear-mongers we have heard from
of late.  And thank goodness for that.  So I am very
happy for my American friends, that finally their
government reflects them.</p>
<p>I like what this victory says about America.  I have
a friend who was predicting a McCain win: "The young
people won't wait in line to vote", he said.  "The 
early results with show a strong lead for Obama and
everyone else won't bother to vote", he said.  There
was an argument put forth that Americans <em>say</em> to
pollsters that they would vote for an African-American,
but then in the privacy of the polling booth their
secret inner racist comes out.  I am glad those
arguments were wrong.  I am glad America got excited
about its future and came out to vote in droves,
many for the first time, many waiting in line 
(or on line) for hours.</p>
<p>Why am I glad?  Because Americans are people, and
people are the same everywhere, and if Americans 
can get excited about democracy and step up and do
the right thing, it makes me feel better about people
everywhere.</p>
<p>I'm glad Barack Obama won because he ran an honourable
and decent campaign.  Everyone pisses and moans about
negative campaigning, mud-slinging and pettiness, but
it seemed, until now, inevitable, like the weather.
Obama has proved it's possible to win an election
with a positive, optimistic campaign.  (Okay,
maybe rather vague, but vague in a positive way.)
While McCain and Palin were screechin' and spittin',
fear-mongerin' and fist-shakin', Obama maintained his composure 
without condescending.  This is a great lesson for
American politicians and a great lesson for politicians
everywhere in the world.  The bar has been raised.</p>
<p>Obama is smart.  Really smart, and America is crying
out for a smart person in the White House.  Why
does this matter to me as a Canadian?  Because I
am excited to have someone in office who has a hope
of understanding and acting on 
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2008/11/how-green-will-president-obama.html?DCMP=ILC-arttsrhcol&amp;nsref=specrt12_head_Green%20White%20House">climate change</a>, a global issue if ever there
was one.  Where America leads, the world follows
and we desperately need someone to lead us in the
right direction on this matter.  (Apparently Canada
isn't going to do it.)</p>
<p>It's not just climate change.  The world faces
numerous potential global threats: a flu pandemic,
a disaster in our fragile food distribution system,
terrorism, peak oil.  Not to mention whatever the hell
is going on with the economy.  It's fine, I guess, to have
a numbskull in office when there's not much to do,
but when anything could happen I am much happier 
knowing that there is someone in the most powerful
position in the world who has a hope of really understanding
the situation, consulting with the right people and making
an informed decision without resorting to dogma and
superstition.</p>
<p>And I'll admit it: I got caught up in the excitement of
the moment.  (I still am; I am dying to sit down and
watch the Stewart/Colbert special from last night!)
Obama is the "other" to so many Americans: he is
black to white Americans, he is educated to uneducated
Americans, he is foreign-raised to Americans who have never
left the country, he is the son of an African to 
slave-descended Americans
(although I never heard anyone talk about that), he
is the son of an atheist and a lapsed Muslim to
Christian Americans, he
is erudite and witty and Northern and liberal(ish); he
is so many things that we have heard that Americans
aren't (Real Americans, that is) and yet America voted
for him.  That so many people were able to see past
the things they don't share with Barack Obama
and see in him the best of their common humanity
stirs in me great pride and hope
for what has been and could again be a great nation.</p>

<p>I don't know if Barack Obama is going to be as shiny as his
most enthusiastic supporters make him out to be.  I don't know if any
mortal could be.  But I am excited about what this
election says about America and I am optimistic
about the future.  Why not be?</p>
