<p>I looked and looked for some cool gifts for Blake's birthday,
and largely failed. (I ended up getting him a couple of books 
and some chocolate, always welcome around here.)  However, I
did find a whole heap of stuff I want!  (This is the problem
with shopping, and why I don't do it as a rule.)</p>
<p>Here is my <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cotr46">Lee Valley wish list</a>.
Some glue to fix my wobbly chairs; some flashlights in case of
a blackout (extras so the girls can lose a couple); some
heavy-duty magnets to hold those giant construction paper
projects to the fridge; a solar-powered radio (see above
re: blackout); a sharpener which may or may not wreck my
knives; a completely gratuitous gingerbread house mold I may
never use but which represents the kind of Christmas Mom I
would like to be; and of course the aforementioned mandoline.
Nothing really cool for Blake though.</p>
<p>Then I checked <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">ThinkGeek</a>. They
have lots of cool stuff that Blake <em>might</em> like, but we have
a small house and stuff has to be really awesome to earn a 
place in here, and I just wasn't sure he would like any of
the stuff enough.  But I found 
<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/brain/gimme.cgi?wid=81d9c4027">some stuff I like</a>:
an MP3 player for the girls; an awesome keyboard (with clicky
keys!); a gratuitous but cool alarm clock; more fridge magnets;
another emergency radio; a clock to help the girls learn how
to tell time (whilst also not being criminally ugly!); and a
thing to tell us how much power we're wasting with our three
computers and my stubborn refusal to light my home with greenish-grey
fluorescent lights.</p>
