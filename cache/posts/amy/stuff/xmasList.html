<p>No-one is actually going to get me any of this stuff, because
we don't do presents for grown-ups, but that hasn't stopped
me from accumulating a list of material desires.</p>
<p><strong>Cool skullcandy earphones</strong>. I have these lame over-the-head
earbud-ish earphones which always fall out of my ears, and I'm
pretty sure most of the sound goes somewhere other than into my
head. I'm torn between <a href="http://www.skullcandy.com/shop/lowrider-blue-white.html">big fat earphones</a> so everyone
can tell I'm listening to music (and not to them fighting, say),
or <a href="http://www.skullcandy.com/shop/smokin-bud-pink.html">little wee earbuds</a> that I can stash in my purse.
Only if they come with a little wind-ey holder for the wire,
though. I get so tired of unwinding headphone wires.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://store.demitassejewelry.com/thefreddy.aspx">Freddie 
Demistache</a></strong>. I love moustaches, I love 
Freddie. I love jewellery. I think this is brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>Starbucks Takeout Mug, Tall Size</strong>. Blake has his giant Venti
mug which he brings every time we go to Starbucks, and I feel
left out.</p>
<p><strong>Oui by Lancome perfume</strong>. I haven't worn perfume since Delphine
was born and I miss it.</p>
<p><strong>A waffle iron</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>What Not To Wear</em></strong> <strong>on DVD</strong>. I know, it seems like an
odd show to buy, but ever since we cancelled cable I haven't
been able to watch it&mdash;it's not downloadable anywhere.
(The problem with downloading shows is that the less geeky they
are, the less likely anyone has uploaded them.) Anyway, I miss
Stacy and Clinton and all their advice and ideas.</p>
