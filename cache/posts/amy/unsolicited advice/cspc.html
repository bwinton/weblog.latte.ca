It's not a bad idea to go to the 
<a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpsclist.asp">CSPC</a> website and sign
up for their email notifications of product recalls.  Right now I
am obsessively staring at the page about  bracelets that came 
free with Reebok sneakers.  They have high lead content and a
four-year-old girl died from swallowing part of one.  I mean,
can you fucking <em>imagine</em>?

Incidentally there are lots of recalls for cheap dollar-store
and vending machine jewellery containing lead.  I think we will
have a "no cheap tacky-ass jewellery" rule in this house.

If you are, perchance, looking for a hydrocortisone preparation,
perhaps for a rash which has mysteriously appeared on your
oldest daughter's hand, and you should happen to notice that
of the three preparations available, "cream", "ointment" and
"lotion", the lotion seems to be the best deal, you should 
know that said lotion is in fact largely composed of isopropyl
alcohol.  Whoever thought it was a good idea to sell ALCOHOL
to put on RASHES deserves some kind of Stupid award, which they
can share with me for buying it without reading the ingredients
list.  I am going to see if I can return it for a refund tomorrow.
