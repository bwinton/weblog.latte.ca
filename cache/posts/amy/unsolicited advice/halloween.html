<p>Our school website contains a list of handy Hallowe'en
safety tips, among them the old chestnut about
inspecting kids' candy before they eat it.  I suppose that wouldn't 
hurt, but it might be interesting to know that there
has never been a case of random poisoned 
Hallowe'en candy.  There have been a few
reports of candy with pins, and apples with
razors, but the vast majority of those were hoaxes
or pranks.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of links from the valuable 
Snopes website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.snopes.com/horrors/poison/halloween.asp">On poisoning</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.snopes.com/horrors/mayhem/needles.asp">On needles and razors</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps it seems harmless to continue repeating
these needless warnings, but I think it breeds 
cynicism and fear, which we have far too 
much of.  (Don't even get me started on "Stranger
Danger".)</p>
<p>(I'm going to have to think further about the appropriateness
of cynicism and/or fear with respect to Chinese
candy.)</p>
