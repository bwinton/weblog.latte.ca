First I want to say that the idea of this unsolicited 
advice is to publish things that I have learned through
my own experience that I did not read about elsewhere,
in books or in magazines, or that I read so many 
conflicting recommendations about that I might as well
have not read any.  I'm trying to avoid all the really
obvious stuff, or the stuff which is widely published.
But what I've learned is that all babies are
different, and what worked for me might not work for 
you, so take this for what it is; advice born from the
experience of one (well-read, intelligent) mother of
two (really easy) children.

<strong>Diaper cream</strong> is one of those things which
everyone has a different recommendation for, which leads
me to believe that different things work for different
babies.  All I have to say here is that diaper creams
which contain fish oil will make your baby smell like
a salmon cannery, and if you use cloth diapers they will
continue to smell fishy even after laundering.  Read 
labels carefully, and try all the other kinds of diaper 
cream first.
</p><p>
Okay, one more thing.  Johnsons 3-in-1 Diaper Cream and
Aveeno Diaper Cream have exactly the same ingedients and
are made by the same company, so buy the one that's on
sale.

<p><strong>Bathing</strong> babies is something that I have
never quite figured out.  They're too big for the kitchen
sink (assuming your kitchen sink is clean enough anyway)
and too small for the tub, and I can't stomach spending
money on one of those in-bath baby holders (which Health 
Canada advises against anyway).  They're slippery as 
hell, they hate being bathed, and how dirty does a baby
get anyway?  I resolved the problem by just not
bathing my babies very often, until they're old enough
to sit up and manage the whole process more-or-less 
by themselves, as Delphine is.  And she still only gets
a bath twice a week.  Who has time for more?

This is probably too late for the unindentified target
for this advice, but perhaps not for you:  get yourself
a <a href="http://www.babytrekker.com/">BabyTrekker</a>.
They are so much better than the other comparable 
products I don't even want to go into it.  They are
way more comfortable, distribute the weight of the baby
much more sensibly over your body, and they carry up
to 40 lbs, which is considerably more than Delphine 
weighs at almost three years of age.  (I don't let her
go in the Trekker any more because I think it looks
silly.  I am so mean.)  Plus you can use them as a front
or backpack.  I love my Trekker.  I just wish they
had come out with the Tasteful Taupe model when we bought
ours; we have Fugly Forest Green.

You're going to need to get yourself a <strong>5 ml
medication syringe</strong>. Lots of medications for 
babies come with 1 mL rubber bulb syringes, which not 
only make it hard to get the right dosage into the syringe
(and then into the baby),
but are often too small to contain the whole dose at
once.  For example, I needed to give Cordelia some 
Tempra, which comes with a 1 mL bulb dispenser, but
I needed to give her 1.25 mL.  That means I have to
go through the measuring part twice, AND the horribly
traumatic squeezing it into the unwilling child's mouth
part twice.  She's no slouch, and once she's learned that
the syringe means foul pink unction, the next part of the
dose is going to end up in her ear.
</p><p>
The good news is that some medications come with the
good kind of syringe (I think Tylenol is one of them)
so don't throw that out after the medication is done,
keep it in your first aid kit.

Something more metaphysical to end (because Cordelia's
awake now).  I had trouble, with Delphine, understanding
that she is just a baby for a little while.  Intellectually,
of course, I understand that she's going to grow up, but
in some more primitive part of my brain it seemed that
every day of not enough sleep, too many diapers and no
time to do housework, let alone read, was just the first
day of thousands more of the same.  I guess, having never
watched a baby grow up before, I didn't really believe it would
happen.  And it makes sense; any changes in my life until
now I have effected through my own labour: I took a course,
or looked for a new job, or bought a new condo, or whatever.
I'm not used to standing by and watching my life change
outside of my own volition.
</p><p>
It's much easier with Cordelia.  When I have a horrible
day when all she wants is to be held all day, and I have
laundry and vacuuming and cooking to do and nothing is
getting done, I know that this is just temporary, that
eventually she will be able to walk and talk and play
by herself, and she won't need me every single minute.
That makes it much easier.
</p><p>
Incidentally, it seems this is a hard lesson to learn;
I still have moments which I think the Delphine is going
to be a whiny, needy, contrary toddler forever, even
though I know, logically, that one day she will be a 
pleasant and helpful three-year-old.  I just can't
see how it will happen, because I haven't seen it 
happen before.
