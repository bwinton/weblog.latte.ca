<p>About six years ago I received in the mail a small tub of
NeoStrata AHA cream with 10% glycolic acid.  It was
sent to me by a friend who had tried it to cure her 
acne with no success.  To my surprise, shortly after I
started using it, my skin cleared up.  The clogged pores
that made my forehead into a shiny billboard of braille nonsense
disappeared, along with the pimples which had been with me
since high school.  I never had terrible acne, but I always
had one or two or three pimples on the go at a time, and
I always made it worse by picking.  Pick pick pick.</p>
<p>But once I started using the new cream, for the first 
time in my adult life I had clear, 
smooth almost-alabaster skin.  It's a small thing and
I feel like I shouldn't be so vain about it, but it was 
nice to walk around and not be self-conscious about
my skin.  Before the acne went away I thought I would
feel prettier if I didn't have these spots, and
as it turns out, I was right.  I felt prettier and 
more confident.</p>
<p>So every time I ran out of the glycolic acid cream I
went for a few days without it, just to make sure that
I wasn't wasting my money, and sure enough within a
couple of days the clogged pores would pop up on my
forehead, a sure harbinger, I thought, of the pimples
to come.  So off to the store I would go to spend another
$35 on the magic cream.</p>
<p>But now the pimples are back, just like before.  I have
a scar on my chin where I picked one last week, I have
a scab on my forehead and another at my hairline, and
I have a new pimple brewing on the other side of my
chin.  <em>Exactly</em> the same as before: same kind of pimples,
same places.  My skin is doing the time warp.  I actually
wore makeup the other day.  I never wear makeup!</p>
<p>So what changed, I asked myself.  I am using exactly the
same beauty routine as I was three months ago: plain soap
and the glycolic acid stuff.  What changed?</p>
<p>Then I realized: Cordelia stopped nursing.  Yeah.  I 
started using the glycolic acid cream when I was a few
months pregnant.  Then I had Delphine, then I nursed her,
then I got pregnant with Cordelia (without giving up 
nursing), had her and nursed her, until a couple of months
ago.  And then the acne came back.  But not the clogged
pores!  Apparently the cream cured them but wasn't 
actually having an effect on the acne.</p>
<p>It's almost funny (haw haw) how much time and money
and grief I spent between the ages of thirteen and
twenty-seven, trying to get rid of these pimples.  All I 
needed to do was get knocked up!  Ha!</p>
<p>So next time I go see the doctor I will ask her about
trying one of those birth control pills which cure
acne as a "side effect".  Since pregnancy cured it, 
perhaps something which feigns pregnancy will have
the same effect!  We'll see.  In the meantime I will
try and stop picking.</p>
