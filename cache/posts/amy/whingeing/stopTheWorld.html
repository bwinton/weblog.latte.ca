<p>Life is coming at me too fast lately. </p>
<p>We're still in the middle of the
bathroom reno (basement powder room is done, upstairs bathroom is 
entirely non-functional).  This means I have to find somewhere else to 
shower.</p>
<p>I just helped publish a <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/">book</a>, which is
really cool but the work keeps coming; we have a print edition, but we also
want to produce various different eBooks (and the giant learning curve that
entails), not to mention fixing errata and keeping the website up to date.</p>
<p>The girls' school spring fair is this weekend, which means I will be
baking for the bake sale tomorrow, and both Blake and I are volunteering
on the day of.</p>
<p>Delphine has had a persistent infestation of lice, for almost two weeks.  We've
treated with the chemical agent and picked nits for hours, but that didn't do
the trick so I treated her again today with some herbal stuff of dubious value
and spent another hour or so picking nits.</p>
<p>My brother is getting married in July, which is going to be completely
awesome, but I've never been to Japan before and I have a ton of things
to do, get, and read about before I go.</p>
<p>Then there's the usual groceries, laundry, cooking, picking up and
dropping off, vacuuming, etc, etc.</p>
<p>And, finally, inevitably, I just scratched my head and came away with a live
louse.  So now I'm off to shave my head. Or something.</p>
