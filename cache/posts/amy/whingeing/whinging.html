Pronounced "windjing", it means "complaining persistently and in a 
peevish or irritating way".  Since so much of my blogging (and indeed
most people's) is devoted to general or specific pissing and moaning,
I thought I'd better give it its own category.  Not so much to elevate
the whiny posts, but to segregate them from the rest of the weblog,
the parts which might give you the impression that I'm a normal
well-adjusted person and not a neurotic whining freak.

I had a teeny tiny breakdown this morning.  It started yesterday;
I was reading a book and one of the characters was talking about
lying awake all night with insomnia.  Luckily I have never had
trouble sleeping, because the very thought of trying to deal with
the children and get through a day without any sleep (or even without
the seven hours which I absolutely need) got me into a bit of a
panic.  Then I got to thinking about how one person raising a
family, alone for most of the day, is completely abnormal from a
biological point of view.  Humans are pack animals, we are supposed
to live in extended family groups.  I should have grannies and
aunties and big sisters and cousins around to help me with my
kids while I help with theirs.  I shouldn't have to pull Cordelia
out of her nap every single day to pick Delphine up from school,
or drag Delphine away from her activities so we can get Cordelia
from her school.

So there was all that, and on top of it the children are fighting
like ferrets in a sack all the time, or at least it seems like it,
and furthermore Delphine has started to explore the exciting world
of misbehaviour and deception — and I'm feeling singularly unqualified
to deal with that — and I have a cough and a sinus infection
and it's bloody cold outside — I am so sick of winter — and I'm tired 
and all I want to do is 
sit on the couch eating brownies and watching Jack Harkness kiss 
people, which isn't going
to happen until I have dragged my carcass through another sorry day
of this madness.  The nice thing about working in an office is that
you can phone it in for a day, or a week, or even a month or two and
no-one seems to notice, but as a Mom you have to step up and cook and
clean and pick up and drop off every single bloody blessed day with
no reprieve.  Well, except after bedtime.  Thank god for bedtime.
And thank god my kids are as good as they are, because as Blake's
mother says, "You think this is bad, you should see regular children!"

And that has been the whinge for today.  Thank you very much.
