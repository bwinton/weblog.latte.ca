Amy and I bought some new art this afternoon.  I had recently
seen a <a href="http://www.postershop.com/Ullman-Gayle-p.html"
>poster</a> that I thought she would like, and so when we went by
the store, we dropped in.  It turned out there was another in the
same series, and we agreed that they would look pretty good above
the computer.  So we got them, and hung them, and I put a <a

up.  The other picture is of a banana bread Amy made a while ago.
