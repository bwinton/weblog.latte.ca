I took a few more <a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/2003-01-25/"
>pictures</a> last weekend, and finally got the time to put them up on
the web.  Nothing too exciting, I don't think, but they turned out
reasonably well.  When I convert them to their final web-based format
I scale them down so that they're smaller than 800x700.  If that's
still too large, or too slow, <a href="mailto:bwinton@latte.ca">let me
know</a>, and I'll see about cutting it back further.  When I'm using
my laptop (which runs at 1024x768 (Shut up, you!)) I get about 15
pixels worth of scrollbar, but I don't know if that's because of my
overly large IE title settings, or if the pictures are actually too
large.
