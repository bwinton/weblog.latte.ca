<p>So my role at the company is changing slightly.  Due to a manpower
shortage, I'll be back doing some server development.  Fortunately, I
sort of know my way around the modules this time, and so I don't
expect many surprises to crop up.  So, to make my life both simpler
and more difficult at the same time, I've decided to try out a new
IDE.  That's right, instead of using IDEA, I'll be giving Eclipse a
trial run.  It hasn't been too bad so far, but I'm still kind of
getting it set up to do the things I need it to.</p>

<p>My three main motivations for using Eclipse on this project are:
<ol>
  <li>I need to look at C++ code at the same time as Java code, since
      that's the only documentation we have for this project.</li>
  <li>The savings of an IDEA license are not inconsiderable.</li>
  <li>The co-worker who is working on it with me prefers Eclipse</li>
</ol>
Are they great reasons to switch?  Maybe, maybe not, but they're good
enough reasons to give it a try for a while.  It helps that I have
been using an older version of Eclipse for my Python development, so
I'm a little familiar with it.</p>
