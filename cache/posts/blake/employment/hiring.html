<p>While I'm here posting up a storm, I should mention that <a
href="http://www.phantomfiber.com">my company</a> could really use
some good Java and C++ people, hopefully senior enough to be team
leads on some upcoming projects, but I hear that we could use people
of any and all skill levels.  Well, perhaps not the most junior,
unless they're really smart, and self-starters.  If you are looking
for a job, or know anyone who is, please <a
href="http://www.phantomfiber.com/careers.htm">contact us</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you wanted to know what it was like working here, feel free
to <a href="mailto:blake@phantomfiber.com">email me</a>.</p>
