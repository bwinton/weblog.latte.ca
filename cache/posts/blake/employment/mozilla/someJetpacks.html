<p>There have been a couple of things I’ve noticed myself doing over and over
again recently, and because I’m a developer whenever I do something over
and over again, I try to find a way to automate it.</p>
<p>So I did some playing around with Mozilla’s <a href="https://builder.mozillalabs.com/">Add-on Builder</a> and came up with <a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/Work/jetpacks/">a couple of Jetpacks</a> that solved my problems.  Maybe
you’ll find them useful, too.</p>
