<p>So <a href="http://www.phantomfiber.com">the company I work
for</a> has just released our <a
href="http://www.covers.com/covers/mobile/mobile.asp">first
product</a>.  It took a lot of time and effort to get there, but
I think we did something good.  The main part I've been working
on these past few weeks was the "synchronized (offline) mode!"
part.  There are a lot of challenges to writing a Conduit for the
Palm Desktop, some of which come from our framework.  It was
really designed to be used in an application, with Models, and
Views, and asynchronous network calls.  I'm trying to use it in a
dll with no UI, no application, and synchronous messages.  It's a
bit of a mis-fit, but it mostly works.
