<p>Ah, kindergarten.  After dropping Delphine off, I went to
Starbucks, grabbed myself a latte, and sat and started to read my
book.  Sadly, the presence of two wasps flying past my head sort of
ruined my quite interlude, and I headed on home.  When I was here, I
managed to check my email, increment the laundry (you all use that
term too, right?  When you put the stuff from the dryer into the
basket, the stuff from the washer into the dryer, and stuff from the
dirty hamper into the washer), and hang the wet load out in the
backyard.  Yeah, apparently when Amy isn’t home I get all domestic.
Who’lda thunk it?</p>

<p>But even given that, I really seem to have less free time than I
thought I would.  Somehow, between checking email and the various
household chores, I haven’t been able to read as much of my book as I
would have wanted, much less write the specs/code that I was hoping
to.  Ah well, perhaps I’ll get used to the routine by Friday, or maybe
I’ll just put those tasks on pause until I get back to work.</p>
