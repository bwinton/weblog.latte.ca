<p>Yeah, today is coming together much better than yesterday did.  I
just skipped the Starbucks, and came home from kindergarten, stopping
off at Valumart to pick up a couple of pie shells.  Oh, yeah, this
morning, Delphine and I made an apple cake, but our <a

>bundt pan</a> wasn’t nearly large enough, so we were left with a ton
of apple filling.  I threw it into a (store-bought, shhh!) pie shell,
cut the other shell into strips, and made a nice lattice on top, and
I’m now baking it at 350º for 25 minutes.  (I totally guessed at the
time and temperature.  I suppose I should go look it up in Betty
Crocker, huh?  Damn, did I ever mess that one up!  Betty says 425º for
40-50 minutes, with foil around the edges and stuff.  Good thing I
checked.)  Easy-peasy (even with the foil).</p>

<p>Anyways, I think I’m going to end this entry now, and go sit on the
couch and read my book.  <span style="font-size:x-large">Mu</span
