<p>And today it all fell apart.  Instead of pre-preparing dinner when
Delphine was at kindergarten, I read my book, and watched The Daily
Show.  As a result, the salmon casserole was nowhere near ready at
5:00, and indeed, wasn’t ready until about 6:30.  So Delphine had
chicken noodle soup, billion-grain toast (I’m serious, there’s no
flour in this freakin’ bread.  It’s all just seeds and nuts packed
together somehow!), and some cherry tomatoes which my parents brought
over last night (in exchange for the apple cake and apple pie and ice
cream).  And after we went out for fish &amp; chips for lunch, too.
Thank god for the tomatoes, or I’ld feel like a completely bad
parent.</p>

<p>And now I’m off to read some more (by which I of course mean watch
some more TV), before turning in for the night.</p>
