<p>I have no idea what happened to last night’s update.  Well, that’s
not entirely true.  I was at a FogBugz demo given by <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a>, and Delphine
had a sleep-over at her Baba and Zaida’s, so I took the time to write
<a
href="http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/2.0/plans/archiveaccess.html"
>a spec</a>, and that led me to whip out a bunch of code.  The spec is
written in something called <a
href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html"
>reStructuredText</a> (uh, that’s the link to the spec, which probably
<i>isn’t</i> the best way to learn about it, but <i>is</i> the
document I’ve been using the most), but my favourite Mac text editor
(<a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/index.shtml"
>TextWrangler</a>) doesn’t support it in any way, shape, or form.  So
I started writing <a
href="http://bzr.latte.ca/files/restwrangler/head" >a plugin</a> that
would teach TextWrangler what the heck reStructuredText was.  (You can
apparently get a tarball of the project from <a
href="http://bzr.latte.ca/tarball/restwrangler/3">this link</a>, if
you’re so inclined, or if you’re not, you could just try <a
href="/static/blake/reST.dmg">the compiled plugin itself</a>.  Just
double-click the .dmg file, then double-click the .bblm file inside of
it, and it’ll tell you what to do.  Or mail me, and I will.)</p>

<p>So yeah, a busy, busy night, but I got to sleep in until 7:00,
which was really nice.  Today was more of the same, except it was
really hot out when Delphine got out of kindergarten, so instead of
playing in the school playground, Delphine and I decided to go to <a
href="http://www.torontolife.com/guide/food/dairies/hollywood-gelato/"
>Hollywood Gelato</a>, the local ice cream store.  Tasty.  Tomorrow
Amy gets home, so it’s looking like it’ll be a pretty busy day as
well.</p>
