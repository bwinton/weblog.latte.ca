<h3><a href="http://grbmozilla.wordpress.com/">Daniel</a>’s QuickLook Support</h3>
<p>There’s <a href="http://bitbucket.org/libras2909/qlplugin/src">an extension</a>
which adds QuickLook support to Thunderbird.  To run correctly, it needs
a patch to msgHdrOverlay (included in the repo).</p>
<p>The extension is also packaged as a set of changes to Thunderbird, which
you can find <a href="http://bitbucket.org/libras2909/ql-enabler/src">over here</a>.  Daniel is working on testing those changes and then turning them
into a patch which we can review, and eventually add to Thunderbird.
For now, the changes to Thunderbird need to go in a qlxpcom subdirectory
under mailnews/extensions, and there are two diffs which need to be
applied.  See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=457546">bug 457546</a> for updates.</p>
<h3><a href="http://ilienert.wordpress.com/">Ian</a>’s Improved Attachment Handling</h3>
<p>Ian decided that the easiest way forward on this would be to concentrate
on the <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/users/bwinton_latte.ca/dataminers/summary">DataMiners</a>
extension.  He did all of his work in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ilienert/dataminers/src">a fork</a> on BitBucket, but it has
since been pulled into the official repository.</p>
<hr />
<p>I’m quite happy with the amount of work they both put in, and am looking
forward to seeing them continue to develop their projects in the future.</p>
