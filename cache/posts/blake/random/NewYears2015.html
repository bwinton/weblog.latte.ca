<p>Well, I managed to spend New Year’s Eve lying sick on the couch, and then went
to bed semi-delirious from lack of sleep at 12:08, which kind of sucked, but I’m
still hopeful that 2015 will be better than 2014 was.  I mean, it almost <em>has</em>
to be, right?</p>
<p>Anyways, my first, and so far only, resolution is to consume less and create
more.  When I look back on the year, I find I have spent more of my free time
than I’ld like passively consuming other people’s content instead of making new
things of my own, and that kind of bothers me.  I’m very glad that a large part
of my job involves making things, and that has definitely been rewarding, but
there are also a lot of personal projects I want to start or finish or just push
forward.  And it doesn’t have to be code.  I’ld like to write more blog posts,
to explain the things I’m doing, and why they interest me enough to spend time
on.</p>
