>a spectacular idea</a> for people who don't work downtown, but still
want to be part of the Bike Week Group Commute.  So in a similar vein,
I'ld love to be part of a Pre-Group Commute from Yonge and Davisville
up to Yonge and Lawrence.  I plan on leaving at about 7:00 to make it
an easy ride to Yonge and Lawrence by 7:30.  The route will be over to
Duplex, and then up to Roehampton (just North of Eglinton), and then
up Yonge to Lawrence.</p>

<p>I'll be wearing an orange jacket and a golden helmet, and the back
of my bike will have a black pannier. Hope to see you there!</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> If this <a

holds up, I'll skip the orange jacket and just go with a black "<a

t-shirt instead.</p>
