<p>Yup, it's raining, and I'm commuting.  And so what happens?  I
bail.  This time I was changing lanes on Queen Street from the center
lane, across the streetcar tracks, into the outside lane in
preparation for turning right.  Now, on a dry day I can take those
streetcar tracks at about a 10Â° angle, but with the metal and
pavement being all wet, I guess I needed to be crossing it a little
more sharply.  Anyways, down I went.  I have a couple of slight
abrasions on my elbow and knee, but neither of them hurt as much as
wiping it down with the first-aid pad.  And it's another lesson
learned, making two.
<b><ol>
<li>Don't use your front brake in the rain.</li>
<li>Don't cross streetcar tracks sideways, especially in the rain.</li>
</ol></b>
At this rate, I'll have enough lessons to write a book by the time I'm 80.</p>
