<p>On my ride home yesterday, it started to rain.  I haven't ridden in
the rain much, so I figured I'ld do a test stop, to see how much
longer it would take me to come to a complete halt.  I waited until I
was on an empty street, fairly close to my home, and peddled until I
got to 32km/h (I usually get to 35km/h on that stretch of street, <a

but I didn't want to push it).  It turns out that at that speed, it
takes me approximately twice as long, which is good to know.<a

I figured I would take it a little slower for the rest of the ride
home.  I made a left, then a right, and then, as I was slowing down
nice and gently, and making the next right, my front wheel hit a patch
of water, and locked up.  The bike turned, and I completely bailed
onto the street, landing on my knee, and then my elbow.  It was kind
of fun sliding down the pavement on a layer of water.  Sort of like a
Slip-N-Slide.  I picked myself up, used the rest of the water in my
bottle to rinse off the worst of the gravel, and biked home, where Amy
scrubbed the injuries with a washcloth, and put some Polysporin on
them to heal.  They're already looking a lot better, and they don't
hurt much, so I'm hoping for a swift recovery, with minimal scarring.
