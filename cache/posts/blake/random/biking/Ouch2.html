<p>As you may remember, I <a
href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake/random/biking/Ouch.html">fell off
my bike</a> a few weeks ago.  Well, ever since then, my shoulder has
been hurting if I tried to raise it horizontally with my palm up.
This morning, I went to my wife's chiropracter to see if she could
tell me why, and what was up with it.  After moving my arm in a bunch
of ways, she determined that I did something with my rotator cuff, and
so I'm going to see her again on Thursday, and she gave me a strange
exercise to do in the meantime.  I'm not exactly sure how the <a
href="http://patients.uptodate.com/topic.asp?file=bone_joi/8115">pendulum
stretching exercise</a> will help, but that's the second reference
I've found to it, so I guess it does something.  (She suggested I do
it without the weight, though.  Actually, she didn't mention a weight
at all, but I think my arm is probably heavy enough to have some
benefit as it is.)  Similarly, the muscles on the knee that I came
down on are far tighter than the ones on the other side, so I suspect
we'll be working on that as well in the coming visits.</p>

<p>I'll have to remember to ask her on Thursday how long she thinks it
will take to heal up.  Here's hoping it gets better sooner (like the
"2-4 weeks minimum" listed on the previous webpage), instead of later
(like the "never" listed on the previous webpage).</p>
