<p>In pseudo-preperation for biking from North of Barrie back to
Toronto, I've bought a new set of tires for my bike.  So now, instead
of the 2" knobbies, I'm riding on a set of 1.5" slicks.  I haven't
noticed the difference so far, but it's a fairly short ride from <a
href="http://www.ucycle.com">the bike shop</a> to <a
href="http://www.phantomfiber.com/location_contact.php">my office</a>,
and along the way, I was carrying my old tires.  I'm hoping that I'll
notice more of a difference on my ride home.</p>

<p>But that's not really why I'm posting this.  (I'm also not posting
this in an attempt to drown out Amy's talk of cute children and
chcoclate cake.)  I'm posting this because just this morning, I
changed my tires for the first time in my life!  It's true, I've never
had a flat before, and I was a little nervous about getting one one my
big trip, but now that I've changed both the front and the back wheel,
I see how easy it really is, and it's no longer a concern for me.
(The instructions I heard from a guy at <a href="http://www.mec.ca/"
>MEC</a> last Bike Week really helped, and it's really just not that
hard, although I expect it's a little trickier when it's pouring
rain.)</p>

<p>In other news, does anyone know of a good bike route from <a
