today, just after crossing the railroad bridge, heading on to
Summerhill, I noticed a man poking at his bicycle.  I stopped, and
asked if he needed a hand, and sure enough, he did.  He seemed to have
gotten his chain wedged around his <a

bracket</a>, in such a way that the arms of the <a
href="http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_sp-ss.html#spider" >Spider</a>
were attempting to push the top and bottom pieces of the chain
<i>through</i> the <a
href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ch.html#chainstay"
>chainstay</a>.  That obviously wasn’t working, so I grabbed my
multitool, and attempted to use the largest <a
href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_aa-l.html#allen">Allen key</a>
to try to lever it out.  When that too failed, I pulled out the one
tool in my collection I’ve never used: The <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_tool">Chain Tool</a>.  After
a few tries, I eventually got the chain apart, after which it was an
not-so-easy matter of threading it out through the gap between the
spider and the chainstay, re-threading it onto the <a
href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ch.html#chainring">chainring</a>,
and re-connecting it.  As a final gesture of goodwill/parting gift, I
gave him my last 2007 <a

(Yeah, I know the link is to the 2006 page.  They really have to
update that sometime...)  After all that, I got to the office 15
minutes late.  (Well, 15 minutes later.  I didn’t have a meeting or
anything, and our core hours don’t start until 10:00.)  But I’ve got
to say, that was 15 minutes well spent, since it made the rest of my
ride in seem extra-pleasant.<br clear="both"/></p>
