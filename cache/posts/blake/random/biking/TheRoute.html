to Balm Beach on my bicycle.  Well, the date has been set, and it's
this coming Saturday.  I've done a couple of successively longer rides
after the 87km Musselman Lake ride, a 103km ride out to Holland
Landing and back, and a 126km ride up to Keswick and back.  I've
planned out a route (see right), and think it should be a long, but
do-able ride.  It's a little bit longer than my longest ride (which
was yesterday, up to Keswick and back), but I'm going to start earlier
(8:00am from Steeles, instead of 9:00am from Finch), and I don't mind
finishing later.  (I finished the Keswick ride, including taking the
subway home from Finch, at 5:30pm, but these days, it's light out
until almost 9:00pm.  I don't really want to be biking for 13 hours
continuously, but it's good to know that the option is there, if I
decide to stop for a really long lunch, or something.)</p>

<p>I'm not exactly sure what's going on at step "m", so I figure I'll
wing it, depending on how the trail looks, or if there even is a trail
there.<br clear="all"/></p>
