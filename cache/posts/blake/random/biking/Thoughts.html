<p>After a certain point, you don't really get any wetter.<br/>
Even though it's really cold, and I'm totally soaking, it's not a bad ride.<br/>
Wow, it takes a long time to stop.  (I already knew this, and I'm going way slower than I normally would, but that doesn't make it any less true.)<br/>
I could probably do with a new pair of biking gloves.<br/>
The headband I stole from Amy is working wonderfully, though.<br/>
I hereby transfer all the karma I got from giving my tires to <a href="http://www.bikepirates.com/">Bike Pirates</a> to the nice person in the car (a Beemer, even!) who let me turn left into the cemetary front of them.<br/>
Although, thinking about it, I might not have that much karma left, since I'm biking on the sidewalk.  (Up Mount Pleasant beside the Cemetary.  In this weather, there's no way I would feel safe on the road, and there aren't any cross roads or pedestrians, so I'm probably way safer than I would normally be on the sidewalk.)  <a href="http://www.michaelwalker.ca/">Mr. Walker</a>, a bike lane down Mount Pleasant would be most appreciated.<br/>
