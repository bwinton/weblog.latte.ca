<p>This year, <a href="http://arbrown.latte.ca/">Amy</a> and
<a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca">I</a> decided to try the <a href="http://tourdedufflet.blogspot.com/">Tour de
Dufflet</a>.  Okay, so it was more like
<em>I</em> decided to try the Tour de Dufflet, and convinced Amy to come along
with me, but that’s the same, right?  I took a few
notes<sup id="fnref:route1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:route1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:route2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:route2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:route3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:route3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:route4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:route4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:route5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:route5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> on which routes would
be less likely to have a lot of traffic on them, and after my parents
picked up Delphine and Cordelia, we set out.  46 km and 4 hours later,
we arrived home, tired, sore, and full.  I think it was mostly a
success, although Amy was certainly done having fun by the time we were
on the third leg.  The stats were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average speed: 15.0 km/h</li>
<li>Total distance: 46.18 km</li>
<li>Biking time: 3:04:32</li>
<li>Total time (including eating cake): around 4 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve got to say, I’m really pretty impressed with how well Amy did.  To
go from virtually no bicycling to a 46 km trek (and a 46 km trek with a
self-admitted speed freak) is something that a lot of people would skip
out on, or avoid, but she went for it, and went faster than I hoped she
would.  Would we do it again next year?  My guess is no, since it wasn’t
a lot of fun at the end.  On the other hand, if Amy continues to bike
throughout the year, she might just go for it, to see if it’s gotten any
easier.  (I’m hoping to do it next year, as you might have guessed from
the url of the post.)</p>
