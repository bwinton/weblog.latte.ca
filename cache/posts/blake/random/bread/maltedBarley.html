<p>At the Royal Winter Fair this year, Amy picked up a small bag of
malted barley flour, because she likes the taste of malt, and because
we have a recipe for malt bread which calls for malted (not barley)
flour.  We’ve since tried to use it in a few different loaves, and
while I quite enjoy the taste, as little as a quarter of a cup will
make the bread twice as dense as usual, and incredibly sticky to
boot.</p>

<p>It seems like it would be a useful thing to have, so that if you
had a bread that you knew was going to be a little dry for some
reason, you could just add a pinch of the stuff, and moisten it right
up, but I still haven’t figured out how little to put in to get a
slightly-moister bread which doesn’t adhere to the knife.  If I do,
I’ll be sure to post a comment, but until then, if you manage to get
some malted barley flour, be exceedingly sparing in your use of it,
and I’ll continue experimenting and picking bread out of my teeth.</p>
