I go with Blake to drop off Delphine at daycare every morning, and one
morning one of the other toddlers, Claire-Marie, came running to him
and gave him a hug around the knees.  She's just huggy like that.
Then Antonio and Beniam decided
they wanted a piece of the hugging action, so they came over too, and
now every morning when the kids see Blake they all swarm him.  He's like
a rock star.
