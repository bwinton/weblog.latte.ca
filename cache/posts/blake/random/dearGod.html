<p>It's 4:00 on the Friday before I leave for a week-long vacation,
and all of the management-types and sales people left the office an
hour or so ago.  And I'm so bored, it isn't even funny.  The online
forum I usually read isn't being entertaining enough, and I'm not even
getting deluged with email.</p>

<p>I suppose not doing anything isn't really a good reason to
complain, but dammit, I can feel my brain dissolving, and my will to
do anything slipping away.  And I'm not sure why, but I can't bring
myself to play a few rounds of <a
href="http://www.diabloii.net/">Diablo II</a> to pass the time.  And
so I sit, and mindlessly surf the InterWeeb, and chat with whomever's
in the chat room, and wonder how long the construction people in the
office below us will be hammering on our floor.</p>

<p>Hmm.  Perhaps writing an entry about being bored isn't as exciting
as I thought it might be.  Time to switch the topic.  Amy and Delphine
and I are going to visit Amy's parents in Sasketchewan tomorrow
morning.  We'll be gone for a week, and it should be quite fun, since
Amy's parents haven't seen Delphine before.  (Well, they've seen
pictures, but that's hardly the same.)  It's tough to try and decide
what we're going to take, with the added constraint that most of the
stuff we use on a day-to-day basis just isn't going to fit in our
luggage.  (Stuff like the high chair, or the stroller, or the bed rail
that keeps her from falling out of our bed, or even the play mat that
she rolls around on.)  What are we going to do without all the
conveniences of home?  And where are we going to go to hang out in a
city that doesn't have a Starbucks or a Second Cup, or even a Tim
Hortons?  (There is a local coffee shop, but its non-smoking section
wasn't separately ventilated, and noticibly smelled of smoke the last
time we were there.  I don't consider myself a non-smoking Nazi, but I
really don't want my baby daughter exposed to a know carcinogen.  That
also brings up the problem of my mother-in-law smoking.  It's her
house, and I don't feel comfortable asking her to stop smoking, but I
also don't want Del to have to breath it in.  I'm not sure what I'm
going to do.  Hopefully Amy will have some ideas, or won't care, and
I'll take my cues from her.)</p>

<p>So yeah, I'll be without the internet for all next week.  That'll
be a bit of a change.  I can't imagine what I'll do.  Fortunately,
we'll be taking the laptop, so I might get the chance to write some
code on a new Palm program that I've been thinking of.  With any luck,
I'll still be able to blog while I'm out there.  Or, at least, store
up the blogs on my Palm for posting when I get back.  We'll see how
well it works.  And I think I'll stop there, because Columbine joined
chat, and he's usually interesting.</p>
