was chatting with both <a href="http://www.tantastik.org/">Tan</a> and
<a href="http://book.amberdragon.ca/">Kate</a> recently, and they each
mentioned how much Delphine looked like me.  I completely agree, and
have the photo to prove it.</p>

<p>No, that's not actually my sister and my daughter.  That's my
mother and I, circa 1976(-ish.  I'm guessing that I was three in the
photo).<br clear="both"/></p>
