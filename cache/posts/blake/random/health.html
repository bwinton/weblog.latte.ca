I'm going to the doctor tomorrow.  The last time I was there, she
told me that my blood pressure was too high, and that she wanted
to put me on medication for the rest of my life.  (Of course,
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/"><img src="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/weblog/LatteHeart.png"

think I've got a certain gift for re-interpretation.)  I
convinced her that I have the willpower to change my lifestyle,
and she agreed that I could try that for a few months and see if
it made a difference.  Well, my lifestyle has changed. I now get
out to the gym three or four days a week, and my salt intake has
dropped from its previous high level to something quite low, but
I'm not sure if my blood pressure has gone down any.  (I took it
after my last round of exercising and it was 128/92, which is
just over the high end of normal) It doesn't make things any
better that I'm starting to stress about the appointment
tomorrow, which is sure to drive it up.  Well, I guess the only
thing to do is go and get it done tomorrow, and live with the
consequences.  I guess my biggest concern now is whether I'll
continue to live this new, healthier lifestyle if it's not making
any difference to my health.
