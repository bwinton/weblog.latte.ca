Well, the doctor took my blood pressure, and it's gone down to
140/85, which is within the normal range, so I won't have to take
any medication.  Woo.  The thing that I'm the most glad about,
strangely enough is that I can affect my health by the things I
do.  It's nice to know that something as simple as working out a
little, and not putting salt in the water when I boil pasta means
that I don't have to take a pill.  Of course, it's also kind of
annoying, since now I feel that much more responsible for my
health.  Oh well, two sides to every coin, I suppose.
