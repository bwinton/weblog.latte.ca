<p>Well, I meant to write something about turning 30 here last week,
when I had the whole week off, but somehow I didn't have the time.  In
my defense, I watched many movies, read four books, and went to the
zoo, so it isn't as if I was sitting around doing nothing.  I did get
some truly excellent presents from Amy.  Underwear, books, and a NetMD
(<a href="http://makeashorterlink.com/?B258129C3">this one</a>), which
I've been listening to almost constantly, making various mixes of full
albums (Norah Jones, and NWA), random songs (Blue Man Group), and even
some BBC Radio Plays (The His Dark Materials series, which spans two
minidiscs at the highest compression!  7&frac12; hours of radio play,
taken from RealAudio, through MP3 to ATRAC3-LP4).  Other than the new
stuff, 30 seems awfully similar to 29, which I'm sure comes as no big
surprise to anyone.  Um, and that's all about 30.</p>

On to equally interesting news.  I worked out again today, pushing
the weights up a little from where I had them last week just to see
how more weight would feel.  Not so bad, so I think I'm going to use
the new settings next time.  After I worked out, I had a blood
pressure of 127 over 85, which continues to be just fine, although
we'll see what the ham I'm having for dinner will do to it.  And
tomorrow I (hopefully) play some squash with Andy Cain, which will be
a nice aerobic workout to go with the anaerobic stuff I did this
evening.
