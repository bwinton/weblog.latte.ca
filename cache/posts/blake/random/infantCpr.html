Yesterday Amy and I took a full-day course in <i>Child and Infant
CPR</i> from St. John Ambulance. <a href="http://www.sja.ca/"><img

covered a wide range of topics, since they had to cover the core First
Aid topics as well as the more small-person-specific stuff.  It seemed
to boil down to a couple of simple steps to follow for pretty much any
sort of emergency.  First, make sure it's safe.  Second, send someone
for medical help (911).  Third, make sure they're breathing.  Fourth,
make sure they're not bleeding.  The instructor had a lot of good
stories, and seemed to know her stuff fairly well, which made it
easier to learn from her, I think.  And I am very glad that I learned
the stuff, even though I hope I'll never have to use it.
