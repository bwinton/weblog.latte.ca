<p>I've been keeping a small tupperware full of miso paste in the
fridge at the office for the past few months.  It seemed like
something that I could use to supplement my lunches, or as a nice
alternative to coffee when I was in need of a hot liquid.  In
related news, I'm feeling a little under the weather today due to
being in the middle of a cold I got from my wife, or perhaps
daughter, and since all I have for lunch is a baloney sandwich,
and some salad, I thought that it would be the perfect thing to
clear my sinuses, and give me a little boost of wellness.
Hah.</p>

<p>I'll be the first person to grant that miso paste looks a
little like something that's gone off, and it's nice that people
are clearing out the fridge, but man is that ever bad timing.
Worse, since payday isn't until today, and there wasn't enough in
the bank account for me to take out any spending money, so I
can't even buy an overpriced chicken noodle soup from the food
court.  So I ended up having a cup of coffee, but it just wasn't
the same somehow.  At least I got in early, so I'll be able to go
home in a couple of hours, and have some soup there.</p>

<p>Hah!  And just as I finished writing my tale of woe, it
started raining.  Man, what a day!</p>
