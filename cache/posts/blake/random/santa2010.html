<p>Dear Santa,</p>
<p><a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/stuff/xmasList2010.html">Everyone else</a> is
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/delphine/santa2010.html">doing it</a>, so here’s my
list, too.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Blu-Ray of a fireplace, perhaps with a secondary audio track of
  christmas music.</li>
<li>Dollhouse Season 2 on Blu-Ray.</li>
<li>Books are always nice.  I’m in the mood for one of Ian Banks' Culture
  series, but I’m not sure which ones I haven’t read.</li>
<li>Whichever Usagi Yojimbo collections I’m missing.</li>
<li>Another two (<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/cubegoodies/bbe8/?source=google_toys&amp;cpg=ogty1&amp;gclid=CO6b2MH-5qUCFU0J2godRD-TtA">or three!</a>) sets of BuckyBalls.  (I would get <a href="http://zenmagnets.com/">Zen Magnets</a>, but I’ve already got BuckyBalls, and I don’t
  think I want to mix them.</li>
<li>a digital photo frame, for the office.</li>
<li>A tiny usb <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/usb-gadgets/c609/">monitor</a>.  (There are also
  touch-screen versions for more money, but I’m a little leery about them.)</li>
<li>Perhaps an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> to play around with.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that’s all I can think of off the top of my head.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Blake.</p>
