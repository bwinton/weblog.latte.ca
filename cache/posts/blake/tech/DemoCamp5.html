<p>I took a few notes at <a href="http://barcamp.org/TorCampDemoCamp5"
>DemoCamp 5</a> last night, and thought I'ld throw them up on the
web, in case anyone found them useful.</p>

<p>First, some notes on giving a good demo.<br/>
In no particular order:
<ul>
  <li>Set your screensaver's timeout to something long, so that you
    aren't continually hitting the spacebar/moving the mouse.</li>
  <li>Repeat the questions, so that people in the back can hear what
    was being asked.</li>
  <li>Log on before connecting the video.  I forget why, other than it
    looked a little more professional, perhaps.  Maybe someone forgot
    their password, or mistyped their username.</li>
  <li>Have someone type for you, so that you can concentrate on what
    you're saying, instead of trying to come up with fake data.</li>
  <li>When the demo's run out of time, don't try to fit in just one
    more thing...  Unless you have someone who can continue typing
    while you're answering questions.  ;)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The next thing that struck me as sort of odd was that all the
presentations were web-based.  Isn't anyone working on a regular
desktop program anymore?</p>

<p>Finally, I also had some specific comments for <a
href="http://blogmatrix.blogmatrix.com/">BlogMatrix</a>, which I
posted as a <a
href="http://davidjanes.com/cgi-bin/xyx999.cgi?entry_id=3619"
>comment</a> on <a href="http://blog.davidjanes.com/">David Janes'
blog</a>.  (I've chatted with David over email a while ago, so I was
paying particular attention to his demo.)</p>

<p>In other DemoCamp news, I got a <a
href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/000467.html"
>shout-out</a> from <a
href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/">Greg Wilson</a>, which was very
gratifying, but I'm afraid I might have given him slightly the wrong
impression.  I suppose I do think that educators have a responsiblity
to prepare students for the real world, but I don't think that it's
the University-level educators who have that responsibility.  I think
that programming (by which I really mean logical thinking, but
programming is one of the best ways I know of to teach it, since the
results are very clearly right or wrong) should be one of the
mandatory courses in high school.  By the time you get to University,
you should be learning stuff like Lisp/Scheme, or ML, or concurrency,
or finite state machines.  Stuff that won't help you get a job, but
will hopefully help you do your job better, if only by expanding your
mind, and giving you new approaches to solving problems, or new
insights into what might be causing the problems in the first place.
I think that Institutions of Higher Learning should be about Higher
Learning, and leave the more vocational stuff to vocational schools.
This is somewhat ironic, since I went to Waterloo for the co-op
experience, one of the most vocational schools and programs out
there.</p>

<p>It could be that I'm looking at this all wrong, and that
universities are there to prepare you for a job, and then, once you're
out in the Real World, you go to places like <a
href="http://web.engcorp.com/pygta">PyGTA</a>, or DemoCamp, or even
just watch <a
href="http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/"
>some videos</a> and join <a
href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lispme">a mailing list</a> about
Scheme to do your real learning.  Or maybe I just didn't follow the
academic path far enough.  When I left, I was <i>really</i> glad to
get the hell out of there, but now that I've been in the workforce for
a few years...  Wait, 7 years?  How did that happen?  Anyways, now
that I've been in the workforce, I'm thinking that I would like to go
back and try to get my Masters, or even my PhD in Computer Science.
At U of T, this time, since I far prefer living in Toronto to living
in Waterloo.</p>
