<p>And I’m happy to use them!</p>
<p>My company uses vss for our version control, (I know.  That should be
“for our ‘version’ ‘control’”,) and we had recently announced a code
freeze for an impending release.  Thanks to bzr-loom, which I downloaded
and installed on my birthday (the 5th), I could continue to push ahead
with my work, and pop down and fix bugs in the frozen code when it
became necessary, and never lose my history, and not have to deal with
copying directories back and forth.  Heck, by adding a thread for each
proposed future VSS checkin, I even had a reasonable history in VSS
when it came time to check everything in.</p>
<p>Thank you, Robert, for making my job far more bearable.</p>
