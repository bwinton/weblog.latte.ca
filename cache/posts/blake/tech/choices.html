<p>So I hit the Apple Store in the Eaton Center again today, to play
with the iPod Touch a little more, and now I’m kind of sad that I did.
There seem to be a few things about it that I don’t know if I can deal
with.  First, the screen apparently uses a <a
href="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/ipod-touch2.htm">capacitive
screen</a>, which basically means that you need to use your fingers to
touch it.  No slightly-longer-than-normal thumbnails, no left-over spare
stylii, nothing that could make the large surface area of my stubby
fingers slightly smaller.  This turned out to be a little annoying when
I was trying to type.  I would probably get used to it if it weren’t for
the second problem.  Very few of the apps seem to support landscape-mode
text input.  Where by "very few", I mean "only Safari".  The keyboard in
portrait-mode is just a little too small for my fingers.  Bah, who am I
kidding?  The keyboard in landscape-mode is just a little too small for
my fingers.  The keyboard in portrait-mode is way too small for my
fingers.</p>

<p>So, I can’t really type on it.  That’s a fairly big problem.  But at
least I can download videos and music from my website, so that when I’m
at the office, and I see that my long DVD-to-iPod conversion has
finished, I can grab a copy of it over HTTP to watch on the commute
home…  But when I tried it, it was a total no-go.  None of the avis
worked, which isn’t totally surprising, but the mp3s in the same
directory also gave me the “Safari is unable to download this file”.
WTF?!?  An MP3 player that can’t play MP3s?  The biggest downside of
this whole trip is that I can’t really think of a good way around either
of those problems.  I mean, I guess text editors will come out which
allow landscape-mode keyboards, but it’s going to be annoying every time
I go to enter a new appointment, or contact.  And I don’t have any idea
what I could do to get around the no-downloading stuff. So I guess I’m
back to looking at other options (and maybe ending up asking Jeremy for
my SD Card back).  And no, I don’t think the Nintendo DS is a reasonable
replacement.  It’s too… game-y.  Not enough like an actual PDA.</p>
