<p>Well, mail works now, as does web and even the cute little
weblog script, but logging on an X session at the console fails
pretty heinously.  (Specifically, rxvt fails complaining that it
couldn't open the pseudo-tty, or could not obtain control of tty,
depending on what random bit I flipped before I tried to launch
it.)  Plain old xterm seems to work just fine, though.  More
debugging later, I guess.  For now, I'm just going to go to sleep.
