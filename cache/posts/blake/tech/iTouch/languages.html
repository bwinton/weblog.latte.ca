<p>Yeah, like I was done messing with my iTouch.  Whatever.</p>

<p>I've been playing around a lot with the iTouch, and developing
quite a few programs for it.  The first one was by request, although
I’m also finding it very useful.  (And apparently a <a
href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?p=4754458">few other
people</a> are as well!  Cool!)  It’s called <a
href="http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/~chris/iphone/WifiToggle/"
>WifiToggle</a>, and it’s a small app that simply toggles on and off
your Wifi connection, so as to save batteries.  The next thing I did
was <a href="http://iphone.latte.ca/info/Javascript.html">a port</a>
of the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/">SpiderMonkey
Javascript</a> interpreter.  It works, and it wasn’t that hard to get
compiled and installed, which is really pretty cool when you stop to
think about it.</p>

<p>The final thing I got working just tonight (which I was playing
around with mostly to take my mind off of stuff.  See tomorrow’s post
for details), was <a
href="http://iphone.latte.ca/info/GambitScheme.html">a port</a> of the
<a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/wiki/index.php/Main_Page"
>Gambit Scheme</a> interpreter.  I know, Scheme is just like
Javascript, only with an uglier syntax, but I still like it, and
hopefully the lack of punctuation will make it easier to use on the
iTouch.  Heh.</p>

<p>Anyways, if you own an iPhone or iTouch, and have jailbroken it, be
sure to add <a href="http://iphone.latte.ca/"
>http://iphone.latte.ca/</a> to your list of Installer sources, and
geek out!</p>
