<p>Okay, one game in particular this time.  One of my favourites from
back in my Palm days.</p>
<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=297288395&amp;mt=8">Bike Or Die 2</a>.<br/>

<p>It’s awesome.  It’s harder than I remember the Palm version being, but
that's probably as much because I'm out of practice as anything else.
After a couple of weeks of playing the beta version, I’m now at the
point where I rarely hit the wrong button, even though they're
on-screen instead of being hard buttons.</p>
<p>Not only is it a great game for what it is, but it’s got a ton of
<a href="http://bike.toyspring.com/levels.php">user-created levels</a>, and an
online <a href="http://bike.toyspring.com/view.php">high score board</a> (which
I’m <a href="http://bike.toyspring.com/player.php?p=35">nowhere near</a> the top
of).  The re-playability of this game is stunning.</p>
<p>If you're still undecided, you can read <a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=1318">the
thread</a> about it
on TouchArcade.  (Yeah, I’ve been answering a bunch of questions over
there.)  There’s also <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bikeordie">a video</a> showing
gameplay from the beta.</p>
<p>Finally, it only costs $2.99, but I hear it’s going up to $7 after the
introductory period is over.  (I suggested he sell it for $7.99-$9.99,
but he’s apparently a nicer person than I am.)</p>
<p>(No, he’s not paying me for this.  Heck, I didn’t even get an iTunes
gift certificate for all my hard work finding bugs.  I just really
like the game.)</p>
