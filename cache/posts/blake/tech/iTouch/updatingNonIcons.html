<p>Last night I was browsing the newest iTouch apps, and I saw one called
<a href="http://www.iamas.ac.jp/%7Eaka/iphone/#LEDBanner.app">LEDBanner</a>.  It
allowed you to scroll text across your screen as if your screen was a
set of LEDs.  My only problem with it was that I couldnâ€™t
programmatically change the text.  Fortunately the source was
available, and so, with only minor changes, I now have <a href="/static/blake/LEDBanner.zip">a
version</a> which
lets me change the text to whatever I want.</p>
<p>For instance, the following scheme code:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14</pre></div></td><td class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>#! /usr/bin/gsi
(define (flmod x y) (fl- x (fl* (floor (fl/ x y)) y)))
(define (%100 time) (flmod (floor (time-&gt;seconds time))
(fixnum-&gt;flonum 100)))
(define (f)
  (begin
    (with-output-to-file
      (list
        path: &quot;~/Library/Preferences/org.akamatsu.LEDBanner.msg&quot;
        truncate: #t)
      (lambda () (display (%100 (current-time)))))
    (thread-sleep! 3)
    (f)))
(f)
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

<p>changes the text every three seconds to the number of seconds, modulo
100.  Which turns out to be a mostly-random number, as shown below.</p>
