<p>Cc:-ed to the MacPython list, because they might know.</p>
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I'm trying to get Subversion bindings for my installed version of
MacPython (/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/)  This
seems to mean that I want to install Subversion, and if so, I would
like to get it hooked up to Apache so that I can connect to
http://svn.latte.ca/ (or whatever) on my work computer and access my
home repository.</p>

<p>Now, I can install the subversion python bindings using
DarwinPorts, but that won't hook into the Framework version of Python,
so I've downloaded the Subversion 1.3.2 sources, and I can build them,
but they complain about my version of Apache.  Specifically, about
apxs being too old.</p>

<p>Do I really need to upgrade apache to Apache 2 to get this all
working?</p>

<p>Is there a good way of replacing the default Apache with Apache 2,
or is that a really bad idea because the Software Update will get
horribly confused?</p>

<p>Is there another place I should be asking these questions?</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />
Blake.</p>
