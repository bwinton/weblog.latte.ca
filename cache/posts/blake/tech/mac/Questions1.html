<p>Okay, y'all know by now that we've got a new Mac.  And in the grand
tradition of new computers, I'm trying to burn up all the hard drive
space with fun or useful utilities.  Since this is pretty much my
first exposure to OSX, anything goes, since I probably haven't heard
of it.</p>

<p>Having said that, here's what I have found:
<ul><li><a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">QuickSilver</a></li>
<li>I installed <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a>, but I don't
think anything is using it, other than <a
href="http://transmission.m0k.org/">Transmission</a>.</li>
<li><a
href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a>
(Freeware, from the people who make <a
href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml">BBEdit</a>)
is surprisingly my editor of choice.  (Well, except for this post.)  I
was sure I'ld stick with vim, being old-skool like that, but I find I
want to save my Terminal window for running things, and edit my source
in an editor.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Oh, and the two neat new tricks I've learned so far are:
<ul><li>Command-Shift-4, then the spacebar to take a screenshot of
just one window, and</li>
<li><pre>sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowText -string "My Funny Message!!!"</pre>
to print a message on the login window.</li>
</ul></p>
