So, I've just added the capability to update the weblog over the web.
Should be a nice feature for those sad days when the SSH daemon dies
unexpectedly.  And it works fairly well too.  I wonder how well it
deals with updates?  Oh, and I should also make it output the text in
a nicer format, but that's all stuff for later.  I've also got the
XML-RPC interface working, so I can use desktop tools from work to
post and modify entries.
