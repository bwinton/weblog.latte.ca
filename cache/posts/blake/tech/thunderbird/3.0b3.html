<p><a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/about/press/archive/2009-07-21-01">It’s true</a>,
after a lot of hard work, and a few hard decisions, the first version of
Thunderbird that has code of mine in it has shipped.  Dan Mosedale has
<a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/dmose/archives/2009/07/thunderbird_30b3_shipped.html">some comments</a>
on what’s changed.  If you like Thunderbird, please download it, give it a try,
and let me know what you think!</p>
<p>On a more personal note, the thing I did on this release that I’m the most
proud of was to add a button that lets you reply to a mailing list.</p>
<p><img alt="Reply to a mailing list" src="/images/blake/ReplyToList3.0b3.png" title="The Reply-To-List Button."></p>
<p>I’m proud of it because it feels like a neat-but-still-usable UI, and because
it is one more step on the road to getting people to change their mailing lists
to <a href="http://woozle.org/~neale/papers/reply-to-still-harmful.html">not munge the Reply-To header</a>.  (With this
patch, you are given the option of replying to the list, or the author.  Unless
the list has set the Reply-To to point to the list, in which case you can only
mail the list.)</p>
<p>A couple of the other areas I worked on for this release were updating the
Activity Manager so that it didn’t hang when you clicked “Clear Now”, and
so that it merged a bunch of move/copy/delete notifications into a single
notification that told you how many messages had been processed; and fixing
a some layout and logic bugs in the Autoconfig dialog (which you get to
from “File » New » Mail Account (Quick Setup)…”).  Yeah, the Autoconfig
dialog is still kind of ugly, but it’s better now than it used to be, and
I’m working on making it prettier for beta 4.</p>
