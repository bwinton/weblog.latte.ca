<p>Over the past week, I’ve been working on fixing some of <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/opensearch/issues">the reported
bugs</a> in the OpenSearch
add-on for Thunderbird, and now I think I’ve <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/opensearch/issues/closed">fixed enough</a> of them to release a
new version.  </p>
<p>You can find the full details on <a href="http://mozillalabs.com/messaging/2011/02/25/opensearch-updated/">the Mozilla Labs blog</a>, or you
could just jump straight to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/opensearch/">the OpenSearch add-on page</a> to install
it.  And please leave your feedback about the add-on on <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/mozilla-labs/t1wGyH8CDmQ/discussion">our Google group</a>!</p>
