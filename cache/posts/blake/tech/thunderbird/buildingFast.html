<p>I’m always looking for ways to speed up my Mozilla build, since it allows
me to test my changes even quicker.  I was really excited when I found out
about <tt>make -s tier_app</tt>, since it sped up my compiles by a huge
amount.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>make
real    10m22.630s
user    4m28.072s
sys     1m27.807s
</pre>


<p>vs.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>make -s tier_app
real    0m14.426s
user    0m6.502s
sys     0m3.957s
</pre>


<p>But yesterday, on IRC, I heard about <tt>libs_tier_app</tt>, which is ever
faster, if you haven’t changed any IDL files (which I usually don’t).</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>make -s libs_tier_app
real    0m9.407s
user    0m5.440s
sys     0m3.065s
</pre>


<p>Okay, it’s not nearly as good as going from 10 and a half minutes to 15
seconds, but a 30% (or is it 50%) speedup is still nothing to sneer at.</p>
