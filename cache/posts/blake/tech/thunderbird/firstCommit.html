<p><a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/thunderbird/FirstPatch">A while ago</a> I had my
first patch to Thunderbird committed.</p>
<p><a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/comm-1.9.1/pushloghtml?startdate=2009-10-28+11%3A00&amp;enddate=2009-10-28+11%3A20">Today</a> I pushed my first patch, all by myself.</p>
<p>It’s kind of exciting, having checkin privileges.  It means that I
don’t have to wait for someone else to check in my changes once
they’re accepted.  But on the downside, it means that I’m the one who
has to do the commit, and watch the <a href="http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=Thunderbird3.0">Tinderbox</a>, and
if anything goes wrong, I’m even more on the hook than I previously
was.  (Well, that last part isn’t really true, but I feel way more
nervous than when I could just add “checkin-needed” to the bug, and
not worry about it anymore.)  And basically there’s just a lot of new
stuff for me to keep track of, and figure out.  But since anything I
do is going to show up in the official history, I need to figure it
out <em>before</em> I do it, which always adds a little pressure, which in
this case is probably a good thing.</p>
