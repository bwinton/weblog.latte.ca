<p>As someone who works on an email client, I’m interested in making
my communications more secure.  So, with the assistance of
<a href="http://perso.hirlimann.net/~ludo/blog/">Ludovic</a> and
<a href="http://gozer.ectoplasm.org/blog/">Gozer</a>, I got a client certificate that
would allow me to sign and encrypt my messages.  (Check out the envelope
and lock in the image below.)</p>

<p>Most of the time, I’ll probably just sign my messages – after all, that’s
what I’ve set it up to do by default – but it’s nice to know that if
there’s something I need to encrypt, that option is now available to me.</p>
