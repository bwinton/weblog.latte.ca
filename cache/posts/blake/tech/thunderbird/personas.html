<p>I’ve been reviewing a patch from <a href="http://www.andreasn.se/blog/">Andreas</a>
and <a href="http://ccgi.standard8.plus.com/blog/">Standard8</a> which adds
lightweight theme support (aka personas) to Thunderbird.  It’s so cool that
I couldn’t resist taking a screenshot, and posting it for you all to see!</p>
<p><img alt="Pretty new persona" src="/images/blake/Thunderbird/Personas.png" title="Oooh, fancy."></p>
<p>It looks like there’s a good chance the code will make it in to Thunderbird
3.1 beta 2, so with any luck, soon your Thunderbird will be a pretty as
mine.</p>
