<p><a href="http://ehsanakhgari.org/blog">A co-worker</a> of mine recently mentioned that
he had a problem where he all-too-often accidentally quit his applications
by hitting ⌘-q (command-q).  Since he has been having problems with
Thunderbird that I can’t fix, I thought I might do a little digging and see
if I could come up with some way of helping him.  And so here’s what I
found:</p>
<p>In the System Preferences application, there’s a “Keyboard” section.</p>
<p><img alt="The Keyboard Preference Pane" src="/images/blake/Quit/1-Keyboard.png" title="Keyboard"></p>
<p>One of the things you can choose in that section is “Keyboard Shortcuts”.</p>
<p><img alt="The Keyboard Shortcuts" src="/images/blake/Quit/2-Shortcuts.png" title="Shortcuts"></p>
<p>Pick a relatively innocuous function, like turning Zoom on and off.</p>
<p>(Note: DO NOT choose Front Row for this!)</p>
<p><img alt="The Access Shortcuts" src="/images/blake/Quit/3-Access.png" title="Access"></p>
<p>And assign that function to ⌘-q.</p>
<p><img alt="The New Shortcut" src="/images/blake/Quit/4-⌘Q.png" title="⌘Q"></p>
<p>Now, whenever you hit ⌘-q, it will do whatever you selected, instead of
quitting the application.  Ta-da!</p>
