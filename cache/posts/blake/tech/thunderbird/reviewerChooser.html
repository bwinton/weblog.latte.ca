<p>One of the big questions I had when I started writing patches was who I
should ask to review them.  Now that I’ve been in the community for a
while, I’ve got a much better sense of who I should be talking to for the
type of things I’m likely to write, but there are still times when I want
to make a change in a part of the code that I haven’t touched before, and
I’m not sure who to ask.  In those cases, I usually fall back to a fairly
simple (if non-obvious) set of steps to try and figure out who to pick.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the list of files I’ve changed.</li>
<li>Get the hg log for those files.</li>
<li>Check through the log for “r=”, and “sr=”.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, that’s a fairly easy set of steps to automate, and so I present
my first cut at <a href="https://github.com/bwinton/Mozilla-Tools/blob/master/getReviewer.py">the automated reviewer chooser</a>!</p>
<p>Of course, there are a lot of things I’ld like to do with this, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving the documentation.</li>
<li>Checking to see how well this script would have done on previous commits.</li>
<li>Taking into account the length of the queues for the reviewers.</li>
<li>Adding some sort of recent-ness calculations.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I think that this tool is useful enough in its current state that
releasing it and getting feedback on what to actually work on would be a
win.</p>
<p>To use it, be in a mercurial source repo, and type <code>getReviewer.py</code> to get
a list of suggested reviewers for the current differences, or
<code>getReviewer.py temp.diff</code> or <code>getReviewer.py
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi\?id\=536017</code> to specify a
different set of changes.</p>
