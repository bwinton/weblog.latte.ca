<p>For your reading pleasure this week, we have a guest post from <a href="mailto:wxwoo@uwaterloo.ca">Wei Xian
Woo</a>.  Wei is a student working on
<a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/">Thunderbird</a> as part of
<a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com/">UCOSP</a>, and has just had <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=408338">his first
bug</a> marked as
FIXED.  Anyways, that’s enough out of me.  Here’s Wei’s post:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Programming Thunderbird in Visual Studio.</h3>
<p>During this term’s Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Projects (UCOSP)
Code Sprint held at the University of Toronto in January, I wrote a
simple Python script for the Thunderbird team to make setting up a
Visual C++ project for Thunderbird slightly easier for those of us
working on Windows. Blake suggested making this script public so others
could benefit from it, so here it is! The script is generic enough to be
used for any project, not just Thunderbird. Feel free to use it and make
modifications as you see fit :)</p>
<h3>Using the script to create a Visual C++ project for Thunderbird</h3>
<p>Create an empty Visual C++ project in Visual Studio.</p>
<p>From the command prompt launched by mozilla-build\start-msvc9.bat, do:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>python /path/to/refreshvcproj.py
--vcproj=/path/to/thunderbird.vcproj --dir=/path/to/gecko-sdk
--dir=/path/to/mozilla/comm-central/mozilla/xpcom
--dir=/path/to/mozilla/comm-central/mail
</pre>


<p>All files in the specified directories will be included in the project.
I suggest including only the directories you will be working with.</p>
<h3>Configuring the project for debugging:</h3>
<p>Open the VC++ project file in Visual Studio, and then open the project's
Properties.</p>
<p>Go to: Configuration Properties -&gt; Debugging.</p>
<p>Set Command to \path\to\objdir\mozilla\dist\bin\thunderbird.exe</p>
<p>Set Environment to XPCOM_DEBUG_BREAK=warn</p>
<h3>And… you’re done!</h3>
<p>For better C++ IntelliSense, you might also want to consider getting
Visual Assist X (an add-on for VS).</p>
<h3>Happy coding!</h3>

<p>Thanks, Wei!</p>
