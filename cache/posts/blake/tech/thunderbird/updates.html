<p>Add-ons are an important part of many Mozilla products, and many people
have noticed that they’ve taken a hit as we’ve switched to the Rapid
Release process.  To help users have a little more control over how well
their Firefox works, I would like to propose the following slight
modification to the automatic Update process:</p>
<p>It all starts when Firefox (and Thunderbird) notice an update is available.</p>
<p>We immediately check the user’s add-ons to see if they are compatible, or
if there are compatible versions we haven’t downloaded yet.</p>
<p>If all the add-ons are compatible (or will be made so at the next
download), we show the NoAddons dialog:</p>
<p><img alt="NoAddons dialog" src="/images/blake/updates/NoAddons.png" /></p>
<p>It‘s the same as the current Firefox or Thunderbird update dialog, and as
you would expect, the “Ask Later” and “Update Firefox” buttons do the same
things that they do now.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if there <em>are</em> in-compatible add-ons, we show the Addons
dialog:</p>
<p><img alt="Addons dialog" src="/images/blake/updates/Addons.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, we let the user know which add-ons are incompatible, and
give the user an extra button at the bottom to do something different.</p>
<p>The new “Update when my add-ons work” button (wording to be clarified
later) will check the add-ons periodically, and automatically update
Firefox when all the add-ons are compatible.  If the add-ons aren’t
compatible after a week (period of time to be configurable), the user will
be shown this dialog again, with the (hopefully smaller) list of
incompatible add-ons.</p>
<p>Showing the user which add-ons are incompatible will let them decide
whether the add-ons are important enough to not upgrade, or whether they
can live with the (hopefully short) period of reduced functionality.</p>
<p>As always, comments welcome, but keep them polite or they’ll be deleted.</p>
