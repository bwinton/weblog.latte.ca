<p>A lot of the code I write for <a href="http://mozillamessaging.com/">Thunderbird</a>
has to work on <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/all.html">all</a> the platforms
it supports.  Since I don’t own a <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Linux</a> or
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7">Windows</a> box, and don’t really
want to waste the hard drive space on my <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/macbookpro/specs.html">MacBook Pro</a> with a dual- or triple-boot
setup, I’ve decided to install the other operating systems on virtual
machines.  (I’ve chosen <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>, because
it’s free, and I’m cheap.  As an added bonus, it works quite well, too.)</p>
<p>If I was forced to use a centralized version control system, this would
lead to a bunch of pain, since I wouldn’t want to check in a half-finished
patch, but I would still really want to see what changes I made for one OS,
to try and figure out what changes I need to make for the others.  And I
would want to be able to keep a record of what I did, step by step, so that
I could undo stuff if it turned out to be a bad idea.  (Hey, that sounds
like a perfect task for a version control system!  ;)</p>
<p>Since Mozilla uses <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>, I didn’t
have to deal with any of that.  I had my repository on the host machine,
which I had cloned from the main repo, and I just cloned it into each of
the virtual machines.  Whenever I started a VM, I pulled the latest set of
changes from the host machine; As I fixed stuff on that platform, I
committed to the repository on the virtual machine; And before I shut down
the VM, I pushed my changes back to the host machine.  When I wanted to see
which changes I made to get things working for the platform, it was easy,
and propagating those changes to the other virtual machines was also easy.</p>
<p>When people talk about the advantages of distributed version control, a lot
of the time they mention being able to still commit your changes when
you’re on an airplane, and sharing in-progress changes with other people,
but for people like me who do mainly self-contained stuff and don’t fly
anywhere, supporting multi-platforms with virtual machines and still being
able to track my changes might just be the killer feature.</p>
