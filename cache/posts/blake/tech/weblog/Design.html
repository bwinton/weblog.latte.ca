<p>Recently, I've been reading <a
href="http://www.ratz.com/robin/books.html">a few books</a> by Robin Williams (the
author, not the actor) about designing for print, and for the web.
One of the things she mentions is that centering looks a little bland,
corporate, boring, and you should instead attempt to align things to
the left or the right.  So I took a few minutes tonight to attempt to
do that with the blog, aligning the stories on the right, mirroring
the strong line of the sidebar, which has changed to left-alignment.
I also changed the boxes to lines on the aligned side.  I'ld love to
hear what you think, if you noticed at all.  (I'm leaving the colour
scheme to Amy.  A large part of design is knowing your
limitations.)</p>
