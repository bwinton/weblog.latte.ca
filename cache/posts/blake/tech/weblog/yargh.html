<p>So, in an attempt to fix Katherine's bug, I've managed to move all
the entries to a couple of days ago.  I moved back the ones that were
in my Bloglines cache, but I don't have the correct dates for prior
ones, so I'm kind of hosed until I look in my backups.  Unless any of
you happen to have them in your caches, of course...</p>

<p>Also, yargh.</p>
