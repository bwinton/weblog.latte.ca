<p>So, itʼs been a couple of weeks, and thought I might write a few notes on how itʼs been going…</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>Yeah, Iʼve gotten a couple of blue-screens over the past few weeks, and every now and then I seem to try something that just doesnʼt work yet (most recently port-forwarding from the Windows Subsystem for Linux.  Works fine in Cygwin, though…), and occasionally the audio just stops playing when I plug in my headphones, necessitating a disable/re-enable of the driver, but all in all, itʼs been a very functional laptop for the kind of stuff Iʼm doing.  (And while I still have my MacBook Pro, Iʼm rarely using it since I got back from Hawaii, and have found that itʼs had a similar number of problems.)</p>
<p>The biggest thing that I got working, I think, was IRC through a bouncer.  My irc client of choice (so far, suggestions still welcome!) is <a href="hexchat">HexChat</a>.  Itʼs not particularly pretty, but itʼs not terrible, and the key bindings mostly work.  Although there are a few oddities that I kind of wish they would fix.  (Yeah, itʼs open source, so I could fix it myself.  Maybe I will, one of these days.)</p>
<p>The other good find was <a href="mac2win">this sub-reddit</a>, which had a number of good tips, like using PhraseExpress (or any other text-replacer) to turn <code>ctrl-w</code> into <code>alt-f4</code>.</p>
<p>I ended up not taking my MacBook Pro to Hawaii, partially to see how well I could live without having it as a backup, but mostly because I didnʼt want to have to carry two laptops and two power bricks.  And while the stuff I do at All-Hands is materially different than the stuff I do at the rest of my job, the Windows laptop worked out just fine for that week, and as I mentioned up above, has sort of gotten me to not use my backup Mac.</p>
