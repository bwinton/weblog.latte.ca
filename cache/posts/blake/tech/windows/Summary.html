<p>Iʼm writing a series about switching to Windows, and thought it would be nice
to have a summary post, with links to all the other ones.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>Post 0 (The one that kinda kicked it all off): <a href="https://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/mac/disappointment.html">My problems with the new MacBooks.</a>\
Post 1: <a href="https://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/windows/Welp.html">Welp, I did it.</a>\
Post 2: <a href="https://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/windows/weekone.html">It’s here!</a></p>
<p>And thatʼs all for now.  Iʼll keep this list updated as I add more posts.</p>
