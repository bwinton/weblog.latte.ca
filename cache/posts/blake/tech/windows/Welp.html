<p>As I mentioned in a <a href="/blake/tech/mac/disappointment.html" title="My problems with the new MacBooks">previous post</a>, I wasn’t really excited by the new MacBooks that were announced this year.  And the more I read the less compelling they seemed…  As I talked with my co-workers, I heard some really good reviews of a couple of models of Windows computers, and since 90% of Firefox’s users are using Windows it’s probably not such a bad idea if I use it, too, both to help me understand the problems they’re running into, and to make sure that the code I’m writing will work for them.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>So on Friday I bit the bullet and ordered a Dell <a href="http://www.dell.com/ca/p/xps-15-9550-laptop/pd?oc=nxps15550_bt_h1609e&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs" title="Link to the Dell Store">XPS 15</a> (with Touch screen, 32Gb RAM, and a 1Tb SSD) for my latest laptop refresh.  I <em>think</em> that the recent updates to the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/2016/04/22/windows-subsystem-for-linux-overview/" title="Windows Subsystem for Linux">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> will let me do all the same Unix-y stuff I’ve been doing on the Mac, and if I use the same keyboard and trackpad, I’m not sure I’ll notice much of a difference, to be honest.</p>
<p><img alt="Dude.  I’m getting a Dell." src="/images/blake/Dell.jpg"></p>
<p>It’s going to be a few weeks before it arrives, which is nice because it lets me think about all the stuff I’ll need to transfer over, and because it lets <a href="http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2016/11/14/switching-sides/" title="Switching Sides">Mike Hoye</a> go through all the pain of switching before I do, so I can hopefully avoid the worst pitfalls.  😉  There is, of course, a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Transitioning_to_Windows#Applications_.26_tools" title="Transitioning to Windows">guide to switching</a> for Mozilla people, but it’s pretty out of date.  I’ll probably be updating it as I run into stuff, and hopefully the other people who are also switching will do the same.</p>
<p>So, here’s the big list of stuff I currently use, and replacements (where I know what they are):</p>
<p>First off, the obvious ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://slack.com/" title="Slack">Slack</a> ⇒ Slack</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" title="Firefox">Firefox</a> ⇒ Firefox</li>
<li><a href="https://about.twitter.com/products/twitter-for-windows/" title="Twitter for Windows">Twitter</a> ⇒ Twitter</li>
<li><a href="https://www.crashplan.com/en-us/" title="Crashplan">Crashplan</a> ⇒ Crashplan</li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html" title="Chrome">Chrome</a> ⇒ Chrome</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, the slightly more complicated ones: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://iterm2.com/" title="iTerm 2">iTerm2</a> ⇒ <a href="http://cmder.net/" title="λcmder">Cmder</a><br>
    Cmder isn’t the same, but it’s the best Windows terminal app I’ve found.<br>
    <em>Update</em>: I might go with <a href="https://conemu.github.io/" title="ConEMU">ConEMU</a>, the program underlying Cmder, instead. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/" title="Safari">Safari</a> ⇒ Also Chrome.  Or maybe <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge" title="Microsoft Edge">Edge</a>.<br>
    I use Safari mostly for YouTube.  I used to use Chrome for this; maybe I’ll go back, or maybe it’s time to try a new browser.  I hear Edge has really good battery life while watching video…  🙂</li>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/" title="Atom">Atom</a> ⇒ Atom (or <a href="http://code.visualstudio.com/" title="Visual Studio Code">Visual Studio Code</a>?)<br>
    I’ve heard not-great things about Atom on Windows, so I’m starting to look into switching to Visual Studio Code.  So far it seems okay…  I do miss the minimap and <a href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-whimsy" title="Atom Whimsy">Whimsy</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home" title="Dropbox">Dropbox</a> ⇒ Dropbox (or <a href="https://drive.google.com/" title="Google Drive">Google Drive</a>, or <a href="https://www.getcloudapp.com/" title="CloudApp">CloudApp</a>?)<br>
    Mozilla moved to Google Apps for our email, and now we have a big shared space there.  Should we really still be paying for Dropbox Pro accounts for our team?  Maybe not…  Of course, I don’t think Google Drive uploads screenshots automatically, so maybe I’ll also need to install CloudApp for that?</li>
<li><a href="https://secure.flyingmeat.com/acorn/" title="Acorn">Acorn</a> ⇒ <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/index.html" title="Paint.net">Paint.net</a><br>
    Totally not the same, but I think paint.net will do <em>most</em> of the stuff I want.</li>
</ul>
<p>After that is the software I’m unsure about alternatives for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://limechat.net/mac/" title="LimeChat for Mac">LimeChat</a><br>
    I’ve been looking for a while, but still haven’t found a beautiful IRC client for Windows.  (Please don’t suggest mIRC, or irssi over ssh…  Anyone who considers those “beautiful” clearly doesn’t share my aesthetic. 😝)  The closest I’ve found has been <a href="http://fooirc.com/#!index.md" title="Foo IRC">Foo IRC</a>, but I’m not sure how well it works.  For some reason I had a pinned tab open on <a href="http://www.icechat.net/site/" title="IceChat">IceChat</a>’s page, but I’m not a big fan of how it looks…<br>
    <em>Update</em>: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/p/irc-explorer/9wzdncrdkmgz" title="IRC Explorer">IRC Explorer</a> looks pretty nice, too… </li>
<li>Mail.app<br>
    I’m not really enthused with Apple’s Mail app, but it’s not terrible.  I hear Microsoft’s Mail app is pretty similar, so I’ll give it a try.</li>
<li><a href="http://xscopeapp.com/" title="XScope">XScope</a><br>
    I don’t think there <em>is</em> anything like XScope on Windows 10.  I might just have to go back to my Mac for the kinda stuff I use it for…
    <em>Update</em>: <a href="http://ngwin.com/picpick" title="PicPick">PicPick</a> looks like it might do some of the stuff XScope does…</li>
</ul>
<p>And things I just don’t know about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calendar.app<br>
    I’m sure there’s <em>something</em> on Windows that does calendaring, but will it connect to my home iCal account?</li>
<li><a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/" title="Things">Things</a><br>
    I don’t use this a ton these days, but it’s good for keeping track of what’s on my plate.  I may just continue to use it on my iPhone…</li>
<li><a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/" title="iTunes">iTunes</a><br>
    I don’t think <a href="http://www.winamp.com/" title="WinAmp">WinAmp</a> or iTunes for Windows are really what I’m looking for here.  I might switch to a combination of <a href="https://play.spotify.com/search/hamilton%20mixtape" title="Spotify">Spotify</a> and my iPhone. </li>
<li><a href="http://anvilformac.com/" title="Anvil for Mac">Anvil</a><br>
    Do I still need to run folders as websites?  Maybe not so much these days, since I’m using <a href="http://webpack.github.io/" title="Webpack">webpack</a>a lot more, and it comes with a dev server. </li>
<li><a href="https://qsapp.com/" title="Quicksilver">Quicksilver</a><br>
    I think I could probably use the Cortana search menu for most of what I use Quicksilver for…</li>
<li><a href="http://www.trankynam.com/atext/" title="aText">aText</a><br>
    This is another one of those “There <em>has</em> to be something like this” apps, but I have no idea what it is.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suggestions for any of the apps mentioned above would be very appreciated!</p>
