<p>A while ago, I wrote an HtmlViewer component for the Palm.  It
was hard, and I made a lot of assumptions on the basis that we
would be getting our data from a server that we would also write,
so it made more sense to have the server do anything that was
necessary to the input stream to make it easier for the small
device to display.  (Things such as figuring out the widths of
table cells, and making sure that any start tag also contained an
end tag.  You know, simple stuff.)  The problem came when we
started using my HtmlViewer to display content that we got from a
client.  The content was a complete mix of tags, and had no hope
in hell of validating.  As well, the server guys were swamped
with other requests, and didn't want to write the code it would
take to fix the html up.  So my component broke.  Colin (a
co-worker) suggested that we just modify what I had to do what we
wanted.  After some discussion, I convinced him that it would be
faster to re-write what was there so that it didn't make the same
assumptions.</p>
