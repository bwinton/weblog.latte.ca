We went to the cardiologist for Cordelia's follow-up visit,
and as suspected she's fine.  The doctor couldn't find any
abnormality in the EKG or the ultrasound.  Like Dave said,
it was just a startup problem -- "Device driver not
initialized" or some such.

We do have to hold off on stimulant decongestants for the
next six months or so, though, just in case.  Obligingly 
enough, Cordelia
came down with a cold last night.  Fortunately we can still
give her nasal decongestant spray, bar none my favourite
cold remedy, so we did that and soon enough she was sleeping
soundly.
