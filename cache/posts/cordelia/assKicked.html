Let me just say that this pregnancy is kicking my ass.  I was looking
over my pregnancy journal for last time and at week thirty-nine --
<em>thirty-nine</em> -- I was complaining, for the first time, about
leg pain pelvic twinges and having to walk slower.  Until then I had
been just fine.  It was like a
pretend pregnancy; pregnancy-lite.
</p><p>
I have been dealing with that stuff for weeks <em>already</em> this 
time!  If I have been sitting for a long time and then I stand up,
I get this miserable ache in my pelvis, like you get the first time
you go for a long bike ride in spring, except <em>on the inside</em>.  
I can't
walk at faster than an amble without getting these crazy stitches
in my sides.  I can't walk at <em>any</em> pace for more than about
twenty-minutes without taking a bread.
I have to lie at funny angles, or propped up with a
pillow, or else the weight of my belly pulls at my sides in weird ways.
And I had a leg cramp last night that was so bad that I woke Blake
up with my freaking out.
</p><p>
And so tired.  I can sleep and sleep and sleep, and when I wake up, 
all I want to do is sleep some more.  I wish I could have a
day off to just gorge myself on sleep.
</p><p>
So needless to say, I will reiterate <em>two more months</em>?!
I can't imagine whether and how it will get worse.  I have to 
improve my attitude, though, I am spending far too much time feeling
sorry for myself.  It's hard not to, though, between the pregnancy 
and this absurdly hot weather and the bad back thing.  Poor 'ittle 
me.
</p><p>
It's making me realize why the birth rate plummets as soon as a society
starts to educate and emancipate their women.  "You mean I don't 
<em>have</em> to do this?  Hell no!"
