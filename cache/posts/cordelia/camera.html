We have this old Fisher-Price toy camera from the 
seventies — it
was Blake's as a boy — and it's a toy version of the
old 110 cameras, remember them?  It has a flash cube on the
top which rotates 90° every time you take a picture.
(Dave, I think we might have had the same one, I
remember it or something like it.)

So despite this "camera" being completely unlike 
any camera the girls have ever seen, they have
taken to it very well and pretend to take pictures 
all the
time.  "Say 'banana'!"

Cordelia, however, takes
it one step further.  After taking the picture,
she runs up to you, turns the camera around and
shows you the non-existent screen on the back;
"See yer picture!  See yer picture!"
