<p>I posted this as a comment over at <a href="http://www.hollie.us/">Hollie's
blog</a> and thought I should put it here too.</p>
<p>We were at the grocery store today and Blake and Cordelia were 
having conversations on the pretend phone – you know the one 
you make with your little finger and thumb outstretched?</p>
<p>Well, Cordelia called Blake and said, “Is Mummy there?” Actually, 
what she said was “Give it to Mummy”, but she meant “Is Mummy there?”</p>
<p>So Blake held his pretend phone up to my face, and I said, “Hello?”</p>
<p>Cordelia paused, giggled, and said, “Bye!”</p>
<p>That’s right, she prank-called me on the <em>pretend phone</em>.</p>
