<p>Sometimes talking to Cordelia is exhausting because she likes to say
things <em>very thoroughly</em>. So yesterday I was in the shower and she knocked
on the door and said, "C'n I go pee?"</p>
<p>"Sure, as long as you don't flush."</p>
<p>"Okay, mama, I was going to tell you when I was going to flush!"</p>
<p>"Okay, thanks."</p>
<p>"So you can get out of da water!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's right."</p>
<p>"But not out of da shower!"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Just out of da water part of da shower!"</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>"But stay in da shower!"</p>
<p>"Yes. Thank you."</p>
<p>"But go out of da water!"</p>
<p><em>sigh</em> "Right."</p>
