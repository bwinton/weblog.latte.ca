So far I have been pretty much major-symptom-free, apart from the tiredness,
but today I peed about a thousand times, and I was bordering on 
narcoleptic.  Granted I didn't take a nap today, which I have been
able to do a lot lately.  Generally the low level of symptoms is freaking
me out a little bit, because I know that women who don't have 
morning sickness are more likely to miscarry.  Or rather, I suppose,
women who are going to miscarry are less likely to have morning
sickness.  And I'm pretty sure I had morning sickness by this time
in the last pregnancy.  (Actually I just checked my old journal and
apparently I had no symptoms at this point, so never mind.)

Anyway, I asked the midwife whether I was likely to miscarry and she
said it was pretty unlikely given my age and history, so I'm mostly
not worried about it.

Our midwife (not our primary from last time, but our secondary) also
said that with a VBAC you can't induce, which saves me having to decide
if I want to induce if I go post-mature again and need to deliver 
immediately.  If I do go into labour normally I think I will deliver
at hospital due to the (admittedly low) chance of uterine rupture.  
But maybe not, there is still lots of thinking to do about that, and
lots of time to think.
