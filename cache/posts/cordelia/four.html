<p>Cordelia is four! Her birthday was on Sunday, and we celebrated
all day. In the morning, we had two kinds of pancakes (thin and
fat), and then we went out to Word on the Street for some literary
fun. We saw the TVOKids folks (again), got some (more) TVOKids swag,
had lunch (chicken and hot dog), visited the <em>This</em> and <em>Spacing</em>
magazine booths, bought some TTC station buttons from Spacing (Davisville,
Museum, Dupont and Dundas), and listened to stories. Then we
visited Daddy and his geeky friends at U of T. We all rode the
TTC home, and then lots of people came over for Cordelia's
birthday tea.</p>
<p>Instead of having a kid party for Cordelia, I invited family
and friends: Baba and Zaida, Morgan and Erik, Douglas and 
Tanya and Ursa and Otis, Sara and Blair and (more importantly)
Henry and Liam, and Kat. If you do that math you'll see I didn't
do myself any favours; we ended up with thirteen 
people over, but everyone managed to get themselves tea or
coffee or beer, and we didn't run out of cake, so I call that
a win.</p>
<p>For her birthday, Cordelia got a Schylling balloon mobile and
glow in the dark stars to decorate her bedroom, some cool
markers and a sticker book, a book of foam shapes, and Lauren
Child's creepy interpretation of 
<em>Goldilocks and the Three Bears</em>.  Those were all from me (bought with money from my mum. Hooray
Mum!)
She also got a jewellery-making kit and a sticker book from 
Henry, and a very cute
outfit from Kat, but the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance was
a homemade robot outfit from Tanya and Ursa. Cordelia loves
to play robot: "I am a ro-obot!". I will post a picture.</p>

<p>Cordelia isn't as independent as I remember Delphine being at
four.  In fact, she's very needy: she doesn't
like to do things for herself if she thinks there is any
way she can get you to do them, and she often pretends something
is too hard when I know she can manage it.</p>
<p>She's also clingy, but not in a fearful way. She doesn't cry when
we're separated, but she's very happy to see me when we reunite.
She seems to 
prefer my company to anything else. I said to another 
mom today, "No-one loves me as much as Cordelia does." 
I haven't re-read the Four book so I don't know if this
is expected behaviour. As I said, I don't remember it with Delphine,
but then we spent the four months after she turned four together,
so maybe it simply didn't come up.</p>
<hr>
<p>The other day Cordelia and I went to the school to pick Delphine
up after school. Cordelia was very excited to see one of her
classmates, Zoe, in the schoolyard. She ran after Zoe, but
the other girl didn't see her. Cordelia came back to me, disappointed.
"She didn't even see me!" I told her to try again, so she ran up
again, and again Zoe was walking away as Cordelia approached and
so didn't notice her. Once again I encouraged her to try again, so
she ran up to Zoe and planted
herself in front of her with a giant grin, kind of a "Boo!" move.
Zoe just stared at her, and turned away. And my heart cracked.</p>
<p>That's the kind of approach that would work great on a Baba
or Zaida or grown-up friend, so maybe she just needs to figure
out some approaches for people her own age who aren't won over
by extreme cuteness.
We've been (mildly) concerned about Cordelia's social skills 
for a while&mdash;she didn't play with other kids 
much at nursery school, but was
happy playing by herself. I'm not sure (again) what a four-year-old is
expected to manage, socially. I will talk to her teacher about it
in a few weeks after she's had a chance to get to know the kids 
better.</p>

<p>Cordelia is delightful. She is almost always happy (although
sometimes she is very angry), she is agreeable, she is voluble,
she is clever. She likes to make things, arrange things, draw
and colour. She can run very fast. She knows the whole alphabet.
She still says "f" for "th", and "naybe" for "maybe". She likes
silly things: silly noises, silly pictures, silly stories. Cordelia
is a ray of sunshine.</p>
