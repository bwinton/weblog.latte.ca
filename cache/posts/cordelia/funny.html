<p>This post is for those of you who enjoy that particular kind of humour
derived from small children saying entirely inappropriate things in all
innocence. Lucky for us we have a four-year-old, so we have plenty
of that.</p>
<hr>
<p>The other day Blake and the girls and I took the bus to the
Ontario Science Centre. It was a chilly morning so while we waited
for the bus we huddled together, the girls in between Blake
and I, like penguins. Since I don't know what sound penguins make,
I said, "Buck, buck, buck, bgawk!"</p>
<p>With that Cordelia squeezed out of our little cluster and declared
loudly, "I got laid!"</p>
<hr>
<p>The other morning Blake was brushing his teeth, and because we have
small children, he wasn't alone. He has a tongue pierce, and part of
its care and feeding is that you have to brush the stainless steel
balls of the jewellery every day. So, that's what he was doing when
Cordelia asked the obvious question, "Are you brushing your balls?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Yes I am."</p>
<p>"You should tell Mummy!"</p>
<hr>
<p>This one is less inappropriate. The other day my friend Kat and I
watched that "David after dentist" YouTube video for the first 
time&mdash;the one with the kid recovering from anaesthesia and
saying silly things.  Kat works with little kids and I live with
them, and we didn't find the video particularly funny because kids
say peculiar things all the time. </p>
<p>Case in point: Today, after
a full day, then dinner, with her jammies on and her teeth about
to be brushed, Cordelia asked, "Mama, is it morning or bedtime?
I don't know when it is. I forgot!"</p>
<p>So yeah, "Is this real?" doesn't seem all that funny.</p>
