We went to the doctor yesterday for Cordelia's nine month
checkup.  Here are her specs:
</p><p>
Weight: 20 lbs<br />
Height: 29.3 inches<br />
Head Circumference: 18 inches
</p><p>
No shots this time, and I couldn't think of anything to say
to the doctor.  She has reached all the appropriate milestones
and is chugging along nicely.  Hooray!
