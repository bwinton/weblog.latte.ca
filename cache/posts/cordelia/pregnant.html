For the last couple of weeks I've been tired like a pregnant woman,
I've been hungry like a pregnant woman, I've been cranky like a
pregnant woman, and I practically fainted last week, like a pregnant
woman.

What do you know?  I am a pregnant woman.

I don't remember the symptoms kicking in this early last time -- I
wonder if everything happens earlier with a second pregnancy because
your body is travelling familiar territory.

Blake is very excited -- he's been having the baby lust lately.
I am less excited because it's such a long time; summer will be
over before this baby comes.  But I am pleased.
