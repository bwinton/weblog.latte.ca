<p>Today Cordelia read a book! She wanted a second bedtime book, and
I said she could have another book but she had to read it herself.
In the past she has "read" those baby dictionary-type board books with 
a one-to-one word-to-picture ratio. This time she picked a Clifford
easy reader. I stood my ground and got her to read it and she actually read
the whole thing with a combination of all the tools she's
supposed to use: phonics, word recognition, and context. </p>
<p>She kept
saying, "My brain doesn't want to <em>do</em> that!" when I said, "sound
it out" or "that's a popcorn word", but eventually her brain 
stepped up.</p>
<p>(A popcorn word is a word that you recognize on sight, it just 
"pops" into your head. Delphine taught us that terminology.)</p>
