<p>Cordelia is seven and a half months, and she is...</p>
<ul>
<li>Sleeping in her own bed all night.</li>
<li>Eating vegetables, fruit, cereals, milk products, and some meat.</li>
<li>Chewing!  So I can give her little pieces of toast and stuff
    and she doesn't gag.  Hooray!  Table food!</li>
<li>Pulling herself up to standing (and then falling over)...</li>
<li>...but not crawling properly.</li>
<li>Although she does get around pretty well doing the worm.</li>
<li>Still really charming and smiley, but...</li>
<li>...showing some separation anxiety.  Whenever a stranger
   stops to talk to her she gets this slightly worried (but
   friendly) expression and looks at me to make sure everything
   is okay. </li>
<li>19 pounds -- still large for her age, but well-proportioned.</li>
<li>Muscular and strong.</li>
</ul>
