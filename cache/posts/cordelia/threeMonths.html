Cordelia turned three months old on Tuesday, and on Thursday she
rolled over from back to front for the first time.  She worked
really hard at it, starting with her legs and twisting her torso.
She had trouble figuring out what to do with the bottom arm for
a while, but she finally got it, and now she turns over as soon
as you put her down on her back on a flat surface.

The problem is that then she can't get back onto her back,
and she inevitably spits up and then gets really pissed at
having to lie with her face in a puddle of regurgutated
milk, so she protests until you flip her back over.  At which
point she rolls over and starts the whole process again.

Generally she continues to be a really smiley baby.  She
only cries when she has some particular need, and even then
she's quite polite about it.  
</p><p>
The exception to this is evenings,
when she yells vigorously for no apparent reason.  We alternately
rock her, nurse her, change her and set her down until she finally gets
tired of it and falls asleep.  I think once we institute a proper
bedtime early in the evening this problem will be solved (because
she will be sleeping).  I don't know when that will be, though.
Weissbluth says you can start putting your baby to sleep on
a schedule at four months, but I'm not sure when I can expect
her to get through the night without nursing.

I put up some <a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/2005/1208/">pictures</a>
and a couple of videos of Cordelia.  Enjoy!
