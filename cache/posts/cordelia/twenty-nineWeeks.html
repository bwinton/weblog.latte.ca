I can't believe I still have more than two months left.  <em>Two
months</em>.  I am so done.  I am huge and ungainly; my pelvis
hurts half of the time, and I can't walk at faster than an amble
without getting miserable cramps.  Oh, and the varicose veins.
I could have done without them.
</p><p>
In better news, I don't have gestational diabetes, my hemoglobin 
is great, and I'm generally healthy.  I'm now visiting the midwife
every two weeks instead of every month, which certainly makes me
feel like something is starting to happen.  
</p><p>
I had a real moody day yesterday; I felt very anxious and ready
to cry at any moment.  There was no real reason for it, though, and
sure enough I felt better this morning.  It didn't hurt that I got
lots of sleep, and it was sunny and beautiful when I woke up.  And
Sunday!  I love the weekend.  I think I will always love weekends.

There is almost nothing to do before this baby comes, unlike last
time when there was everything to do.  I would like to get a new
dresser from Ikea, one that is the right height to be a changing
table.  (My back is not going to forgive me for another three years
of changing diapers hunched over our bed.)  And we need to pack the
bag for the hospital, but that can wait.  Oh, and we need another
car seat.
</p><p>
Apart from that, well, if he's a boy I will probably
have to get some boyish clothes, but since we need to get him or
her winter clothes anyway (since Delphine's baby stuff is all 
summery) we can just layer the boy sweaters over the effeminate
underthings.
</p><p>
Oh, and I bet we will need a tandem stroller, but I am having
no luck finding a tandem version of the cheap umbrella strollers.
Do they even exist?  I don't want to spend upwards of two hundred
bucks on another stroller, but I thought it would be handy to have
a tandem.

Yesterday we all went up to the suburbs to visit Ellen and Dexter
and their new baby Maxine, who is just a month old.  She is very small --
still two pounds smaller than Delphine was when she was born.  Blake
was a little weirded out by her smallness; he thinks she's too small
to be out.  I, on the other hand, can't imagine something that big
still being in.  It's the paradox of birthing a huge human head
through tiny human hips.
</p><p>
Delphine was pretty stuck by the baby.  After we got home, she was
very emotional, so I asked her if she was sad -- "yeah".  Was she
sad about Maxine?  "Yeah."  Was she said because Mummy and Daddy
spent so much time holding Maxine?  "Yeah."  So I explained to her
that when the new baby comes we will still love her just as much.
Then this morning when we were all in bed, she saw my big belly and
started crying, and we had to do it all again.  I expect we will have
the same conversation a few more times before September, and then some
more after the new baby comes.  I'm glad that Maxine came first to
help Delphine get used to the idea of a baby before having to confront
the reality of one.
