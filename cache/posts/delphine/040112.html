It's been ages since I've updated, and a lot has changed, although
it seems like mostly in the last couple of day.
</p><p>
Delphine's a champion stander now; she easily pulls herself up on
whatever is around, and she will stand and play at a coffee table
or chair for ages.  She's even started experimenting with only 
holding on with one hand, and she  cruises from one piece of
furniture to another.
</p><p>
On the crawling front, though, she hasn't advanced much.  She can
get around pretty quickly, but she's still commando-crawling, and
hasn't discovered the superiority of the hands-and-knees technique.
I'm beginning to wonder if she won't bypass that stage altogether
and skip right to walking.
</p><p>
Much to my relief, she has finally discovered consonants; Friday
she figured out muh-muh-muh-muh, and by Sunday she had added
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba and da-da-da-da-da.  Soon she'll be writing sonnets.
</p><p>
She's eating lots of different foods now; fruits, vegetables, 
cereals, yogurt, cottage cheese and beans.  This week I'm going to 
give her tofu, and then we'll try actual dead animal.  The only 
thing that seems to stop her is chunks; she still likes things
well pureed, or else she has to make dealthy gagging sounds until
I rescue her from the killer peas!  In her mouth!  And then sometimes
she vomits.  I've learned my lesson.
</p><p>
She's cut her nursing way back; she doesn't nurse at all in the morning,
and sometimes we go all afternoon without nursing either.  She
still nurses in the evening and through the night.  The only thing
that settles her when she wakes overnight, in fact, is nursing.  
Sometimes I get tired of being the human pacifier, but it's not 
like she'll be a baby forever.
</p><p>
She's well and truly into the separation anxiety phase, apparently
right on time.  She doesn't even like it when her aunt or grandpa
hold her, and she never used to have a problem with them.  Now,
it's Mum or Dad or nobody.
</p><p>
We went to playgroup for the first time 
last Wednesday; it's a program with music,
games and crafts.  I signed us up as much for an activity for me
as anything.  I need something to break up the weeks or this
winter is going to last for years.  
</p><p>
I was really looking forward
to it, to learning some new songs and meeting other mothers, and
in that respect it was disappointing.  I didn't like some of
the new songs, and the ones she sung that I knew were kind of 
mangled: "hush-a, hush-a" in "Ring Around the Rosies" instead
of "a-tishoo, a-tishoo", and "all around the town" in "The
Wheels on the Bus" instead of "all the livelong day", not that
that makes any sense.  I know they're folk songs, and that's what
they do, change, but it seemed weird and wrong.  I'll get
over it.
</p><p>
The other mothers weren't so friendly; I felt like the new
girl all over again, trying to make eye contact and smile and
be friendly, and everyone seemed to avoid my eyes and close
off into their cliques.  It was quite weird.  I did end up
elbowing my way into a conversation or two, and I'm sure it 
will get better as the weeks go on.

I've decided I'm going to stop worrying about whether I'm
doing things right. I kept second-guessing myself; should
I be feeding Del this, or that?  Should I try and make her
sleep in the crib?  Should I nurse her more?  Less?  Make
her nap longer?  How?  Hold her more often?  Less often?
Read to her?  Make her listen to classical music?  Describe
everything she sees, loudly, like some 
deranged docent?
</p><p>
Finally I realized that I'm a reasonably intelligent and 
emotionally stable and if I follow my instincts and listen
to my heart, I won't go far wrong.  I don't need her to
pass the RCM Grade 12 piano exam by the time she's eight,
or cure cancer or remedy world hunger.  All I want for her
is happiness, and right now that means sleeping with me and
eating bananas and going for walks.
</p><p>
She's pretty smart, too, and I'm sure she'll figure out how
to go to sleep by herself, and how to talk, and how to read,
without me shoving it all down her neck.
