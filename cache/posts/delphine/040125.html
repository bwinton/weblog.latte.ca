On Friday Morgan and I took Delphine swimming at the local community centre
where they have a baby pool, a shallow pool with warm water and 
wide graduated steps.
</p><p>
Delphine did not take to the water like a fish.  She wasn't scared,
but she wasn't willing to give it her whole-hearted commendation 
without further study.  So we sat in the shallows, and she
considered.
</p><p>
If you haven't met Delphine, I should explain now that she is a very
serious little person.  She approaches new situations with gravity
and deliberation, studying her surroundings with big, blue, unblinking
eyes before deciding if she approves.
</p><p>
It took her a good ten or fifteen minutes of thought before she 
concluded that sitting in a large puddle of warm water doesn't
suck.  She learned how to splash herself by pounding on the surface
of the water, never failing to be surprised by the result.
*splash!*  *blink* *blink*  "What happened?  My face is wet."
Then she got her hands on a toy orca and chewed contentedly
on its tail and watched the other children until it was time to 
get out of the pool.  
</p><p>
Altogether I think we sat for at least forty minutes.  While Delphine
studied and considered and decided, Morgan and I watched the other
people.  There was a little boy with red goggles who talked to
everyone, there was a girl in a red flowery suit who was fascinated
with Delphine, there was a mom who constructed an elaborate
Rube Goldbergian fountain out of flutter boards and watering cans.
It was a hoot.  We'll go again.
