I was desperately clicking around The Usual Suspects trying to find
a place to pimp this journal, until I realized, duh, that's what I
have a weblog for.

So, go read <a href="http://www.dooce.com/">Dooce</a>.  She just had
a baby (no, like, two weeks ago) and she's fucking funny and I love her
already.

<blockquote>
But I do need to come to terms with the possibility of some grumpy 
single person shooting me a disapproving look as I bounce a fussy 
baby in one arm while I reach for a gallon of milk with the other 
arm, as if my baby has no business being in a public place. I was 
once that grumpy single person, and I feel her pain, the pain of 
sleeping more than eight hours a night, the pain of eating a warm 
meal with two hands, the pain of chugging two double vodka martinis 
without fear of poisoning another human being. And I want to say to 
the grumpy, single me of several years ago - the grumpy, single me 
who kept up with her eyebrows and had her nails professionally 
manicured every two weeks - I want to say, FUCKING WHORE! And 
then I want to choke her and beat her with a wooden club.
