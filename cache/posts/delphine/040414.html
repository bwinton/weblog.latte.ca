I forgot one more Delphine milestone; this weekend, she put something
<em>in</em> something else!  Until now she has been the Queen of Chaos,
the Renter of Things Asunder, the knocker down of neat piles and 
puller-outer of things from other things.  So this is exciting and new
and heralds days of putting things away and tidying up.
