Delphine is going through changes:  she's gradually 
transforming from an obstinate and contrary two to a 
considerate and obedient three.  She no longer says "No!"
automatically.  She wants to please: when she is misbehaving
and Blake or I am annoyed she asks "Are you
happy?"; the two-year-old 
sometimes wins out, though:  "Are you happy?"  "No, Delphine,
I'm not happy."  "Yes!  You're happy!"
</p><p>
On Thursday she suddenly started asking "Why?", and it's a
favourite conversational gambit now.  It makes a pleasant 
change from "No".

She makes me laugh all the time. The other day as I was getting dressed I put a couple of
breast pads on the bed.  Delphine seized them and trotted
away, saying "I need pads because my boobies are dripping",
and clutched them to her little proto-boobs.  
</p><p>
Sometimes she doesn't like being laughed at, especially
when she's angry.  So she says "Don't laugh!", except
it comes out "Don' yaff!"  Which of course makes me 
yaff all the more.  Poor thing.

We haven't got anywhere with potty training; I was going
to put her in big girl pants this weekend because Blake's
got some time off, but I haven't yet.  It just seems like
a lot of work.  News at 11!  Parenting hard!  I have to get
on with it, though, because Delphine's totally ready.  She
spends ages making her Little People go to the bathroom
in her new Little People house.  All they seem to do is take
turns peeing, complete with pulling down of pants, and wiping
with toilet paper and washing hands.  She declares "I have
to pee" often.  The only thing she doesn't do is actually
use the toilet, and I figure that's only because so far she
hasn't had to.  A couple of accidents might convince her to
figure it out.

Tomorrow.  I swear we will start tomorrow.
