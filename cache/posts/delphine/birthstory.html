<p>The birth story of
<a href="http://mike.reed.org/archives/journal/Sept02/090902.html">Rosalind 
Yates Reed</a> is great.  It was a natural birth, and for a while
there it sounds like it was a real pain in the ass, dragging on
and on.  But the point is that they got through it by trying a
whole lot of different things, and they didn't go for any of the
standard hospital interventions.

I'm having trouble expressing why this story made such an impression
on me.  I guess it's because the labour was long and hard, but they
stuck to their principles and kept trying lots of different things
to move the labour along.  So often I get the message that you can
only have a natural birth if your labour is easy and progresses well.
