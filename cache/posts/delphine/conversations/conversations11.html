Yesterday Delphine and Cordelia and I went out to run some errands.
On the way home Delphine said, "Do you remember the Vikings?  In 
Daddy's movie?"
</p><p>
I didn't remember, but she went on to tell me the story of the 
Vikings, most of which I missed but which ended with "They went
home.  The end."  
</p><p>
Then she decided she was going to be a Viking, so she put on her
imaginary
Viking helmet and charged around happily shouting "Vike!  Vike!
Vike!"
