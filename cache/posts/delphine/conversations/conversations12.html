Blake and I usually tidy up the living room every
night after the girls are in bed, but last night we
were just too tired and couldn't be bothered.

This morning Delphine was appalled when she came
into the living room.

"It's so messy!  It was messy ALL NIGHT!  You guys were supposed
to tidy up!"

I think 4:30 has just officially become "Tidy-Up 
Time".  "You guys" indeed!
