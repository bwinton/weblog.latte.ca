Delphine, being only three and a half, still has lots of those
little kid speech peculiarities which are so adorable that parents
insist on talking about them for years, and even try and teach
them to their grandchildren (ask Blake's father about "meemor" 
and "monsert" some time.  Or don't.)
</p><p>
Delphine's most distinctive one is switching consonant sounds
within words, for example "bastick" for "basket", or "bistick"
for "biscuit".  Our doctor's name is Dr Paquette, and Delphine
calls her "Dr Pateck".  Since she also has trouble with the
word "protect" she decided that Dr Pateck is called that because
she patecks us.

<h4>Delphine Tells A Joke</h4>
<p>
Yesterday Delphine received her first issue of the magazine <em>Chirp</em>,
which is targetted to three- to seven-year-olds.  That's a pretty big
range, so a lot of the magazine is over her head, including the page of
jokes at the end.  I read a couple of riddles to her, but she remained
characteristically stone-faced; however when I read her the knock-knock
joke she laughed.  Encouraged, I read it a couple more times, and then we 
practiced doing it properly, with me taking the lead:
</p><p>
"Knock knock!"<br />
"Who's there?"<br />
"Anita!"<br />
"Anita who?"<br />
"Anita cup of hot chocolate!"<br />
Peals of laughter from Delphine.
</p><p>
So I thought I would get her to go and tell Daddy the joke as a
surprise.  I coached her a little bit, and sent her off.  
</p><p>
Here's
how it went:
"Knock knock!  Who's there?  Daddy!  Daddy who?  Daddy cup of hot
chocolate!"  And she laughed and laughed, and Blake was bewildered.
Still funny, but not in quite the same way.
