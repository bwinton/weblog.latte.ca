Delphine loves to know whether things are real or pretend,
so after a lengthy discussion about ghosts (starting with
"what do ghosts eat?") she changed the subject:
</p>
<p>
"Are dinosaurs real?"
</p>
<p>
"Not any more.  They're all dead."
</p>
<p>
"Why are they all dead?"
</p>
<p>
"Well, that's a good question."  (The lovely thing about
having children is that you can occasionally answer questions
with that <em>without</em> meaning "I don't know.")  I then
took a big breath, about to explain the asteroid theory
(because who doesn't love the idea of a flaming rock flying
at us from space?) when Delphine advanced her own theory.
</p>
<p>
"Maybe they're all dead because people took the bones out
of them to put in museums."
</p>
<p>
Well, I can't say I'd thought of that.
