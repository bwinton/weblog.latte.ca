I gave Delphine and Cordelia each a lollipop after 
lunch today, and wow, was it ever quiet with two 
gobs stopped up with candy!  When Delphine was
halfway through hers, she said, "If I were going
to name this thing I'm eating, I would call it
Lick Sticks.  Because you lick it, and it's a stick.
It doesn't pop, and you don't lolly it!"

She has a future in marketing.
