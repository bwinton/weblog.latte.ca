<p>Delphine (still) asks us why a lot.  Sadly, sometimes I don't have a
good answer, which sort of led to the conversation we had this
afternoon.<br />
<br />
[First scene.  Two cactuses are dancing.]<br />
Delphine: "Why are the cactuses?"<br />
Me: "Well, uh, they just are.  Questions about why a thing is don't really
have answers."<br />
<br />
[Next scene.  A goat has paint on himself.]<br />
Delphine: "Why is he dirty?"<br />
Me: "..."<br />
Delphine: "He's dirty cause he was painting."<br />
</p>
<p>So, I guess some questions about why a thing is something are easy to
answer but some questions about why a thing is something have no good
answer.  Can anyone tell me what the difference between the questions
is, and how to explain it to a three-year-old without using words like
"intrinsic", or "just because"?</p>
