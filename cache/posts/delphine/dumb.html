Blake said I should post something to the weblog, so I
direct your attention to 
<a href="
http://www.tc.gc.ca/roadsafety/childsafe/notiavis/dser/d200204/d200204e-qa.htm#9
">this Government of Canada site</a> about car seats, specifically
the answer to question number nine, "Are there other concerns
in the use of a infant car seat outside a vehicle?"

<blockquote>
Two incidents have been reported where infants in infant car seats were left
unattended on hot stoves, resulting in one death and one infant suffering
serious burns.

Argh.
