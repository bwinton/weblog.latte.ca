Yesterday we took Delphine for her fifteen month checkup.  Everything
was generally fine, but she is not growing as fast as she probably 
should be.  I don't know the exact numbers (Blake?) but I think
she has gained less than a pound since her last checkup at a year,
and at that checkup she hadn't gained enough, either.  It could be
that she's just growing in fits and starts, and this is a slow period,
or it could be that she's really not getting enough of the right things
to eat.  (Or I suppose it could be something more sinister, but that's
unlikely and not worth worrying about at this point.)

I find it hard to get her to eat -- she will have a few mouthfuls of
something and then push it away, and she is fairly selective about what
she eats.  Today I tried Dr Sears's 
<a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/3/T030800.asp#T031200">nibble tray</a> 
method:
I put Cheerios (multi-grain), raspberries, some potato, and frozen peas
into the compartments of a tart tray (like a muffin tin, but shallower).
She actually did eat a fair bit of this morning's selection, and
(surprisingly) not too much of it got ground into the carpet.

She's been miserably sick lately, with some kind of non-respiratory
virus which had her feverish and shaking and puking.  (First puke!)
She hardly ate at all for a few days.  I'm glad we're still nursing 
because that was the only thing she would take -- I couldn't get her to
drink milk or water, or eat anything.  I may never wean her, it's
so convenient.  I think she's better now; she slept all night with
no crying, and the viral rash has gone.

She started walking on Friday; just decided it was time, I guess.  She's
steady on her feet, because she's been practicing for so long.
It's fun and a little thrilling to watch her walking around, as blas&eacute;
as if she has been doing it for weeks.
</p><p>
She doesn't talk yet, at least not in English; sometimes it sounds like
Cantonese, sometimes it sounds like German.  For a week or so she was
calling the cats "Meeaaooow", so it could be that her first word was
in cat.  Hmph.
