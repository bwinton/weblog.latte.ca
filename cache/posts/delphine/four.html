Delphine just had her fourth birthday!  To celebrate, Blake took
the day off work and we had a nice quiet day together.  We all
went to the bike shop and Delphine got herself a new green
bicycle!  It's very pretty and she rides with verve and confidence,
mainly because they have numerous pedalled vehicles at daycare.
She also got a Playmobil house, which seemed exorbitant but I
hope it will amuse her and Cordelia for years to come.  Playmobil
stuff is so cool.

Those were the main presents; in addition to that bounty she got
a puzzle, a Little Red Riding Hood Cape, a bunch of books, some
markers and paints... all kinds of things.  I almost never buy
her any toys apart from at Christmas and birthdays, so she gets
buried under an avalanche of stuff twice a year.

Later on Delphine's big day, Ursa and her mom and new baby 
brother came over, along with Baba and Zaida and Morgan and
Erik.  We all had pizza and cake (yellow cake with pink lemonade
icing) and everyone seemed to have a nice time.  I was torn
between having a big party, which I really didn't want to do,
and just having a family dinner which seemed too small and quiet.
I think the extended family plus Ursa gathering that eventually
 happened (after a whole day of planning) was perfect.

We have taken Delphine out of daycare.  It was a decision after
its time, since daycare was just a big indulgence what with me
not working and all.  I am a little scared of the prospect of
life without "days off"; I got a lot of mileage out of the 
just-Cordelia days, running errands and doing housework.  But 
plenty of people somehow manage to run their households while
raising all their children, so I am sure I will manage it too.
Delphine will quite enjoy it, I think; for the last few weeks
she has been saying she doesn't want to go to daycare, she just
wants to stay home with me.  Be careful what you wish for, child.
I suspect she will be quite happy to go to Kindergarten in the fall.

Delphine and I are reading <em>Ramona the Pest</em>, an actual
novel-type book with chapters and really very few pictures!  It
was recommended in a "Read to your Kids" book I just read, and
I thought I would give it a whirl.  I suspected Delphine would
get sick of it after a page of two without pictures, but she
sits patiently and listens, and wants to carry on to the next
chapter ever night.  I am very excited to read her a book
I remember enjoying myself, a real proper book!
