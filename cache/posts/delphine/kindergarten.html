Delphine is four years and five months old, and she just
started Junior Kindergarten.  She's in a mixed JK/SK class
and she loves it.  When people ask if she likes Kindergarten
she says "Fun!"  That seems to take them by surprise.
</p>
<p>
On the first day of Kindergarten Delphine didn't cry or
cling, she marched right in there with, literally, not
a backward glance.  (I actually had to call her back 
for a kiss.)  I guess all that daycare paid off.
</p>
<p>
When I went to pick her up she said "I have
a new best friend!"  When I asked her name, Delphine
didn't know.  Ah well.  It's now a few weeks later and
she knows the names of everyone in her class.  In fact,
the other day we were at the grocery store when some
little boy in a grocery cart said "Hi Delphine!"  It's
really weird when your kid all of a sudden knows people
you have barely heard of, let alone met.
</p>
<p>
It's taking a while for us to get into the new routine
after a long summer of sloth.  Summer was lovely; we
spent our time in the garden, going to the library,
going to music class, watching the deck being built,
sitting on the deck, generally just kicking around.  Delphine 
had so little to do that she spent her time growing:
altogether she has grown four and a half centimeters since
her birthday.  I was measuring her every two weeks!
</p>

Delphine wants to be a paleontologist.  She is all about dinosaurs
lately; one of the main activities on Thanksgiving was making a
cardboard model of a stegosaurus with Auntie J'Anne.  She knows, well,
plenty of the most popular dinosaurs (your Tyrannosaurus, your
Stegosaurus, your Apatosaurus, your Ankylosaurus, and so on) and the
December 15th re-opening of the dinosaur gallery at the ROM is a
red-letter day in our calendar.  This seems to have ameliorated the
princess thing somewhat, thank heaven.  Now she waffles between
being a fairy princess or being a parasaurolophus for Hallowe'en.

Delphine's getting really good at riding her bike.  Not really riding,
of course, she still has training wheels, but she can keep up a pretty
good clip and she doesn't tend to fall over at <em>every</em> curb.  I
don't let her get much practice because I am a mean and lazy mum and I
don't want to bother with carrying a helmet and locking up the bike
and hanging on to her crossing streets while pushing Cordelia, and
stuff.   But somehow she has still managed to improve, and I harbour
hope that she will magically learn to ride safely without any practice
at all.  Or maybe I will get Blake to take her out.
</p>
<p>
Delphine still loves to be read to.  We just bought a whole
pile of Robert Munsch books which are a hit, plus a few Sam and
Stella books (by Marie Louise Gay) which both Delphine and
Cordelia love.  (I love Scholastic.  They do sell some crap, but
their good deals are great.)  We also plough through some 
incredibly advanced dinosaur books; I don't know how much is
sinking in, but she sits and listens for ages.  Incidentally,
I just got a picture book about the latest dinosaur science;
sort of an "everything you thought you knew about dinosaurs
is wrong!" kind of thing.  I am a little conflicted about
reading it to her; on the one hand I know I love to have the
latest information about things.  On the other hand I know it
takes the wind out of my sails to know that all those pictures
of Apatosaurs with their heads up in the air are wrong.  It's
kind of depressing, like what else in this book is wrong?  But
then that's science; if we wanted certainty we would read her
Bible stories.
</p>
<p>
On that note I am going to go sit on the couch and eat sweet potato
pie.  I love pie.  (But not as much as Delphine!  We were having pie
the other day and she said she loves it more than cake.  The Cake or
Pie war continues.  Don't worry, cake, <em>I</em> will never put you second to
pie.) </p>
