We did two big things yesterday.  First, I bought child tickets for the
TTC.  $0.45 each.  Delphine is two, so she doesn't get on for free any
more.  I have defauded the TTC a couple of times since she turned two
by just putting in a token in the wheelchair turnstile and pushing her through
(I know, I am a VERY BAD PERSON) but this time I figured she would be
taking up an entire seat and we should really pay for it.
</p><p>
And she was taking up an entire seat because for the first time,
we went on a significant
journey (to see Dexter and Ellen -- a subway ride and a bus ride) without
any kind of transportation device.  No stroller, no sling, no carrier,
just me and Miss D.  Mostly I carried her, and she had her own seat on the
train and the bus (which she even sat on most of the time.)  It's like she's
a real actual person!

In other news, this morning we were all cuddled up in bed and Delphine
was singing "Head and shoulders", except she still omits the shoulders.
Anyway, I wasn't wearing anything and she looked at my boobies and said
"Sing it, boobie?"  
</p><p>
(She does this thing where she wants you to sing something
and you have to guess what it is from the one or two words she remembers.
Yesterday she came up with "love you, moon, skinny" and I figured out
it was "Skinnamarinky-dinky-dink", complete with hand gestures.  She must
hear that at daycare because I have never sung it to her.  But I still
remembered the whole thing from watching The Elephant Show when I was a
kid.)
</p><p>
So I couldn't think of any boobie songs (can you?) so I made up a new
version of "Head and Shoulders" with boobies instead of shoulders.  She
liked it quite a lot and made me sing it several times.  I just hope she doesn't
sing it at daycare.
