Blake was reading <em>Madeline's Rescue</em> with Delphine this morning,
and he was letting her fill in the last word of each line.  It went something
like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
"In an old house in Paris that was covered in" ... "vines"<br/>
"Lived twelve little girls in two straight" ... "lines"<br/>
"They left the house at half-past-" ... "nine"<br/>
"In two straight lines in rain or" ... "shine"<br/>
"The smallest one was" ... "dead"
</blockquote>

<p>
(A few pages later is the line "Poor Madeline would now be dead".)

Of course we laughed and laughed, so it's now her favourite party
trick.
