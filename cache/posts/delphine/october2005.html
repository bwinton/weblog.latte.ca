Delphine is almost two and a half.  Today was her first day in the
preschool room at daycare, so she has gone from being one of the
oldest and most senior to being the youngest and not knowing what
the hell is going on.  It will prepare her for many more instances
of the same transition.
</p><p>
It was a little sad dropping her off this morning.  I couldn't
help looking at it from her eyes; the preschool room is bigger
than the toddler room, the furniture is bigger, the other kids
are bigger and louder and there are more of them, and she doesn't 
know anyone.
It was all a little overwhelming and scary and I felt bad
for her.  It's hard not to want to protect her from any scary
situation, even though I know she is going to have to learn to
deal with life sooner or later.
</p><p>
Fortunately some kids she knew from the toddler room who had
graduated earlier showed up, and she got comfortable.  When
we went to pick her up she was sitting in a circle being read
to, which is about her favourite thing.  Also she got 
Hallowe'en goody bags from the toddler room <em>and</em> the
preschool room, because she spent part of the day back in
toddlers as part of the transition process.  Score!

Delphine is taking to Cordelia very well.  She likes to touch
her and kiss her, and when Cordelia cries Delphine likes to
know why, and to help take care of her.  This morning we were
all sitting on the floor reading a book, and I decided to nurse
Cordelia.  As soon as I started Delphine went and got us a pillow,
which is what Blake usually does.

She is a little jealous, especially when the baby gets to go in
the sling or the carrier, but she never takes it out on the baby.
She takes it out on us with the whining!  And the carrying on!
A two-year-old with something to whine about is like a dog with
a bone.
</p><p>
We're starting to work on discipline, which in our case generally
means "getting her to pick stuff up".  She's a great one for 
dropping things on the ground wherever they happened to lose
her interest, and between the baby and my bad back I am not much
inclined to pick up her trail all day.  Unfortunately neither is
she.  I haven't had a great deal of luck getting her to obey me
when I tell her to pick things up, but I am trying to be consistent
and get down to her level and "help" her pick things up and so on.
</p><p>
This seems to be her personal battle; I have been able to institute
other rules, like "give me your jacket when we get home" and 
"don't get down from the table unless you are done eating" pretty
successfully.
</p><p>
What else?  She's really verbal -- she talks in whole sentences
and constructs new words and new phrases using the rules she has
already learned.  It's cool!  I can have conversations with her.
She still refers to herself in the third person interrogative, 
though; she says "are you hungry?" when she is hungry.  I'm not
sure whether to go along with it or to pretend I don't know what
she means and take her literally to force her to use the correct
grammar.  I am leaning towards the former, though; she knows I
know what she means, so it's kind of patronizing to pretend I don't.
And she will figure out how to communicate properly sooner or
later; it's what she's hardwired to do.
