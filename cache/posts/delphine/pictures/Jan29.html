<p>The main tip-off that these are back-dated entries is my inability

<p>The left-hand image is of a flower beside a river.  The blue at the
top of the picture is the sky.  Only having one shade of blue is one
of the limitations you have to work around when using a free drawing
app on an MP3 player.  Less of a limitation when you’re 4.  The
drawing on the right is a flower, and the sun.  Or maybe it’s a
sunflower.  Heh.</p>
