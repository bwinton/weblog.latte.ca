<p>It’s been a while since Delphine has wanted to play on my little
computer at bedtime.  We’ve been too busy reading old, old books about
animals of various kinds.  Yesterday, we both seemed to realize this,
and decided that tonight we would play on the little computer instead
of reading books.  I’m sure Delphine was thinking something more along
the lines of “We’ll play on the little computer, and <i>then</i> read
books”, but that was never going to happen.</p>

<p>The commentary on this is “It’s a head.  On a slide.  With a hat,
and the sun.”</p>
