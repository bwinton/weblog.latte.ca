We signed Delphine up for Kindergarten, to start in fall.
She's actually ready to start tomorrow -- she can dress herself
and write her name and go to the bathroom by herself -- but because 
her birthday is fairly early in the year she will be one of 
the older, more accomplished students in her class.  Fortunately
it's a mixed Junior/Senior Kindergarten class so if necessary
she can mingle with the five-year-olds, although by the time
<em>she</em> gets to SK she will be like Methuselah.

I wonder about
skipping her to first grade a year early; I don't know if they
are keen on skipping grades in the Toronto school board, but
it seems that if you're going to do it, earlier would be
better than later, no?  But just proposing that makes me 
feel like one of those annoying "my kid is so wonderful
and smart and she needs special attention" parents.  But
honestly, if she is ready for grade one after a year of
kindergarten -- and I'm not saying she will be -- doesn't
it make sense to put her in it?
</p><p>
Speaking of people who think their kids are so special,
Dooce (who I normally love) wrote this in her monthly
letter to Leta, with respect to a question on a preschool
application form: "whoever gets to spend their days with 
you will be transformed by the experience, and that the 
only right answer would be: You will not be disappointed."
Seriously?  You know these people, preschool teachers, get
to meet hundreds of little kids, right?  You think your
little precious is going to be the one who transforms them?
Why?  What exactly about your kid is so special?  Is she
the reincarnation of Mother Theresa?  No, she's just 
another snotty, screaming, whining, pooping three-year-old,
just like mine and every other on the planet.
</p><p>
Having said that ("screaming, whining"), Delphine and I
are getting better at communicating with each other. I
read Barbara Coloroso's <em>Kids Are Worth It</em>, and
it really helped me figure out a way to talk to her and
deal with her which lets us both keep our dignity intact.
There's a real art to it, the balance between getting her
to do the things I want her to do without forcing her,
or just letting her do whatever she wants to.  I offer
her choices, compromises, I decide <em>what</em> she does and 
she decides <em>how</em>, but all the while I have to
maintain my authority so that when she's running away 
down the sidewalk I can yell "Stop!" and she will do it
right away.
</p><p>
Delphine loves a power battle &mdash; sometimes it seems
like she automatically defies me on everything: "Toast
for breakfast today!"  "I don't like toast!" (An out
and out lie.)  So then it's fun to offer no resistance:
"Okay, no toast for breakfast, let's have cereal!"  "I
want toast!"  Okay, toast it is, crazy kid.  
</p><p>
My favourite times are when we get to hang out together
without Cordelia.  Cordelia is still at an age where she
butts into whatever we're doing, but she's too young to
play board games or sit nicely and be read to, so when
we're all together I'm often playing interference, but when
it's just Delphine and I we can talk and read and do
things together like real people.  It doesn't happen very
often, though.
