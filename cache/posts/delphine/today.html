Today, Delphine spun around and around to the music of her 30-song 
musical duck, and then she staggered around drunkenly and giggled 
and giggled.

Today, Delphine separated a mandarin orange into segments.  (She tried
to peel it herself but that didn't go so well.)

Today, I cleaned up Delphine's high chair and put it away; she sits
on a booster at the dining table now.

Today Delphine walked across the street to Starbucks with us without 
being carried once.

Every day is like this, full of little big things.
