<p>Last night, as I (Blake) was holding Delphine, and letting her chew on
my finger, I noticed that it hurt a little more than usual.  When I
checked further, I felt the top of her first tooth!  I immediately
passed her to Amy, to double check, and we both agreed that there was
a tiny sharp something there.  I think it was the first time I've
noticed something new about Delphine, and I'm quite excited about it.
Amy claims that she even saw the tooth, but Del refused to let us get
a picture of it (sorry, Mom).  Every time something like this happens,
I realize a little more that she's not going to be the tiny perfect
baby that she currently is for the rest of her life.  She's growing
up, at a rather alarming rate, and I'm very excited to find out who
she'll be at various points.</p>
