<h4>To Santa: I Would Like</h4>
<ul>
<li>a doll</li>
<li>a marble run</li>
<li>a marble [in case they don't ship them with the marble run, I guess]</li>
<li>a fairy dress</li>
<li>a book of poems</li>
<li>a Word Girl chapter book</li>
<li>a deck of cards</li>
<li>an iPod (earphones) [she doesn't like to leave things to chance]</li>
<li>a watch</li>
<li>a mug I can paint</li>
</ul>

<p>I asked her about the iPod (because sad to say, we don't listen
to much music) - she said she wanted to play games.</p>
