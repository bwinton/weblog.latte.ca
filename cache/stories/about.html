<p>Welcome to latte.ca’s blog!</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>Quick introduction.  Blog-o! is a weblog shared by Blake and Amy.  It’s split
up into categories, which used to be listed in a sidebar over on the right
there.  If you click on one of the categories, you’ll only see posts in that
category, so if you only ever want to see what Amy has to say about Delphine,
you could click on the “delphine” link under “amy”, then bookmark that page and
never have to read anything else.</p>
<p>Blog-o! is running on <a href="http://getnikola.com">Nikola</a>, a Python blogging
doo-dad.  For more information about that you’ll have to talk to Blake (it’s
Amy writing here) or click on the graphic over on the right.</p>
