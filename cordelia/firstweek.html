    <h4>Delphine vs. Cordelia: A comparative analysis</h4>

Well, more of a list, really.

<ul>
<li>Cordelia isn't hairy like Delphine was -- she has hair on
     her head, the barest suggestion of eyebrows, and maybe a little
     tiny bit of black fuzz on her ears.  The hair is the same
     as Delphine's, though, straight and black.</li>
 <li>Cordelia's nose and chin are narrower than Delphine's, but
     she has the same eyes (Blake's).</li>
 <li>Cordelia says "Nah"; Delphine said "La".</li>
 <li>Cordelia has narrow, elegant fingernails; Delphine has
     short, square nails like Blake and I.  We think Cordelia's
     come from her Baba.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Baby Mysteries</h4>
<p>
Breast milk: goes in white, comes out yellow.  Where does the
yellow come from?
</p>

<h4>The Story So Far</h4>
<p>
The day after we came home from the hospital was Cordelia's 
third day of life, and the day the midwife came to see
us.  While she was examining Cordelia she heard an arrhythmia.
I know a lot about a lot of medical conditions, but I didn't
know anything about arrhythmias; I didn't know whether it 
was nothing to worry about, or something huge, so I kind of
averaged it out and freaked out averagely.
</p>
<p>
We immediately went to a pediatric cardiologist down the
street (I love this neighbourhood).  She did some tests and
said it was a premature ventricular contraction originating
in a lower chamber of the heart.  The premature contractions
only occurred occasionally, and never two together, which
means it's probably nothing to worry about.  She sent us home
with a 24-hour monitor and instructions to call back in six
weeks -- it was at that point that I pretty much stopped 
freaking out altogether.  She gave me a list of medications that
I shouldn't give Cordelia, mostly cold medicines, but other
than that we can treat her normally, and the arrhythmia will
probably go away on its own.
</p>
<p>
Today (day eight) we took Cordelia to our family doctor for
a retroactive referral to the cardiologist.  The doctor listened
to Cordelia's heart and didn't hear anything abnormal, so it may
have corrected itself already.
</p>
<p>
Apart from that excitement, everything has been very normal so
far.  We had a little problem learning how to nurse (mostly I
had forgotten a few techniques from last time) but now that's
pretty much figured out, and Cordelia is churning out the 
appropriate number of pees and poos every day.  She mostly
slept and ate for the first week, but now she spends a few
minutes at a time awake and alert.  
</p>
<p>
She sleeps for four hour stretches at night.  She sleeps in our
bed, mostly because I am too sore to get up in the middle of the
night.  I'm not sure if we will keep her in our bed once I am
better; it worked really well with Delphine, but I was also really
happy when she moved into her own bed.  We will probably
keep Cordy in with us at least until she is old enough to not need to 
nurse at night.
</p>
<p>
I'm not doing so well.  I had a setback in my recovery yesterday
when my incision started bleeding.  It's not supposed to do that.
I called the midwife and she said I am doing too much, I should
take it easy.  I have been reduced to pretty much invalid status;
all I do is sit and nurse the baby.  Blake tends to me and does
housework.  It's weird and annoying, but I have been reading a lot.
I think I might have gotten better today, if it hadn't been for
the trip down to the doctor.  Hopefully tomorrow I can sit all day
and I will improve more.
