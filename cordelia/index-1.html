Even though there is no actual birth of yet, and I have started working
on the birth story.  It is 
<a href="http://baby.latte.ca/birthstory.html">here</a> (updated on

I am officially done with this pregnancy.  I am full-term, meaning if
the baby was born now that would be cool.  I am also two weeks
from my due date, meaning the baby probably won't be born for ages yet.
I can say with certainty that this baby will be born before the end of
the month, but that is about all I can say.
</p>
<p>
I am very big, though, and very very tired of being pregnant.  I feel
much more weighed down by this pregnancy than I did with Delphine. I
can't move very fast, I can't bend over easily.  I have to reach over
my belly to change Delphine or to turn on the kitchen tap.  The other day
I gave myself a nasty scrape on the belly when I misjudged my size as I
was brushing by the corner of our new dresser.  I am constantly running
into people with it.
</p>
<p>
I hope that I feel as small and nimble after the baby comes as I feel
big and cumbersome now.  That would rock.  
</p>
<p>
I am about out of clothes, too.  I have two pairs of shorts and one
pair of pants that fit and are cool enough for the weather.  To go
with those I have one maternity top.  Until just recently I have been
able to wear some of my longer tops, but now I am too big and
I get a little horizon of belly between my shirt and pants if I try
anything except the maternity top or one of Blake's shirts.  It's a good
thing I don't have anywhere important to be in the next couple of weeks
because I look like a slob.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand when winter comes I will have a huge wardrobe of
many-sized things to choose from, from the last couple of years of 
constantly changing sizes.
</p>
<p>
I asked my midwife if there is anything I can do to encourage my body
to actually go into labour this time around.  She suggested evening
primrose oil.  I am to take a capsule three times a day, and apply one,
ahem, topically (to my cervix) at night.  I don't know if it will make
any difference, but it feels good to be doing something.  
</p>
<p>
I have a pretty
good feeling about having a natural birth this time; this pregnancy
has seemed really... active and it seems like my body is responding more
to the hormones.  I am talking shit, of course, I have no idea whether
I will go into labour this time.  I don't really care either way; it will
be kind of cool to go through labour like a normal person, but on the other
hand having a c-section is sweet because you don't get all stretched out
and incontinent, and you get to miss out on the sweating and vomiting.  
The main reason I want a vaginal birth is so I can come
straight home from the hospital and not have to sleep on their plastic
mattresses and pillows for three days.

Let me just say that this pregnancy is kicking my ass.  I was looking
over my pregnancy journal for last time and at week thirty-nine --
<em>thirty-nine</em> -- I was complaining, for the first time, about
leg pain pelvic twinges and having to walk slower.  Until then I had
been just fine.  It was like a
pretend pregnancy; pregnancy-lite.
</p>
<p>
I have been dealing with that stuff for weeks <em>already</em> this 
time!  If I have been sitting for a long time and then I stand up,
I get this miserable ache in my pelvis, like you get the first time
you go for a long bike ride in spring, except <em>on the inside</em>.  
I can't
walk at faster than an amble without getting these crazy stitches
in my sides.  I can't walk at <em>any</em> pace for more than about
twenty-minutes without taking a bread.
I have to lie at funny angles, or propped up with a
pillow, or else the weight of my belly pulls at my sides in weird ways.
And I had a leg cramp last night that was so bad that I woke Blake
up with my freaking out.
</p>
<p>
And so tired.  I can sleep and sleep and sleep, and when I wake up, 
all I want to do is sleep some more.  I wish I could have a
day off to just gorge myself on sleep.
</p>
<p>
So needless to say, I will reiterate <em>two more months</em>?!
I can't imagine whether and how it will get worse.  I have to 
improve my attitude, though, I am spending far too much time feeling
sorry for myself.  It's hard not to, though, between the pregnancy 
and this absurdly hot weather and the bad back thing.  Poor 'ittle 
me.
</p>
<p>
It's making me realize why the birth rate plummets as soon as a society
starts to educate and emancipate their women.  "You mean I don't 
<em>have</em> to do this?  Hell no!"

I can't believe I still have more than two months left.  <em>Two
months</em>.  I am so done.  I am huge and ungainly; my pelvis
hurts half of the time, and I can't walk at faster than an amble
without getting miserable cramps.  Oh, and the varicose veins.
I could have done without them.
</p>
<p>
In better news, I don't have gestational diabetes, my hemoglobin 
is great, and I'm generally healthy.  I'm now visiting the midwife
every two weeks instead of every month, which certainly makes me
feel like something is starting to happen.  
</p>
<p>
I had a real moody day yesterday; I felt very anxious and ready
to cry at any moment.  There was no real reason for it, though, and
sure enough I felt better this morning.  It didn't hurt that I got
lots of sleep, and it was sunny and beautiful when I woke up.  And
Sunday!  I love the weekend.  I think I will always love weekends.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
There is almost nothing to do before this baby comes, unlike last
time when there was everything to do.  I would like to get a new
dresser from Ikea, one that is the right height to be a changing
table.  (My back is not going to forgive me for another three years
of changing diapers hunched over our bed.)  And we need to pack the
bag for the hospital, but that can wait.  Oh, and we need another
car seat.
</p>
<p>
Apart from that, well, if he's a boy I will probably
have to get some boyish clothes, but since we need to get him or
her winter clothes anyway (since Delphine's baby stuff is all 
summery) we can just layer the boy sweaters over the effeminate
underthings.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and I bet we will need a tandem stroller, but I am having
no luck finding a tandem version of the cheap umbrella strollers.
Do they even exist?  I don't want to spend upwards of two hundred
bucks on another stroller, but I thought it would be handy to have
a tandem.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
Yesterday we all went up to the suburbs to visit Ellen and Dexter
and their new baby Maxine, who is just a month old.  She is very small --
still two pounds smaller than Delphine was when she was born.  Blake
was a little weirded out by her smallness; he thinks she's too small
to be out.  I, on the other hand, can't imagine something that big
still being in.  It's the paradox of birthing a huge human head
through tiny human hips.
</p>
<p>
Delphine was pretty stuck by the baby.  After we got home, she was
very emotional, so I asked her if she was sad -- "yeah".  Was she
sad about Maxine?  "Yeah."  Was she said because Mummy and Daddy
spent so much time holding Maxine?  "Yeah."  So I explained to her
that when the new baby comes we will still love her just as much.
Then this morning when we were all in bed, she saw my big belly and
started crying, and we had to do it all again.  I expect we will have
the same conversation a few more times before September, and then some
more after the new baby comes.  I'm glad that Maxine came first to
help Delphine get used to the idea of a baby before having to confront
the reality of one.

This pregnancy is starting to make its presence felt in some annoying ways,
and some less annoying.
</p>
<p>
On the less annoying side, I seem to have popped in the last week or so.
My belly is all round and sticky-outy, and I have developed that pregnant
woman habit of resting a hand on top of it, like it's my own portable arm
rest.  
</p>
<p>
More annoying are the varicose veins.  (Thanks for the genes, Mum!)
I did some research and apparently
they usually go away after the pregnancy ends, but in the meantime I'm
supposed to put my feet up, and not stand too much, and also not sit too
much, and not cross my legs, and wear support hose (SO not going to happen).
</p>
<p>
None of that sounds so bad, but I'm just about up to here with things I'm
supposed to do or not do and I am pissed off that there's another whole
set to think about.  Although on the other hand it does give me an excuse
to buy the matching ottoman to go with our glider rocker, and then Bogart
it for the rest of this pregnancy.  See?  Silver lining.
</p>
<p>
Most annoying of all is that I am scheduled for a test for gestational
diabetes.  <a href="http://baby.latte.ca/journal/0301/09.html">Last
time</a> I opted to not do the test, but this time we know that I have
had a large baby before, and my mother is diabetic, and I am overweight.
Those last two were true last time too but apparently that midwife was
less concerned about them than the one we have now.  (One of the annoying
things about GD is that there is no standard of care for it in Ontario so
every practitioner does their own thing.)  Soooo, I am doing the
thing with the fasting and the sugary drink and the blood tests for
hours.
</p>
<p>
I'm a little freaked out about it.  I did some reading and GD is kind
of a pain in the ass, what with the no sugar and all.  I really hope
I don't have it, but on the other hand going through this whole process
and even just thinking about it is reminding me that I am at risk for Type II
diabetes and I should watch what I eat and get enough exercise and all
that.  Like Blake says, "GD: Practice Diabetes!"

I'm just over halfway through this pregnancy, and I'm really starting to
feel it.
</p>
<p>
This morning I put on a dress and realized it was a little tight around
the middle.  My first thought was that I should put on something bigger, 
that I didn't want my belly to look too fat... and then I realized it's
not fat, it's baby.  There's a weird shift that has to happen -- I'm so
used to wanting to conceal and camouflage my belly, but when you're
pregnant you don't have to.  Not to mention that in a week or two it will
be completely impossible!
</p>
<p>
I'm definitely showing more than I did at this stage last pregnancy,
I guess because I started this pregnancy some thirty pounds lighter.
It's been weird going through my wardrobe to find things that fit; it's
like going backwards in time through my weight loss.  I just grew out
of the shorts I bought last February.  Fortunately it's getting hotter
and it will soon be little summer dress weather.  I'm pretty sure my existing
little summer dresses will work, and if they don't I bet I can get some
cheap at Old Navy or somewhere.  Real maternity wear!  I never had that
before.  
</p>
<p>
I said above that I'm starting to feel this pregnancy, and I do mean in
the painful way.  I'm having a lot more pelvic and abdominal pain this 
time than did with Delphine.  I get killer cramps in my lower belly whenever
I walk at better than a fast trudge, and I'm feeling more pressure on
my pelvis and cervix than I remember last time.  Also, since the placenta
is posterior this time, I can feel way more kicking, and way earlier,
than I did with Delphine and her anterior placenta.  It feels like the
little guy is practicing capoeira sometimes.  It's nice, though; I like
the kicking.
</p>
<p>
We had our second ultrasound since I last posted, and we were supposed to
find out the gender of baby number two, but no.  He, or she, was positioned
wrong and the technician couldn't tell.  (I'm not sure how the ultrasound
can see through my belly but not through the baby's leg or whatever.)
So we have to pick two names (which we did, but I'm not telling what they
are) and we have to play the pronoun game for the next four months.  I'm
quite disappointed.  As I said to 
<a href="http://www.littleowl.com/thursday/">Beth</a>, I found that knowing
Delphine was a girl really helped me personify her and feel closer to her
when she was <em>in utero</em>.    On the other hand I'm not hung up on
having one gender or the other this time; some days I feel like I would
love another little girl because Delphine is so great, and then other days
I want a little boy because it would be nice to have one of each.
</p>
<p>
Tuesday we have a midwife appointment with our primary midwife.  I think
we will set the date for a planned c-section, ten days or so after my due
date.  I know we won't be inducing with oxytocin, so unless I go into
labour all by myself or with gentler methods of induction, it will be a
c-section.  
</p>
<p>
I'm really torn about the birth thing; on the one hand I would like a 
Caesar because
it's a known evil, and because I am scared of the damage that a vaginal
birth could do to my body, and because a section is safer for the baby.
On the other hand it would be nice to prove to myself that I can deliver
the old-fashioned way -- not that I am tough enough, I know that for sure,
but that my body can generate the right hormones and contract the right
muscles.  My mother never delivered vaginally so I have this weird 
superstitious idea that we, Brown women, just can't do it.  I would like to
disprove that to myself.  We're kind of a genetic dead end, otherwise.

I'm feeling better!  Calloo!  Callay!  I'm still tireder than usual,
but the nausea is gone and I'm actually regaining my interest in food.
Yum!  Food!
</p>
<p>
We had our first ultrasound a couple of weeks ago, to check for signs
of chromosomal abnormalities, and everything was fine.  The baby is the
right size for this stage, and has a nasal bone.  I don't know about that
last part, but apparently it's good.  We got a picture which I will post
in the <a href="http://pics.latte.ca/">Family Snapshots</a> sometime.  
(Well, probably not for a while because the little computer is futzed,
but that's another story.)
</p>
<p>
The thing I'm fascinated about with this baby is how little attention
he (we don't know yet so I'm just going to go with "he") needs.  When
Delphine was <em>in utero</em> I spent so much time thinking about 
her and about being pregnant; practically everything I did was informed
by the knowledge that I was a <em>special glowy pregnant women</em>, all
creating life and stuff.  This time I'm busy with other things
like looking after Delphine, keeping house, buying groceries, being
sick and miserable.  I go for hours at a time without even thinking about
being pregnant.  And yet still he grows inside me, taking what he 
needs without making a fuss about it.  He's not going to be this independent
again until he's, like, eighteen.

I am bone-weary and grumpy and nauseous and I have no appetite.  At least
I know something is going on, but I'd rather it wasn't so much like the
'flu.
</p>
<p>
Also I have crampy feelings, but they're not in my uterus, they
feel more like they're in the tendons which tether the uterus.  I think
of it like a big hot-air balloon with guy-wires holding it to my pelvis --
it's the guy wires which seem to be twingeing.   Weird.

So far I have been pretty much major-symptom-free, apart from the tiredness,
but today I peed about a thousand times, and I was bordering on 
narcoleptic.  Granted I didn't take a nap today, which I have been
able to do a lot lately.  Generally the low level of symptoms is freaking
me out a little bit, because I know that women who don't have 
morning sickness are more likely to miscarry.  Or rather, I suppose,
women who are going to miscarry are less likely to have morning
sickness.  And I'm pretty sure I had morning sickness by this time
in the last pregnancy.  (Actually I just checked my old journal and
apparently I had no symptoms at this point, so never mind.)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I asked the midwife whether I was likely to miscarry and she
said it was pretty unlikely given my age and history, so I'm mostly
not worried about it.
</p>
<p>
Our midwife (not our primary from last time, but our secondary) also
said that with a VBAC you can't induce, which saves me having to decide
if I want to induce if I go post-mature again and need to deliver 
immediately.  If I do go into labour normally I think I will deliver
at hospital due to the (admittedly low) chance of uterine rupture.  
But maybe not, there is still lots of thinking to do about that, and
lots of time to think.

For the last couple of weeks I've been tired like a pregnant woman,
I've been hungry like a pregnant woman, I've been cranky like a
pregnant woman, and I practically fainted last week, like a pregnant
woman.
</p>
<p>
What do you know?  I am a pregnant woman.
</p>
<p>
I don't remember the symptoms kicking in this early last time -- I
wonder if everything happens earlier with a second pregnancy because
your body is travelling familiar territory.
</p>
<p>
Blake is very excited -- he's been having the baby lust lately.
I am less excited because it's such a long time; summer will be
over before this baby comes.  But I am pleased.
