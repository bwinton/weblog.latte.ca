Cordelia has been talking for a while; her
first words were about the same as Delphine's,
"up" and "cat" and "Daddy!"  In the last 
couple of weeks her vocabulary has really 
expanded; "stuck" and "spoon" and "Mimi",
"baby", "milk", "'delia", "book", "more".  
</p>
<p>
She's changed in the last few days.  We
make fun of Blake's parents because
they always say the girls have changed,
every week: "she's changed so much!"  But
this week Cordelia really <em>has</em> 
changed, with
her words, with putting ideas together,
with wanting to be read to;
even her face looks less babyish.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia is very good at putting things
away; she joins in when I'm putting toys
in boxes, she puts books back on the shelf.
She loves lining up cups on coasters; she
loves order.  I think she's going to be the
neat one.
</p>
<p>
I've complained before about how tedious
and high-maintenance babies are, and I'm
not about to stop, at least not until Cordelia
is past the tedious and high-maintenance
stage.  Babies and stairs, particularly,
don't mix; if I were smarter I wouldn't
have moved from a one-floor condo to a
three-floor house until after Cordelia 
could manage stairs.
</p>
<p>
Here is what I have to do if I need to go
to the bathroom when I am with Delphine:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Say "Hey, Delphine, I am going to go
    to the bathroom".</li>
<li>Go upstairs, do my business, and come
    back.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Here is what I have to do if I need to go
to the bathroom when I am with Cordelia:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Find Cordelia.</li>
<li>Pick up Cordelia.</li>
<li>Open baby gate, carry Cordelia upstairs.</li>
<li>Go into bathroom, close door, put 
Cordelia down, do my
business while trying to pursuade Cordelia
to stay out of the trash, leave the toilet
brush alone, and not unravel the entire roll of
paper.</li>
<li>Pick up Cordelia.</li>
<li>Carry Cordelia downstairs.</li>
<li>Lock baby gate.</li>
</ol>
<p>
It's just... ugh.  It's just that little 
babies are so <em>physical</em>!  So 
physically demanding.  And prone
to falling off things.  Cordelia falls
off things all the time; she has fallen
off the step stool, off an upturned Lego
container, off the couch... it's a rare
day, in fact, when she doesn't fall off
something.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, there something nice about
babies.  Cordelia adores us; she is
delighted to see us every morning, she 
comes to us when she is sad or hurt, she
loves to cuddle and kiss and play with
us endlessly.  We are her life, her sun
and moon and stars, in a way
that we just aren't with the infinitely 
more complicated Delphine, who tells me
I am not her friend at least once a week,
who sometimes gives me the silent treatment
when I pick her up from daycare, who argues
about every damn thing just for the sake of
it.  Cordelia is still at the stage where
she is our little dolly, she can safely
be objectified, whereas Delphine is well on
her way to being an actual person, and
like any person, she on occasion objects
to being scooped up and snuggled, she 
sometimes wants to be left alone, she
frequently has desires which conflict with
ours.
</p>
<p>
I'd still rather that than have to carry
her everywhere, though, which is why I am
still looking forward to Cordelia being a
little older and little more physically 
autonomous.  But for now I am enjoying the
unadulterated baby love.

Cordelia is my little monkey.  She is fearless and ambitious —
this morning she was hauling the cat carrier around the house,
dragging it behind her and bashing into every damn thing.  She
dragged it into the kitchen and before I could turn around she had
climbed on it and was messing around on the counter.  She
does appalling things like that every day; I certainly didn't
get any experience with this kind of behaviour from Delphine.
</p>
<p>
Last time I posted about Cordelia, she had just started
walking.  Well, she's been walking for four months now and
she's pretty darn good at it.  Mostly.  The other day I put
her down in  the front yard and she took off like a flash down
the path; there's a little step right before the path meets
the sidewalk, and she stepped down it.  Unfortunately the
step is about four inches, and Cordelia's leg is also about
four inches, and so after her foot made contact with the
ground, her right hand did, then her left, and then... her
head. She hardly cried at all, but I had to pick some grit
out of her, and now she's walking around with a gnarly big
scab on her forehead.  She doesn't care; it makes her
look fierce.
</p>
<p>
She says a few words now: cat, up, milk, ball, book, 
Mimi (which applies to all cats), Daddy, Mummy, duck, 
and of course, "no", with a
little head shake.
She always says "no" when you ask her a question;
I think she just likes shaking her head.  She had her
eye on my tea — the child is always thirsty — and asked 
for it, but then answered her own question by shaking
her head sadly: "no".
</p>
<p>
Fifteen months is the age Delphine was when we started
putting her down to sleep alone; Cordelia has been sleeping
alone for almost a year.  She sleeps from six or six-thirty
until six in the morning, and she goes down without a
fight.  Last night I was nursing her to sleep and she 
stopped nursing and looked around.  I issued my usual
ultimatum: "Boobie or bed!"  Her typical response is
to latch right back on in a hurry, but last night she
said "Bed!", and sat up to be put in the crib.
</p>
<p>
She's down to one nap a day, mostly — she just suddenly
stopped needing a morning nap one day.  The catch is
that when she's sick she still needs two naps some days,
and I'm never sure whether any given day will be a one-napper or
a two-napper.  Makes planning ahead hard.
</p>
<p>
Being in the house with Cordelia is also really hard; if I
want to go upstairs or to the basement, I have to pick her
up; I can't work in the basement with her because there
are too many hazards: cat litter, stairs, unexpected pointy
things.  Upstairs we don't have a baby gate for stairs, so 
I have to pick a room to work in, shut the door, and stay
there.  So mostly we stay on the main floor, which makes
unpacking and doing laundry and any other multifloor
pursuit very difficult.  I do miss having everything on the
same floor, but I have to remind myself that one day
Cordelia will be able to handle stairs and being by herself,
so I will be able to get stuff done much easier.
</p>
<p>
And in the meantime, she makes me laugh every single
day.

Today was Cordelia's birthday.  She's one!  She walks!  She's funny
and awesome and tomorrow we are taking her to the doctor so I will
tell you if she's abnormally tall or whatever.
</p>
<p>
We had a nice day; Blake took the day off, we went out for pastries
this morning, baked a cake, went to the library, went for pastries 
(again), went to look at a house, came home, iced the cake, had a
little tea party with Ursa and her posse and Baba and Zaida, and 
bought the house.  Because isn't that what every little girl wants
on her birthday?  A new house?

Cordelia's walking.  Just a few steps at a time, and she would rather
crawl if she's in a hurry, but she's definitely walking, in her
eleventh month.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise not much is going on (surely that's enough?).  She is
cute and funny and if you make kissy noises while you are holding
her she will dive bomb your face with mouth wide open for a big
sloppy kiss.  She still has two naps a day, although they are
getting shorter and more fitful and I expect she will move to
one nap fairly soon.  She sleeps from six fifteen or so in the
evening until six in the morning. Except for the other day; the
other day she slept until seven and I literally went into her
room to make sure she wasn't dead.  (She wasn't.)
</p>
<p>
And in a couple of weeks we will be having a birthday celebration!  
Mostly I am really excited because it means we can
give her egg; her not eating egg makes it seem like every interesting
food in the world has egg in it.  Pancakes!  Muffins!  Scrambled...
well... egg!
</p>
<p>
She has an uncanny ability to find any unguarded toilet and play with
it.  I am almost tempted to thoroughly clean one of the toilets and
just assign it to her.  
And she just spread the contents of one box of toys over three
rooms-worth of floor.  And I wonder why I have a bad back.  She's
trouble, this one.  But cute.

Cordelia is talking.  She says "Cat".  Okay, she says
"Gah!"  But she says it a lot, when she sees a cat.  "Gah!  Gah gah 
gah!"  And she grins, and claps her hands.  She loves the gahs.
</p>
<p>
She isn't walking yet, but she stands with aplomb, holding things in
her hands, picking them up, putting them down again, drinking from her
sippy cup while holding something in her other hand and not falling
over, all at the same time.
</p>
<p>
She has an excellent sense of humour, with a particular taste for
the absurd; silly hats, funny faces, things where they are not 
supposed to be give her pleasure and result in infectious throaty
chuckles.  She also likes it if you run towards her making silly
noises and then nibble her on the neck.  But then, who doesn't? 
Try it on your boss sometime.
</p>
<p>
She is a bit mischievious; the other day I was on the 
computer while she played and Delphine was napping on the big
bed.  I suddenly noticed that Cordelia was heading into our bedroom
to torment Delphine, so I pushed my chair back and said "uh-uh";
Cordelia immediately squealed with delight and accelerated, her little hands 
slap-slap-slapping on the hardwood.  "Chase me!"  Little monster!
</p>
<p>
She sleeps quite well, provided she is not disturbed.  I put
her down after a short ritual at about 6:30, and she sleeps until
6:00 the next morning, with maybe one or two breaks to howl a
couple of times, then back to sleep.  She's fairly easily woken, so we
have had to move Delphine's bed into the office/living room.
Poor Delphine goes to bed in the big bed and then when we come to
bed we move her into the office; she has been squeezed out of her
own bedroom altogether.  I guess that's the price you pay
for being the one who sleeps well.  It will be nice when they
each have their own room.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia doesn't like to be spoon-fed, so I feed her finger food
as much as I can; toast, crackers, cereal, beans, zucchini,
cooked carrot, fruit.  She gets a fairly good variety, most
of which seems to go on the floor.  But she's still nursing
three or more times a day, so I am not too worried about it.
</p>
<p>
It seems weird that she is almost a year old.  I am glad;
I am looking forward to having two walking, talking, 
going-to-the-bathroom-all-by-themselves kids.  But it still
seems kind of soon, somehow.  This baby is growing up much faster
than  the last one did.

Surely every mother has experience the too-long nap.  
Or is it just me?
You put her down for a nap, you walk away,
she sleeps.  You hurry to get the things done that you can't
do while she's awake.  You answer email, you take out the
trash, you cut up meat and vegetables for dinner.  You 
still have a few minutes to sit down before she wakes up!
You don't brew tea — takes too long.  You make instant
coffee with plenty of sugar and sit down with a 
magazine or a book.  
</p>
<p>
You read a few pages, you look up.  She is still sleeping.
It's been hours.  (Really only an hour and forty minutes.)
She never sleeps this long.  Something is wrong.  She is
surely dead.  You check the clock — yes, it's really been
almost two hours.  She never sleeps this long!
</p>
<p>
What do you do?  She is almost surely fine, and sleeping
this long because she needs to sleep.  Do you check on
her, thereby ruining her nap <em>and</em> your 
much-needed quiet time?  But what if she isn't fine?  
What if she's in trouble?  Stopped breathing?  Choked
on a loose button?  Caught up in a blanket?  Fell out
of the crib and knocked herself out?  What do you do?
</p>
<p>
You decide to let her sleep and try and relax, and 
just as you are getting
to the good bit in your book, she cries.  Your stomach
loosens and you breathe deeper as you go in to lift her
up and hold her close, more beautiful than ever.

Cordelia is going to be nine months old next Tuesday.
She is strong and big, she is charming and funny.
She smiles at people; I will be walking along
with her in the stroller, and someone coming the
other way, someone frowning or lost in thought,
will suddenly start
to smile like they have seen a long-lost friend.
I will start to panic: do I know this person?  Should
I remember their name?  Then I realize they are
been sucked into the vortex of joy that is Cordelia's
smile; it's like they literally can't resist smiling
back.  I hope she always uses her powers for good,
not evil.
</p>
<p>
Just a couple of days ago she gave up the commando crawling
in favour of the traditional hands-and-knees method, which
seems more efficient and doesn't pick up so much dust. 
But crawling, for Cordelia, is just a method of getting
to something she can use to stand up.  She <em>loves</em>
to stand up, against the couch, against the table, 
even against the wall.  She loves the challenge of 
standing up against the glider ottoman, because it
moves; if you wiggle it back and forth when she's
leaning on it she laughs.  She likes to stand up and
hold on with one hand; she will turn and catch your
eye and grin: "look, mum!"  This morning I was holding
just one hand while she stood up, and I let go and she
stayed upright, although it was the momentary
uprightness of, say, a two-by-four balanced on its
end.  I caught her before she toppled, but while 
she stood there she was grinning like mad.  She is
fearless and a bit of a show-off.
</p>
<p>
She is eating almost everything except milk and 
the usual things which are verboten until one 
year (eggs, honey, berries).  She eats soft
table food, like cheese and toast with the crusts
cut off and banana, and would really prefer to 
feed herself than be spoon-fed, which means I have
to remember to prepare things which are tidy enough
to be finger food.  She's patient enough, though,
that I can give her a pile of rice on her tray
and she will pick it up, kernel by kernel, and 
stuff it slowly in.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, her pincer grasp is really good.  She
still has some trouble with losing bits of food
in her fist; if she has some toast or something
clutched in her hand she eats the parts that 
protrude from her grasp, but she doesn't know
yet that she has to open her fist to get at 
what's inside, so she tries to put her whole hand
in her mouth.  Cute; not too smart though.
</p>
<p>
She's sleeping fairly well (if you consider
going to bed at 6:30 and waking up at 5:00 
to be well).  She naps twice during the day,
alone in her crib just like a TV baby.
I think the early wake-up is because we put
her to bed so early, but I'm not sure how to
shift it later without ballsing up our whole
evening; after Cordelia goes to bed we put
Delphine to bed, which usually takes between
half-an-hour and forty-five minutes, and then
we make dinner.  That puts us making dinner
at seven and usually not eating until eight,
which is about as late as I can stand it.  If
we move the girls' bedtime later, I think we
would have to start having dinner with them,
but that would make either our dinner too early or
their bedtime too late, plus I don't relish
the idea of cooking a proper dinner whilst
supervising the girls.  (I usually cobble
together sometime fairly quick (but still
healthy!) for the girls and then make something
more elaborate for Blake and I.)
</p>
<p>
So, whatever, I guess we will just leave it
as it is for now and try and go to bed earlier
ourselves so as to deal better with the five 
o' clock reveille.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
I'm treating Cordelia completely differently
than I treated Delphine.  This morning after we
had breakfast I left her in the living room while
I did
something in the kitchen (there's a window
from the kitchen to the living room, so I wasn't
entirely out of sight) and she hung around doing
her thing; she stood up, she sat back down, she
pulled books off the shelves, she climbed in
amongst the toys and sat smugly in the midst of
all that plenty like a tiny rajah.  
</p>
<p>
I would never have done that with Delphine; the
moment I tried to put her down she would have
started crying and I would have picked her up
again.  She was on my hip constantly 
until she was about
fifteen months old.  
If she did play in the living room, 
I would have been hovering behind her,
spotting her as she stood up and holding my 
breath as she sat down.    
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure, and never will be, how much of
Cordelia's boldness and independence is because 
I'm not hovering over her, and how much I am 
able to not hover because she's so independent.
Similarly I will never know how much of Delphine's
clinginess as a baby was because I never let 
her experience what it was to be alone.  What I do 
know is that Delphine is independent and confident
now, so whatever insecurity she experienced about
being alone, she had the resources to deal with
it when the time came.  
</p>
<p>
I think the difference 
is that Delphine learned to be on her own at
twenty months, and Cordelia has learned to be on
her own at six months, and I expect that doesn't
amount to a hell of a lot of difference in the
long run.

<p>
Inspired variously by the fact that Cordelia isn't growing
as fast as she should, the knowledge that she isn't getting
nearly as much sleep as she needs, and 
<a href="http://www.dooce.com/archives/daily/03_31_2006.html">Dooce's 
post on the topic</a>, 
Blake and I decided to gird our loins and start putting 
Cordelia to sleep in her crib, alone, at appropriate times.
</p>
<p>
We, too, are using <em>Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child</em>
by Dr. Mark Weissbluth; it was what got us through teaching
Delphine to sleep.
The idea is to put Cordelia to sleep, after a nice little
routine, at a good early hour.  Then we just walk away and
let her work it out by herself.  Also, we're supposed to put
her down to sleep in her crib for two naps a day, when she
seems tired.
</p>
<p>
(Incidentally, don't take this as advice, because it probably
won't apply to your child at whatever age she is now.  If
you want advice you should really go read the book, because
I am far from qualified to give advice on this topic.)
</p>
<p>
Last night was the first night. Cordelia didn't have a nap
in the afternoon because she is so abysmal at getting to
sleep; the more tired she gets the more worked up she gets,
and she won't be soothed unless I catch her by surprise
with a nursing.  So after unsuccessfully trying, from two 
in the afternoon until five, to get her to sleep, I decided
I would take advantage of her sleep-deprived state and my
own determination born of frustration, and get on with 
teaching her to sleep in the crib.
</p>
<p>
I changed her into her pyjamas and then nursed her, at which
of course she fell asleep, so I carried her into the bedroom
and put her in the crib.  She immediately detected the fine
layer of hot pins we keep always at the ready in the crib, and
started screaming.  I tried to soothe her by rubbing her 
back, patting her bum, giving her a soother, but she was having
none of it.  Finally I just left her and closed the door
(after the cats decided they didn't want to stay in the 
bedroom listening to that racket, thanks).  She cried from
6:20 until around 7:10, and then again from eight until, 
I don't know, 8:30?  I wasn't really paying attention.
(New <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>.)
</p>
<p>
At that point (well, during an ad break) I broke down crying 
at the idea of leaving her
in the crib overnight; I am not ready to give up (for life!)
the delicious solid warmth of a baby at my side in bed.  
Blake figures that Cordelia is smart enough to deal with
sleeping in the crib from 6:00 until 10:30 and then coming
into bed with us.  (I'm still not sure if it will work but
I really want to try it. I want to have it both ways -- a baby
with a proper bedtime and a baby who co-sleeps.)
</p>
<p>
She started crying again after ten, and since we were going
to bed anyway Blake went and picked her up, and once I was
ready for bed tucked her in with me.
</p>
<p>
Today we screwed up the naps royally; she was tired at
9:00 am, as she should be, but we were in the middle of
bathing Delphine and getting ready to go out for croissants.
We weren't quite ready enough to put her in the stroller
to sleep (she sleeps really well in the stroller, even
if it's just sitting in the living room),
but if we put her in the crib and waited for her to finish
her nap we would have been too late.  So Blake held her,
and she fought sleep for half-an-hour.  She slept on his shoulder
for a few minutes, maybe twenty, then woke up and didn't
fall asleep again.
</p>
<p>
For the afternoon nap, she normally gets tired at 2:00,
but today we all went out to get cat litter and milk at
around 1:00, and she fell asleep in the stroller.  We
were only gone around a half an hour, and she woke up soon
after we got home.  (Naps are supposed to be in the crib,
and at least an hour, according to Weissbluth.)
</p>
<p>
So tonight, again, she was good and tired.  I changed her
into her jammies at around 5:45, gave her a little nurse
(she didn't fall asleep this time) and put her down at
6:00.  Again she screamed frantically, but at 6:09... silence.
Nine minutes!  She awoke at 7:50 but didn't cry for more
than a couple of minutes.  It's almost too easy.
</p>
<p>
I remember this from Delphine, the
weird feeling of emptiness that you get when neither of 
you is holding baby.  You can read, because you don't have
to keep the lights down!  You can play on the computer!  You
can cook!  It's like... why, it's like having no children at
all!  Bedtime is awesome.
</p>
<p>
I have some friends with children Delphine's age whose kids
stay up until their parents go to bed, and I think they 
are INSANE.  
I would easily trade a few nights of screaming, for whole 
evenings of adult time.  Not to mention how badly you are 
screwing you
kid over by depriving them of the hours and hours of sleep
they need, that you don't.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, lest you think I am a completely callous bitch,
I hate the screaming.  It sucks, and like I said
to Blake, I wish I could somehow be with Cordelia to comfort
her, and simultaneously not be with her so she can learn how
to sleep by herself.  But the dangers of leaving your baby
to cry it out are hypothetical, while the dangers of sleep
deprivation are well documented, and this is the best way
of getting my children to get the amount of sleep they need
-- possibly the only way.
Weissbluth actually has a whole section about why he thinks
it's okay to let your baby cry it out, which I found quite
convincing, if hard to remember when the actual crying is
taking place and your blood pressure's up and your boobies
are leaking all over the place.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, so far so good.  As you can see, when we did this
with Delphine Blake actually thought it would be such
a big deal that it would need a whole 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/delphine/sleeping">category</a>
to itself.  You will also see that the category has only
one post; it really turned out to be a non-event, and
she has been a fantastic sleeper ever since.  Here's
hoping the same is true of Cordelia.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
Oh, I'm sure Baba would like me to mention that Cordelia said
her first word: "Baba".  I think Russian grandmothers are
the smartest grandmothers, picking baby's very first consonant
to form their name.

We took Cordelia for her six month checkup.  She had two
shots (Pentacel and Prevnar, I think; I wrote it down) and
was weighed and measured.  She's 17 lbs and one ounce,
27 inches long and has a head circumference of around 17
inches.  Her growth curve is levelling out a little too rapidly
for our doctor's  liking; the same thing happened with 
Delphine, and it only resolved itself when we started
enforcing a proper sleep schedule.  Cordelia's sleep
is appalling and we are going to have to fix it, but
I don't want to think about it.  There will be crying.
</p>
<p>
She still smiles a lot, and has taken to laughing.  You
can make her laugh by tickling her, but she also laughs
if you laugh, or if you make a silly face, or if you
put her on your head like a hat.    And she makes me
laugh, with her silly gummy smile and her noisy babbling.
</p>
<p>
She says "Ba ba bah", and pushes up onto her hands and
knees, and can sit up by herself, although I still like
to lurk nearby when she's sitting
because she's not adept enough to fall over
gracefully, and inevitably smucks her head on the floor.
She's pretty mobile, in a limited kind of way -- she
gets around on her belly, and I'm never sure how much
of the getting around is deliberate and how much is
just incidental to her flailing.
