We have this old Fisher-Price toy camera from the 
seventies — it
was Blake's as a boy — and it's a toy version of the
old 110 cameras, remember them?  It has a flash cube on the
top which rotates 90° every time you take a picture.
(Dave, I think we might have had the same one, I
remember it or something like it.)
</p>
<p>
So despite this "camera" being completely unlike 
any camera the girls have ever seen, they have
taken to it very well and pretend to take pictures 
all the
time.  "Say 'banana'!"  
</p>
<p>
Cordelia, however, takes
it one step further.  After taking the picture,
she runs up to you, turns the camera around and
shows you the non-existent screen on the back;
"See yer picture!  See yer picture!"

Cordelia is so funny and verbal that I think
we almost take the cute things she says for
granted, but I'm going to try and write some
of them down for posterity, and Delphine's
too!
</p>
<p>
Today,
Cordelia had just woken up from her nap and 
she accompanied me into the bathroom while
I peed.  After I finished peeing she said
"You need paper?"  I agreed and she got
me one little piece of toilet paper, crumpled
up into a tiny ball.
</p>
<p>
I looked at it and  said, "I have to get some 
more because my bits are very big."
</p>
<p>
She said, "I like your hairy and big, strong
bits!"
</p>
<p>
"Thank you!"
</p>
<p>
"And also your slippers."

    <p>
Due to various factors, it has come to pass that Cordelia has been 
the subject of a parent-teacher interview several months
before her older sister will be.  I was supposed to meet with 
Cordelia's nursery school teachers back in December, but I barely
had time to breathe let alone sit around talking about my kids
(usually my favourite pastime).  So I finally managed to meet
with Lakeisha and Simone a couple of weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
My original thought was, this is going to be kind of pointless;
Cordelia's two, she plays in water and makes pictures and builds
towers out of blocks.  How much is there going to be to say?  But
as it turns out I am really glad I went because hearing about
how she behaves in school has given me a whole perspective on
Cordelia.
</p>
<p>
Apparently Cordelia is very focussed in class; she will work on
something for ten or fifteen minutes.  If you know anything about
two-year-olds you know how weird that is; usually they do stuff
for a couple of minutes then move on to the next thing.  The "Your
X-Year-Old" series of books has a little overhead diagram of a
room with various activities set up, and then a map of a typical
kid's path through that room, and the map for the two-year-old is
like a bowl of spaghetti.  Not Cordelia.  I saw an example of that
focus in action the other day at supper as she painstakingly shelled
three snow pea pods.  (Ever since we gave them edamame my kids have had
trouble knowing what peas need to be shelled.)  She apparently also
comes back to things; the teachers know to leave her pictures or
whatever out because she'll come back later to work on them.
</p>
<p>
She has only been talking at school since after Christmas; she's been
talking for us for ages, but she held back at school and now they're
astounded at her voice.  Well, mostly the other children.  "She talks!"
But what Lakeisha and Simone actually said — and if you know Cordelia
in person you should make sure you're sitting down right now — is,
"They're surprised when she talks because she's usually so quiet."
Quiet!  Apparently the Cordelia at school is the quiet, studious 
Cordelia.
</p>
<p>
She's also observant; she was the first and only kid to notice a new
science table the day I went to visit, and she examined everything on
it with her (apparently) usual thoroughness.
</p>
<p>
I am really pleased I went to the meeting and was able to hear about
this other side of Cordelia.  I think the problem with having exactly
two kids is that you end up forcing them into false dichotomies:
Delphine is the quiet one, therefore Cordelia must be the loud one;
Delphine is the studious one, therefore Cordelia must be the flippertigibbet.
This was an excellent reminder that it is profoundly important to
step back and see my children for who they really are, not just
who they aren't because that's who their sister is.  Otherwise I risk
missing the most wonderful and interesting parts of them.
</p>
<p>
This has also made me really glad that I put Cordelia in nursery
school, despite the gruelling mess it makes of my day twice a week.
(I'm the mother, what the hell else am I doing anyway?)  It's such
a great opportunity for her to blossom outside of the home and away
from her sister and me.
</p>
<p>
And finally, I am very excited about Delphine's parent-teacher interview.
What surprises has my oldest been hiding?  What will I learn about her?
I can't wait.

Cordelia turned two on Thursday, which was kind of sucky for
her because it was her fourth day of nursery school and so she's
still suffering from lots of separation anxiety.  I felt like
a monster leaving her crying and miserable in the arms of
Lakeisha the teacher on her birthday, but when I waved at her
through the window on the way out she was already smiling a
little bit.  They made up for it by giving her cake because 
it just happened to be the day for their September birthday
celebration.
</p>
<p>
Altogether, counting the nursery school party, Cordelia had
four birthday parties; one last weekend at Baba and Zaida's
with a chocolate cake and presents, one on Thursday night
at home with a plain cake with pink icing and more presents 
— we got her one of those rugs with roads and railways
and stuff printed on it (Delphine's idea), and <em>Hop on 
Pop</em> — and yet another this weekend when we 
made a dinosaur-shaped cake just for the fun of it.  We
like cake, what can I say?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nursery school</strong> is going well.  I signed 
her up not to give myself a break — I think it's
actually created more work for me — but because I thought
it was time she started to have a life of her own, to
gain some independence away from me, and to be exposed
to all the rich and interesting things they offer at 
nursery school.  It seems to be a really good facility;
they always have lots of interesting activities set
up when we get there in the morning, the teachers are
lovely, they have a real music teacher with a guitar
in every other week, and every week they take a picture
of your child and save it in a portfolio that you get
to keep at the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
The only catch is that the school is about one and a
half kilometers from home, around a fifteen minute
walk.  I originally thought it was going to be a longer walk than
that, before I actually tried it, so I was quite pleased.
On Thursday I strapped on my running shoes and put the
girls in the expensive but very cool jogging stroller /
bike trailer and ran up there, which of course also 
took about fifteen minutes because I am that slow and
also running with a stroller sucks.  But it's better 
than running at 7:30 at night when all I want to do is
collapse on the couch.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia can <strong>count to twenty</strong>, which
is kind of odd for a two-year-old.  She loves to count,
but she's not really counting <em>per se</em>.  I think 
she knows about counting in some sense; she knows you
do it when you have a lot of something, and that you 
count for a while and then stop and the number you stop
at means something, but she really doesn't map the 
actual number of things to the words she's saying. She
loves to over-count and usually ends up with "seven" 
of whatever it is.  Also when people ask her how old
she is she says "three!"  She just likes numbers.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, Delphine's friend Ursa also loved 
counting and numbers, to the extent that she still
calls both letters and numbers "numbers". This is
interesting because Delphine used to call numbers
"letters".  Shall we typecast them as the Wordy One
and the Mathy One already?
</p>
<p>
Cordelia <strong>talks in full sentences</strong>, 
and she has reached
that age when she comes out with syntactically perfect
sentences which leave me speechless.   "Help me put
 my sweater on!"  I hear it and it's a perfect sentence,
and then I realize it came from my tiny baby!
 She doesn't do full sentences all the 
time, though. Mostly she's still trying to cobble together
communication with the few words and bits of grammar she knows,
backed up with pointing and when all else fails, shouting
really loud.
</p>
<p>
Communicating is complicated by the fact that she 
<strong>doesn't
know her colours</strong> yet; when Delphine was this age at
least we could figure out what she wanted by saying, "What 
colour is it?"  Cordelia, for whatever reason, can't get
her colours straight.  For a couple of weeks everything
was blue ("bah-loo!") and now things seem to be mostly
red.  If you drill her you can get her to get a colour
right for a few minutes but then if you go back to it
later, she goes back to guessing.  I find this rather
perplexing; she doesn't seem to have trouble learning the
words for anything else.  Either she can't map the colours
to the names, or she can't distinguish the colours for
some reason.  Anyway, you aren't really expected to know
your colours until you're three or even four, so maybe 
there is some mental or visual development yet to come
which will resolve this.  In the meantime all the grandparents
have made it their mission to help her learn colours.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia <strong>sleeps</strong> from about six thirty
until six thirty or seven in the morning.  Well, I put
her to bed at six thirty; usually she stays awake talking
and singing to herself until seven.  She also naps from
one until two or two thirty.  (I got all my sleep advice 
from <em>Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child</em> by
Marc Weissbluth, so if you want a narcoleptic child and
a rich adult-only evening life you should read it too.)
She scared me on Friday by not napping at all; I wondered
if she had decided that since now she's two she doesn't
need a nap.  But then she napped yesterday and today, so
I think I still have a napper.  It's nice because she
naps while Delphine is in kindergarten, so I get some time
to get stuff done in the afternoons.  If I am not too tired
to think; afternoon is not my brightest time.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia has <strong>peed in the potty</strong> exactly twice, both times
under the tutelage of Baba.  I suppose she is more or less
ready to be properly potty-trained, which is exciting in
the sense of no more diapers, but I am not looking forward
to the process, the constant trips to the potty and 
interrogation regarding her need for the same.  "Do you have
to go pee?  Do you have to poo?  Do you want to sit on the
potty?"  However, it has to happen sometime!  The nursery
school teachers say they are happy to help, so maybe I
will rope them in and see if we can get it over with.
That would be awesome.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow is Monday, and October, and I have a million
things to do so I had best get to bed so I am not tired
and grumpy all day.

Cordelia says "free four!" when there is something to be counted.
"Free four babies!"  "Free four cows!"  She also knows six and
eight.  "Free four six eight!"  That's when there are really 
a lot of whatever it is.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia says "Feen" for Delphine, and "Heeya" for Zaida, and
"Dooya" for Cordelia.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia says "haavee" when something is hard, and "ow" when
something hurts.  If I am hurt she says "owwee Mommy"
and then gives me a hug; she's very compassionate for a little
person.  She also likes to hug Delphine when she's sad, especially
after they have had a fight.

    <p>
You may be wondering how Cordelia's sleeping situation is
working out.  Probably not, but I want to write this down
because it's one of those things that parents forget, like
the pain of labour.
</p>
<p>
If you recall, last I posted Cordelia's crib was in our
bedroom, and she wasn't sleeping very well at night.
We had it like that for a while because we were going 
to go on vacation and didn't see the point in trying to
fix anything until we got back.
</p>
<p>
When we were on vacation, Cordelia slept in another 
room and Delphine slept in our room.  Cordelia took
good naps, two a day, and slept in her own bed from
around six in the evening until three in the morning.
When she woke up at three, I brought her into our bed
because I didn't want her crying to bother my parents.
Needless to say we weren't well-rested on our 
holiday.
</p>
<p>
When we got back, we recreated the situation with
Delphine in our room and Cordelia in another room --
Delphine's room, actually -- because that worked
very well.  Delphine sleeps like a log so we don't
wake her up when we come to bed, whereas Cordelia is
a delicate flower when it comes to sleep.
</p>
<p>
So far that has been working perfectly.  I put
Cordelia down at around 5:45 -- the routine is
diaper, pyjamas, brush teeth, nurse (usually to
sleep but sometimes she doesn't fall asleep), 
soother, bed -- I close the door and either 
she sleeps or she cries and then sleeps.  She
doesn't usually cry for more than five minutes,
but you can tell we're second-time parents because
we don't even time it any more.
</p>
<p>
She doesn't seem to wake up overnight, or if 
she does it's for one or two cries, then back
to sleep again.  She wakes up at around 5:45
or 6:00 in the morning.
</p>
<p>
She has two naps, at around 9:00 am and 1:00
pm.  The routine for them is diaper, nurse, 
soother, bed, and again sometimes I put her
down still awake.  Sometimes she cries, sometimes
she doesn't, and she usually sleeps for between
forty-five minutes (bad) and two hours (good).
</p>
<p>
So chalk up another victory for Weissbluth. The
only remaining challenge is figuring out how to
get both girls sleeping in the same room, so we
can have our bedroom back.

Since I started Cordelia on "solid" food at six months,
(instead of four as I did with Delphine) it seems like
she's graduated from starter mush to real, chewable food
really quickly.  
</p>
<p>
Some time in the last couple of weeks she has learned to
chew, and today for supper she had pasta, peas and canned
salmon -- the same thing Delphine and I had for lunch
yesterday.  People food - cool!

Cordelia is just about nineteen months old.  I took her
to the doctor for her eighteen month checkup and she has
gained almost no weight and grown, like, an inch.   I
don't have the exact numbers but really, no-one is all
that interested.
</p>
<p>
She recently uttered her first real sentence: she pointed
to a spot that Morgan had recently vacated and said
"Morgan sat, uh, there."  She says "uh" a lot, and she's
fairly bad with names, including mine.  I was holding her
and looking in the mirror a few weeks ago and I said
"Who's that?"  She said "Baby!"  So I said "Who else?"
"Baba... uh... Mummy!"
</p>
<p>
She's good on her feet; she runs, she climbs, she tries
to keep up with her big sister at the park.  She can almost,
almost, climb downstairs like a normal person.  Except today
she was standing on a step and she overbalanced and came 
headfirst down the stairs.  Fortunately I was standing right
there and caught her, head first, but she's not allowed to
go downstairs by herself any more, unless she goes backwards
which she never does any more because going backwards is
for babies!
</p>
<p>
She likes to walk; every time we try and put her in the
stroller she protests, and she would much rather be out
and walking on the sidewalk, climbing up onto every
ledge and wall, picking up dubious bits of jetsam, wandering
onto people's lawns.  But once she's in the stroller she's
usually cool with that, too.  She's generally a laid 
back little kid, really.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia loves sit at the dining table and colour when Delphine
is there drawing.  She loves stickers even more, but I don't
really have any that are big enough for her to manage.  I
will have to pick some up.  She also tends to draw on the
walls, which Delphine never did, so walking around the house
with writing implements is another thing she is not allowed
to do.
</p>
<p>
She dances!  I was reading a book of nursery rhymes this
morning, and singing the ones which have a tune, and she
got up and danced; "dancing" is just turning around and 
around and then throwing herself at the ground, which
works best for Ring a Ring a Rosie but which she manages
to adapt to a surprising number of songs.
</p>
<p>
What else?  I gave her a haircut a week or so ago; she
was getting a little mulletty in the back while the wispies
at the front were getting in her eyes, so I just generally
hacked at it all around and it came out mainly pixie-ish
with a little of the Franciscan monk around the front.
You'll have to take my word for it, it's pretty cute.  
Delphine didn't like it, though, on the grounds that she
didn't look like Cordelia, and that she looked like a boy.
She seems to have gotten used to it, though.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia is very independent; she wants to put in clothes
by herself, she insists on feeding herself (and in the
manner of her choosing, which is usually with fingers --
did you know hummus is finger food?  Me either.)  She
gets very irate if you try and do things for her.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia is still a lot of fun; she is quick to laugh
and recovers from setbacks quickly.  She's affectionate
and cuddly and generally easy and pleasant to be with.
It's probably also way easier to deal with a second child;
I am fairly sure that nothing I do is going to break
her, so I just let her be most of the time.

Cordelia is almost seventeen months old, and she's a
little bundle of fun.  She's learning lots of new words;
she's at that age where she learns new words every day,
and loves to imitate.  Today it was "snowsuit".  She
started off with "nosnos" and by the end of the day
pretty much had it down perfectly.
</p>
<p>
Lately her favourite word is "here", pronounced 
"heee-yer"; it started off as the word she uses when she
gives you something, but now she mostly uses it when she 
wants something, accompanied by urgent gesticulation.
</p>
<p>
She comes to me when I am on the computer, with
a dolly and a hat, and says "Hat!  Hat!  Hat!" until I put
the hat (usually far too large) on the dolly.  When we're
on the floor, and I'm sitting cross-legged, she 
turns around and reverses onto my lap from about a foot away.
She loves to be read to: "Book!  Book!" is another of her
favourite utterances.
</p>
<p>
She calls both cats "Mimi", and in fact she calls all 
four-legged mammals Mimi, as far as I can tell.
</p>
<p>
She bring boots: if we're going out (or if she would like
us to go out) she goes to the front hall and finds my
boots and brings them to me, one at a time.  "Boot!  Out?"
She loves to go out; the other day we went out and I 
shovelled snow while she played in it.  Because she was
trapped in a snowsuit with thumbless mittens there wasn't
much she could do, but she climbed up and down our step,
and sat down hard in the snow, "plunk", then laughed 
and got up again.  She finds her own fun.
</p>
<p>
When she goes downstairs she goes backwards, and she's
very conservative about it:  she likes
to turn around and start crawling backwards a good two
feel away from the top of the stairs.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia is very demonstrative; several times a day she
comes up to me, unbidden, and hugs me around the knees.
She loves to give kisses and hugs around the neck, too.
She laughs a lot, and if she falls you can often get her
to laugh instead of cry.
</p>
<p>
She still sleeps really well, from around six-thirty
until around six am.  She has taken, recently, to waking
up and crying around ten or ten-thirty, but Blake loves
it because he can go in and have a cuddle with her before
putting her down again.  I suppose that's a bad habit to
encourage, but I doubt she will keep it up forever.  And
honestly, if she's fifteen and she still wants a few minutes
of attention from her parents at ten-thirty at night I
will count myself lucky.
</p>
<p>
She's still nursing, in the morning and before her nap
and at bedtime, and sometimes during the day if she's 
hurt herself and needs comfort.  It's lovely.  She also
more or less feeds herself at table; we bought a 
<a href="http://www.hipposmile.com/ourproducts.php">cheap
Canadian knockoff of the overpriced Tripp-Trapp chair</a>
for each girl and Cordelia <em>loves</em> to be at table
instead of behind everyone in the high chair.  She makes a
colossal mess but she has a nice time.
</p>
<p>
She's good company; she is easy-going and quick to laugh
and to learn. I can leave her to her own devices 
during the day and she'll play by herself for ages.  She
plays with dollies, she climbs onto things, she pulls stuff
out of boxes at an astonishing rate.  She plays nicely with
Delphine too, or I should say Delphine plays nicely with her.
They are so different and so delightful; I could not have
picked out better children from a Children Catalogue.
