<p>Cordelia, as you know, has been having trouble saying 
goodbye to me when I drop her off at day camp this week.
This morning, again, she cried at breakfast, saying 
she didn't want to go to camp, she wanted to stay with
me. We agreed that I would read her a book at camp
before I left her.</p>
<p>So indeed, we sat down and read a book together at
camp. After the book was over, Cordelia looked at
me and asked, "What now?" She was on the very edge of
tears. I said, "Now we say goodbye and I go home and
you have a nice day at camp." Well, I have never seen
someone so small try so hard not to cry. She squeezed
up her face and said "Okay mama" with a voice full of
tears, but she didn't cry. She was so brave, it just
about broke my heart, and it was all I could do not to
cry myself.</p>
<p>The thing of it is, I know just how she feels. (I almost
always know just how my children feel.) She loves
me <em>so much</em> right now, and wants to be near me all the 
time, so it's almost a physical ache when she isn't (at
least unless she's distracted by something else). So 
I will pick them up early tonight and we can all be
together again.</p>

<p>...although she doesn't like the idea. On Friday, when I told
her it was her three-and-a-halfth birthday, she said she was
too little, and also that her next birthday was going to be four!
I was going to bake her a cake, but clearly she wasn't interested
in the half-birthday thing, so I let it go.</p>
<p>She's grown about a mile since last I checked.  I took her into
the school this afternoon when I went in to help Delphine's class put
their jackets on, and I noticed Cordelia is taller than some of
the JKs. I know that's not unusual, but Delphine's always been
so relentlessly 50th percentile in terms of size (once she got
over being a mondo baby, that is), I find it weird to have a
taller-than-average child.  She's gaining on Delphine alarmingly - 
her 3-and-a-half height is only a centimeter or so short of 
Delphine's four height! I wonder how they will end up.</p>
<p>I would say Cordelia has come out of her shell, except anyone
who knows her knows she was never in a shell. But just lately 
she has become even more voluble, more dramatic, more funny,
more opinionated. She's also getting a little 3-and-a-halfish
in the sense that she is provoking power struggles about
stupid things, and over-reacting to things to see how far
that will get her. She's psycho, basically, at least some
of the time. We try to roll with it and not let her faze us
or throw off the whole day.</p>
<p>Cordelia spends a lot of time with Delphine. Yes, they fight
a lot but not all of the time. Delphine reads to her - they 
particularly like Chirp magazines - and... well, I'm not
sure what they do together. This afternoon they spent a good
hour out in the backyard, digging holes with sticks and watering
things which don't need water (like the deck). At one point
Delphine came inside to retrieve matzo, jam and almonds for a 
delectable picnic. It was lovely. For some reason they don't
seem to fight when they're outside. Maybe the house depresses
them as it does me.</p>
<p>Cordelia's all signed up for kindergarten in the fall.  I signed
her up for mornings because she's still napping at least 
five days out of seven. We still don't know whose class she'll
be in. I'm getting to know which are the better kindergarten teachers,
though, so this time I actually care whose class she's in. Hopefully
someone good. (You're not allowed to ask for a particular teacher, 
so if you do they put you in someone else's class on principle. Boo.)</p>
<p>Cordelia can sing! She sings herself to sleep most nights, and a few
weeks ago I was listening to her sing her usual autolullabye, the
ABC song.  She sang, "A B C... A B C... A B C D E F G" - the first
two times she sang it, she sang it on "do do fa". She didn't continue
until she had gotten it right: "do do so". Not only can she sing
in tune but she knows she can sing in tune! Obviously I am now
planning her career as an opera singer - she is very loud.</p>
<p>What else? We are all scheduled to the hilt with summer activities.
Well, more scheduled than last year (ie, we have some plans).  We
have three weeks off at the start of summer, then Delphine is going
to a day camp at a farm in the city.  After that the girls and
I are going to Sask for two weeks, and as soon as we get back
the girls are off to the cottage with Baba and Zaida. (Not sure
if I'm invited or not.) Once they get back, they are both signed
up for a day camp at Cordelia's nursery school. It will be the
first time Cordelia's done all-day anything, and it will be the
first time I have ever had all-day off for five days in a row.
(Except when I was in Sask by myself last September.)</p>
<p>So lots of firsts these days. I realized the other day that I
have no qualms whatsoever about taking the girls downtown on the
bus and subway alone - before, I would always be more comfortable 
if I had another grown-up, but now Delphine can be trusted to
be sensible, and Cordelia responds to verbal commands (sit! stay!)
so I know I don't have to be hanging on to one of them while
praying the other one doesn't do something stupid. It's like they're
real people! Halleluia!</p>

<p>Cordelia is a pretty compassionate kid.  She always wants
you to feel good; one of her most common phrases is,
"Don't worry!"  She's always doling out hugs, and kisses.</p>
<p>Sometimes the love goes to far, though.  On the way home
from taking Delphine to schol, Cordelia picked up a big 
ol' hunk of dirty snow, big enough that she needed two
arms to carry it.  I said, "What are you gonna do with
that big dirty hunk of snow?"</p>
<p>"I'm gonna throw it!"</p>
<p>"Who are you going to throw it at?"</p>
<p>"No-one!"  You can see who has the sense in this family.</p>
<p>"No, it's not nice to throw things at people.  So what
are you going to throw it at?"</p>
<p>"The ground!"  She stopped, planted herself firmly and
threw the chunk of snow down where it broke into a big
chunk, some smaller chunks and some slush.</p>
<p>"Are you going to take a piece?"</p>
<p>"Yeah!"  She picked out one of the smaller pieces and off
we went.  As we walked she was talking to herself, constructing
some kind of narrative for this piece of snow; she's big
on anthropomorphising.  I wasn't really paying attention
so I didn't catch the details.</p>
<p>After a block she said, "The snowball is lonely!  He wants
his daddy!  Can we go back and put him with his daddy?"</p>
<p>"Um, no, let's take him home and leave him on the porch
while you take a nap,
and we can take him to his Daddy when we pick up Delphine."</p>
<p>Satisfied with that, we walked on, and she kept on talking.
Half a block later: "Can he come with me while I nap?"</p>
<p>"No, he would melt.  Remember Peter brought his snowball 
inside and then it wasn't there?  His jacket was just wet?"
Appealing to literature sometimes helps.</p>
<p>"But he will be lonely!" </p>
<p>"But he will just melt into water if you bring him
inside.  I think he'll be okay on the porch."</p>
<p>We rounded the corner and crossed the street onto our block.
I walked a few paces ahead of Cordelia, and then turned around to
see how she was doing.  The snow was no longer in her hand.
"I dropped him!  Now he will never go back to his Daddy!
He's gonna be lonely!  He wants his Daddy and his brothers
and sisters!"</p>
<p>And she wept, heartbroken, all the way home over the sad 
fate of this little chunk of dirty snow.  I had to carry 
her and commiserate.  Poor thing.</p>

<p>This morning Delphine was reading Cordelia one of those 
"Baby Genius" alphabet books with the questions that are
supposed to help you talk to you kid about the picture,
because they assume you're not capable of having a
conversation with your child about a picture in a
book.</p>
<p>So they were on "I", and Cordelia's job was to locate the
"ice skates".  Last time we read the book she only
found the skaters, so Delphine was very pleased when,
this time, she successfully identified the ice skates.  She 
shouted across the room, "Mumma, she found the ice skates this
time!  Last time she only found the skaters!"</p>
<p>Cordelia grinned, bounced up and down on the couch and shouted, "I'm 
smarter than usual!"</p>
<p>I need that on a t-shirt.</p>

<p>Cordelia is three!  She has been three for almost two weeks now!
We didn't have a big party or anything, because she doesn't
really have any friends yet, and also I couldn't be bothered.
I asked her what kind of cake she wanted and she said "a
tomato cake!"  Apparently there is such a thing, but I didn't
feel up to that kind of experimental weirdness, so I asked
her (on a different occasion) whether she would like a
chocolate cake or a white one.  (This is how you get little
kids to do what you want, you trick them and then you
paint them into a corner.)  She said she wanted a white cake
with chocolate icing (this is how they get what <em>they</em> want).
And since she had been talking about having a tomato birthday
for months, I drew three juicy tomatoes on top of the
cake in red icing.  That seemed to satisfy her.</p>
<p>We didn't have a party, as I mentioned, but a few people
did end up coming over for cake: Baba and Zaida were there,
and Tanya and Douglas and Ursa and Otis came too.</p>
<p>Cordelia's choice for her special birthday dinner was sushi,
so Zaida kindly brought over a platter of sushi from our 
favourite place.  Extra kindly, because his car wouldn't
start!  He walked it halfway over to our place and
Blake met him and brought it the rest of the way.  What 
these men wouldn't do for their little girls.</p>
<p>Cordelia really seems to have bought into this three thing.
Her new favourite word is "why", in that reflexive way 
little kids ask when they're trying to get as much information
into their little brains as possible.  She has stopped 
fighting so much with Delphine, and is generally more
easy-going lately.  We don't lock horns so much over
silly things like which way her toast is sliced.</p>
<p>Her latest favourite book is a counting book called
"Ten Black Dots" by Donald Crews.  We've read it at every
nap and bedtime for the last week.  She likes to point 
at the dots and count them, which she now does perfectly,
even down to pointing to each dot exactly once.  She 
can also do rudimentary math in her head, adding or
subtracting one or two.  I said rudimentary!  Generally 
she seems more numerically-oriented than Delphine was
at her age.</p>
<p>She's also really big!  Actually she's right on the 50th
percentile, but dammit, she seems big to me.  I'm still
coming to terms with the fact that my baby days are behind
me.  I know that means that also behind me are spit-up and
leaky boobs and diapers and baby gates and food allergy
scares and chokable object embargoes, and ahead of me are
piano lessons and baking together and interesting conversations
and going for walks and joking and reading and doing crossword
puzzles.  But I've been a baby-mummy for five years; it was
such a huge part of my life â€” it was my whole life! â€” for
such a long time and yet it's already over.  How can that be?</p>

On Friday, Cordelia (who is two and eight months) decided she 
was done wearing diapers and wanted to wear underwear.  She has
decided to wear underwear before with mixed results, but 
this time she was really adamant about not wearing diapers,
not even pull-ups.  So she wore underwear, I accompanied her
to the bathroom after meals and her nap, and she went the 
whole day without an accident.  Saturday she had three
accidents but mostly because we weren't on the ball with
taking her to the bathroom at regular intervals.  
Notably, after her first accident, Blake (who didn't
yet understand the depth of her determination to 
wear underwear) tried to put her in a diaper and she
was mortified!  She was furious and miserable until I
explained to her that she could wear underwear and
everyone has accidents.  Since Saturday she hasn't had
any accidents.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, in Saturday we sold her crib, the one
the people at work bought for Delphine, and now Cordelia
is sleeping in the toddler bed.  She is big!  She 
will get really mad if you call her "little".
</p>
<p>
So that's it, I don't have any babies any more.
