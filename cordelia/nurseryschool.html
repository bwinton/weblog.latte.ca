Due to various factors, it has come to pass that Cordelia has been 
the subject of a parent-teacher interview several months
before her older sister will be.  I was supposed to meet with 
Cordelia's nursery school teachers back in December, but I barely
had time to breathe let alone sit around talking about my kids
(usually my favourite pastime).  So I finally managed to meet
with Lakeisha and Simone a couple of weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
My original thought was, this is going to be kind of pointless;
Cordelia's two, she plays in water and makes pictures and builds
towers out of blocks.  How much is there going to be to say?  But
as it turns out I am really glad I went because hearing about
how she behaves in school has given me a whole perspective on
Cordelia.
</p>
<p>
Apparently Cordelia is very focussed in class; she will work on
something for ten or fifteen minutes.  If you know anything about
two-year-olds you know how weird that is; usually they do stuff
for a couple of minutes then move on to the next thing.  The "Your
X-Year-Old" series of books has a little overhead diagram of a
room with various activities set up, and then a map of a typical
kid's path through that room, and the map for the two-year-old is
like a bowl of spaghetti.  Not Cordelia.  I saw an example of that
focus in action the other day at supper as she painstakingly shelled
three snow pea pods.  (Ever since we gave them edamame my kids have had
trouble knowing what peas need to be shelled.)  She apparently also
comes back to things; the teachers know to leave her pictures or
whatever out because she'll come back later to work on them.
</p>
<p>
She has only been talking at school since after Christmas; she's been
talking for us for ages, but she held back at school and now they're
astounded at her voice.  Well, mostly the other children.  "She talks!"
But what Lakeisha and Simone actually said — and if you know Cordelia
in person you should make sure you're sitting down right now — is,
"They're surprised when she talks because she's usually so quiet."
Quiet!  Apparently the Cordelia at school is the quiet, studious 
Cordelia.
</p>
<p>
She's also observant; she was the first and only kid to notice a new
science table the day I went to visit, and she examined everything on
it with her (apparently) usual thoroughness.
</p>
<p>
I am really pleased I went to the meeting and was able to hear about
this other side of Cordelia.  I think the problem with having exactly
two kids is that you end up forcing them into false dichotomies:
Delphine is the quiet one, therefore Cordelia must be the loud one;
Delphine is the studious one, therefore Cordelia must be the flippertigibbet.
This was an excellent reminder that it is profoundly important to
step back and see my children for who they really are, not just
who they aren't because that's who their sister is.  Otherwise I risk
missing the most wonderful and interesting parts of them.
</p>
<p>
This has also made me really glad that I put Cordelia in nursery
school, despite the gruelling mess it makes of my day twice a week.
(I'm the mother, what the hell else am I doing anyway?)  It's such
a great opportunity for her to blossom outside of the home and away
from her sister and me.
</p>
<p>
And finally, I am very excited about Delphine's parent-teacher interview.
What surprises has my oldest been hiding?  What will I learn about her?
I can't wait.
