    <p>
Cordelia is almost seventeen months old, and she's a
little bundle of fun.  She's learning lots of new words;
she's at that age where she learns new words every day,
and loves to imitate.  Today it was "snowsuit".  She
started off with "nosnos" and by the end of the day
pretty much had it down perfectly.
</p>
<p>
Lately her favourite word is "here", pronounced 
"heee-yer"; it started off as the word she uses when she
gives you something, but now she mostly uses it when she 
wants something, accompanied by urgent gesticulation.
</p>
<p>
She comes to me when I am on the computer, with
a dolly and a hat, and says "Hat!  Hat!  Hat!" until I put
the hat (usually far too large) on the dolly.  When we're
on the floor, and I'm sitting cross-legged, she 
turns around and reverses onto my lap from about a foot away.
She loves to be read to: "Book!  Book!" is another of her
favourite utterances.
</p>
<p>
She calls both cats "Mimi", and in fact she calls all 
four-legged mammals Mimi, as far as I can tell.
</p>
<p>
She bring boots: if we're going out (or if she would like
us to go out) she goes to the front hall and finds my
boots and brings them to me, one at a time.  "Boot!  Out?"
She loves to go out; the other day we went out and I 
shovelled snow while she played in it.  Because she was
trapped in a snowsuit with thumbless mittens there wasn't
much she could do, but she climbed up and down our step,
and sat down hard in the snow, "plunk", then laughed 
and got up again.  She finds her own fun.
</p>
<p>
When she goes downstairs she goes backwards, and she's
very conservative about it:  she likes
to turn around and start crawling backwards a good two
feel away from the top of the stairs.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia is very demonstrative; several times a day she
comes up to me, unbidden, and hugs me around the knees.
She loves to give kisses and hugs around the neck, too.
She laughs a lot, and if she falls you can often get her
to laugh instead of cry.
</p>
<p>
She still sleeps really well, from around six-thirty
until around six am.  She has taken, recently, to waking
up and crying around ten or ten-thirty, but Blake loves
it because he can go in and have a cuddle with her before
putting her down again.  I suppose that's a bad habit to
encourage, but I doubt she will keep it up forever.  And
honestly, if she's fifteen and she still wants a few minutes
of attention from her parents at ten-thirty at night I
will count myself lucky.
</p>
<p>
She's still nursing, in the morning and before her nap
and at bedtime, and sometimes during the day if she's 
hurt herself and needs comfort.  It's lovely.  She also
more or less feeds herself at table; we bought a 
<a href="http://www.hipposmile.com/ourproducts.php">cheap
Canadian knockoff of the overpriced Tripp-Trapp chair</a>
for each girl and Cordelia <em>loves</em> to be at table
instead of behind everyone in the high chair.  She makes a
colossal mess but she has a nice time.
</p>
<p>
She's good company; she is easy-going and quick to laugh
and to learn. I can leave her to her own devices 
during the day and she'll play by herself for ages.  She
plays with dollies, she climbs onto things, she pulls stuff
out of boxes at an astonishing rate.  She plays nicely with
Delphine too, or I should say Delphine plays nicely with her.
They are so different and so delightful; I could not have
picked out better children from a Children Catalogue.
