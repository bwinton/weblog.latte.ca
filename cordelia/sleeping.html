Inspired variously by the fact that Cordelia isn't growing
as fast as she should, the knowledge that she isn't getting
nearly as much sleep as she needs, and 
<a href="http://www.dooce.com/archives/daily/03_31_2006.html">Dooce's 
post on the topic</a>, 
Blake and I decided to gird our loins and start putting 
Cordelia to sleep in her crib, alone, at appropriate times.
</p>
<p>
We, too, are using <em>Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child</em>
by Dr. Mark Weissbluth; it was what got us through teaching
Delphine to sleep.
The idea is to put Cordelia to sleep, after a nice little
routine, at a good early hour.  Then we just walk away and
let her work it out by herself.  Also, we're supposed to put
her down to sleep in her crib for two naps a day, when she
seems tired.
</p>
<p>
(Incidentally, don't take this as advice, because it probably
won't apply to your child at whatever age she is now.  If
you want advice you should really go read the book, because
I am far from qualified to give advice on this topic.)
</p>
<p>
Last night was the first night. Cordelia didn't have a nap
in the afternoon because she is so abysmal at getting to
sleep; the more tired she gets the more worked up she gets,
and she won't be soothed unless I catch her by surprise
with a nursing.  So after unsuccessfully trying, from two 
in the afternoon until five, to get her to sleep, I decided
I would take advantage of her sleep-deprived state and my
own determination born of frustration, and get on with 
teaching her to sleep in the crib.
</p>
<p>
I changed her into her pyjamas and then nursed her, at which
of course she fell asleep, so I carried her into the bedroom
and put her in the crib.  She immediately detected the fine
layer of hot pins we keep always at the ready in the crib, and
started screaming.  I tried to soothe her by rubbing her 
back, patting her bum, giving her a soother, but she was having
none of it.  Finally I just left her and closed the door
(after the cats decided they didn't want to stay in the 
bedroom listening to that racket, thanks).  She cried from
6:20 until around 7:10, and then again from eight until, 
I don't know, 8:30?  I wasn't really paying attention.
(New <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>.)
</p>
<p>
At that point (well, during an ad break) I broke down crying 
at the idea of leaving her
in the crib overnight; I am not ready to give up (for life!)
the delicious solid warmth of a baby at my side in bed.  
Blake figures that Cordelia is smart enough to deal with
sleeping in the crib from 6:00 until 10:30 and then coming
into bed with us.  (I'm still not sure if it will work but
I really want to try it. I want to have it both ways -- a baby
with a proper bedtime and a baby who co-sleeps.)
</p>
<p>
She started crying again after ten, and since we were going
to bed anyway Blake went and picked her up, and once I was
ready for bed tucked her in with me.
</p>
<p>
Today we screwed up the naps royally; she was tired at
9:00 am, as she should be, but we were in the middle of
bathing Delphine and getting ready to go out for croissants.
We weren't quite ready enough to put her in the stroller
to sleep (she sleeps really well in the stroller, even
if it's just sitting in the living room),
but if we put her in the crib and waited for her to finish
her nap we would have been too late.  So Blake held her,
and she fought sleep for half-an-hour.  She slept on his shoulder
for a few minutes, maybe twenty, then woke up and didn't
fall asleep again.
</p>
<p>
For the afternoon nap, she normally gets tired at 2:00,
but today we all went out to get cat litter and milk at
around 1:00, and she fell asleep in the stroller.  We
were only gone around a half an hour, and she woke up soon
after we got home.  (Naps are supposed to be in the crib,
and at least an hour, according to Weissbluth.)
</p>
<p>
So tonight, again, she was good and tired.  I changed her
into her jammies at around 5:45, gave her a little nurse
(she didn't fall asleep this time) and put her down at
6:00.  Again she screamed frantically, but at 6:09... silence.
Nine minutes!  She awoke at 7:50 but didn't cry for more
than a couple of minutes.  It's almost too easy.
</p>
<p>
I remember this from Delphine, the
weird feeling of emptiness that you get when neither of 
you is holding baby.  You can read, because you don't have
to keep the lights down!  You can play on the computer!  You
can cook!  It's like... why, it's like having no children at
all!  Bedtime is awesome.
</p>
<p>
I have some friends with children Delphine's age whose kids
stay up until their parents go to bed, and I think they 
are INSANE.  
I would easily trade a few nights of screaming, for whole 
evenings of adult time.  Not to mention how badly you are 
screwing you
kid over by depriving them of the hours and hours of sleep
they need, that you don't.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, lest you think I am a completely callous bitch,
I hate the screaming.  It sucks, and like I said
to Blake, I wish I could somehow be with Cordelia to comfort
her, and simultaneously not be with her so she can learn how
to sleep by herself.  But the dangers of leaving your baby
to cry it out are hypothetical, while the dangers of sleep
deprivation are well documented, and this is the best way
of getting my children to get the amount of sleep they need
-- possibly the only way.
Weissbluth actually has a whole section about why he thinks
it's okay to let your baby cry it out, which I found quite
convincing, if hard to remember when the actual crying is
taking place and your blood pressure's up and your boobies
are leaking all over the place.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, so far so good.  As you can see, when we did this
with Delphine Blake actually thought it would be such
a big deal that it would need a whole 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/delphine/sleeping">category</a>
to itself.  You will also see that the category has only
one post; it really turned out to be a non-event, and
she has been a fantastic sleeper ever since.  Here's
hoping the same is true of Cordelia.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm sure Baba would like me to mention that Cordelia said
her first word: "Baba".  I think Russian grandmothers are
the smartest grandmothers, picking baby's very first consonant
to form their name.
