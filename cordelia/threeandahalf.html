<p>...although she doesn't like the idea. On Friday, when I told
her it was her three-and-a-halfth birthday, she said she was
too little, and also that her next birthday was going to be four!
I was going to bake her a cake, but clearly she wasn't interested
in the half-birthday thing, so I let it go.</p>
<p>She's grown about a mile since last I checked.  I took her into
the school this afternoon when I went in to help Delphine's class put
their jackets on, and I noticed Cordelia is taller than some of
the JKs. I know that's not unusual, but Delphine's always been
so relentlessly 50th percentile in terms of size (once she got
over being a mondo baby, that is), I find it weird to have a
taller-than-average child.  She's gaining on Delphine alarmingly - 
her 3-and-a-half height is only a centimeter or so short of 
Delphine's four height! I wonder how they will end up.</p>
<p>I would say Cordelia has come out of her shell, except anyone
who knows her knows she was never in a shell. But just lately 
she has become even more voluble, more dramatic, more funny,
more opinionated. She's also getting a little 3-and-a-halfish
in the sense that she is provoking power struggles about
stupid things, and over-reacting to things to see how far
that will get her. She's psycho, basically, at least some
of the time. We try to roll with it and not let her faze us
or throw off the whole day.</p>
<p>Cordelia spends a lot of time with Delphine. Yes, they fight
a lot but not all of the time. Delphine reads to her - they 
particularly like Chirp magazines - and... well, I'm not
sure what they do together. This afternoon they spent a good
hour out in the backyard, digging holes with sticks and watering
things which don't need water (like the deck). At one point
Delphine came inside to retrieve matzo, jam and almonds for a 
delectable picnic. It was lovely. For some reason they don't
seem to fight when they're outside. Maybe the house depresses
them as it does me.</p>
<p>Cordelia's all signed up for kindergarten in the fall.  I signed
her up for mornings because she's still napping at least 
five days out of seven. We still don't know whose class she'll
be in. I'm getting to know which are the better kindergarten teachers,
though, so this time I actually care whose class she's in. Hopefully
someone good. (You're not allowed to ask for a particular teacher, 
so if you do they put you in someone else's class on principle. Boo.)</p>
<p>Cordelia can sing! She sings herself to sleep most nights, and a few
weeks ago I was listening to her sing her usual autolullabye, the
ABC song.  She sang, "A B C... A B C... A B C D E F G" - the first
two times she sang it, she sang it on "do do fa". She didn't continue
until she had gotten it right: "do do so". Not only can she sing
in tune but she knows she can sing in tune! Obviously I am now
planning her career as an opera singer - she is very loud.</p>
<p>What else? We are all scheduled to the hilt with summer activities.
Well, more scheduled than last year (ie, we have some plans).  We
have three weeks off at the start of summer, then Delphine is going
to a day camp at a farm in the city.  After that the girls and
I are going to Sask for two weeks, and as soon as we get back
the girls are off to the cottage with Baba and Zaida. (Not sure
if I'm invited or not.) Once they get back, they are both signed
up for a day camp at Cordelia's nursery school. It will be the
first time Cordelia's done all-day anything, and it will be the
first time I have ever had all-day off for five days in a row.
(Except when I was in Sask by myself last September.)</p>
<p>So lots of firsts these days. I realized the other day that I
have no qualms whatsoever about taking the girls downtown on the
bus and subway alone - before, I would always be more comfortable 
if I had another grown-up, but now Delphine can be trusted to
be sensible, and Cordelia responds to verbal commands (sit! stay!)
so I know I don't have to be hanging on to one of them while
praying the other one doesn't do something stupid. It's like they're
real people! Halleluia!</p>
