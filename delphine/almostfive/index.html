Delphine is just under two months away from being five, and
in the last month or so she went through one of those quantum changes —
your kid goes to bed one day and she's four and a half, and
wakes up the next day and she's nearly five.  Her hair is
longer, her face is more girlish and less babyish, she has
all these freckles that came out of nowhere, she uses long
words and elaborate grammatical constructions, she can almost
read.  It's a bit dizzying, frankly, but I couldn't be happier.
The more she moves away from babyhood the more I like hanging
out with her.
</p>
<p>
So yeah, she can almost read.  I would say she's a few weeks
from really being able to read; she can sound out short
(phonically logical) words, and she is learning a few tricks
(like looking at the first letter and the associated picture
and guessing!) to work out the other 95% of the English
language.  She's also sight-learned a few words, which suits
me because that's largely how I (and I assume most literate
adults) read.
</p>
<p>
I will say now that I hate phonics.  I hated it when I was a
kid and I still hate it now.  I hated it when I was a kid because
it didn't work (and because I thought it was a lame crutch for
kids who couldn't "really" read — I was a huge snob when I was
a kid).  I hate it now because it still doesn't work; I feel like
such a fraud when I tell Delphine to "sound it out" when I know
that that's a technique which will hardly ever help her figure 
out a word.  I am 
perplexed by the
emphasis phonics receives, unless it's because no-one has come up
with a better way of "teaching" kids to read, and they want
to feel like they're doing something.  The English language is
too full of exceptions for phonics to be worth anything —
if you want to read anything more interesting than the most
pedestrian Easy Reader (another thing I hated as a kid) you
are going to come across the word "one" or the word "weigh"
or the word "said" and phonics is going to let you down.  I 
don't have any answers, though.  All I know is I figured out
how to read by being read to (no-one taught me) and I expect
my children will do that same, whether or not they 
learn "k-k-k-kite" at school.
</p>
<p>
Back to Delphine, who can also write.  She can form letters
like a demon, so she writes quickly if you spell things out for
her, but she's also really bold about writing on her own and
guessing how things are spelled.  She loves to write cards for
her friends.  "Athena I love you."  They are always love letters.
</p>
<p>
Okay, this is my last brag about Delphine, I promise.  We were
talking about aunties the other day; since she's been old enough
to talk we've been working with the convenient fiction that she
has two aunties, Auntie Morgan and Auntie J'Anne.  On Sunday I
decided she's old enough to understand that Auntie J'Anne is actually
Daddy's auntie and her Great-Aunt (although J'Anne is hardly the
quivering  old dear that the title implies).  To illustrate
the idea  I decided
to do a family tree.  I walked Delphine through drawing up a 
crude diagram with circles for each person and lines joining us all
up.  When it came to labelling, Delphine decided that she was going
to write each person's name around their circle, with the letters
projecting out perpendicular to the surface of the circle.  (I'll 
take a picture so you can see what I mean.)  And she did so, forming
each letter correctly with respect to the slope of the circle, without 
turning the paper around.  That means she can <em>rotate two-dimensional
objects in her head</em>!
</p>
<p>
Obviously I think that's pretty cool, whether or not almost-five is
exactly when you would expect someone to be able to rotate 
two-dimensional objects in their head (I have no idea).   It's
math!  Do you know what this means?  It means she'll be able to
read maps, and walk around strange cities without getting hopelessly
lost, and figure out where this bit goes on that bicycle without 
trying it!  It means she'll be able to do those useless spatial
manipulation questions in IQ tests!  I suppose I shouldn't be 
surprised that she has math
brain — she comes from two families of math heads — but I'm still
pleased.  Now we just need to get her doing cryptics.
</p>
<p>
Part of the being-almost-five (and not really four anymore) is that
Delphine is generally nicer to be around (don't let anyone tell you
about Terrible Twos, Four is much worse.  Twos get a bad rap.)  However
I can't get her to stop yelling at Cordelia.  Poor Cordelia seems
to get screamed at all day, when she won't give up a toy, when
she can't learn the rules of a game, when she hides wrong in 
Hide and Seek.  I know Delphine learned all about yelling from me,
but the scale is entirely different!  I have yelled at her fewer
than ten times in her whole life, whereas she seems to yell at
DeeDee ten times a day.  Well, maybe five.  I guess they mean
it when they say your bad behaviour will be reflected in your
kids' behaviour, but I didn't realize it would be magnified to 
this extent.  
I have a book out about managing Anger and Aggression (for parents
and children) so hopefully that will help.  Because I don't
have Clue One what to do at this point.  At least March Break is
over so they can get out of each other's hair for a while every
day.
