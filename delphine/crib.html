We've been putting Delphine to sleep in the crib, as Blake mentioned
below.  We started about a week and a half ago, with mixed results.
</p>
<p>
The first night we put her in the crib and then sat there like idiots
looking at her, thinking our very presence would calm her and
eventually she would lie down and sleep.  Instead she cried more, 
probably wondering why the hell we were just sitting there and not
rescuing her.  Once we lay down and pretended to be asleep she stopped
crying within a few minutes, and thereafter cried intermittently 
for a while before falling asleep.  It's quite possible that she slept
that entire night sitting up, but we didn't want to look in case she
wasn't really asleep.
</p>
<p>
The next night we did the bedtime routine and then put her down and
lay down right away, and it was much better; again only a few minutes
-- less than ten -- of crying and then intermittent crying for maybe
twenty or thirty minutes until she fell asleep.  (When I say intermittent
crying I mean one or two wails followed by three or four minutes of 
silence.)
</p>
<p>
The following night we moved her into her new bedroom, which turned out
well because it meant we didn't have to worry about waking her up when
we went to bed.  We put her down around 8:30 and then proceeded to go about
our evening like adults.  Adults with two free hands.  Amazing.  (For
the last fifteen months we have taken turns eating dinner because one
of us is holding the baby, we have taken turns brushing our teeth and
going to the washroom, and I have spent half my evenings with Delphine,
half-asleep, attached to a breast.)
</p>
<p>
We had one glorious night where I nursed her to sleep and then managed
to put her down in the crib without waking her, and she slept the 
<em>whole night through</em> without waking up.  We haven't duplicated
that feat, but I have high hopes.
</p>
<p>
I did a lot of soul-searching before we embarked on this process,
probably too much.  It made me realize how privileged I am that
my biggest worry is whether to let my child cry at bedtime -- not
how I am going to pay the rent, or whether I will be able to get
drinking water without being shot at or raped, or whether I will
be allowed to vote.  My mental wrangling
over this trivial matter bordered on the masturbatory, and frankly
annoyed me after a few weeks of it.  
</p>
<p>
At the end of all that I just
decided to get on with it, and soon realized that all the theory in the
world doesn't amount to much when faced with a real flesh-and-blood
child.  It didn't take long to learn that, contrary to my research
she actually cries a good deal less when we're <em>not</em> there,  
and when we don't go and visit her.  If we pulled a Ferber and went
and visited her every five minutes, she would just get worked up every
five minutes and never get to sleep.  "Crying it out" doesn't apply to
this child because she doesn't cry continuously when she's tired, she
cries for a few minutes and then stops, and soon falls asleep.
</p>
<p>
She does cry for longer if she's not actually tired; we made the mistake
of putting her down earlier (got that idea from Dr Weissbluth -- I wonder
how long it will be before I just ignore all the "experts" altogether)
and she cried for a solid fifteen minutes.  We retrieved her and she stayed
up for another hour or so before she was really ready for bed.
</p>
<p>
The crying bothers Blake more than it bothers me.  If I deliberately try
and imagine how she's feeling I get upset, but if I don't it's just noise.
I can easily dissociate myself from my emotions and the emotions of others.  
Maybe I'm autistic. Maybe I'm just a cold bitch.
