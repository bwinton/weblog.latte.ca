<p>...on Tuesday May 10. But her party was on Saturday, a perfect day for a party.
Delphine invited four friends: Ursa, Darina, Amelia and Rosebella. </p>
<p>The day was sunny and warm, and almost all the guessts arrived on time.
We started
the fun as we usually do, decorating brown paper lunch bags for loot bags.
This is a pretty good way to keep everybody busy while all the guests arrive,
although it's surprising how quickly a child can coat a paper bag with
glitter and stickers. The girls spent a good eight to ten minutes on their bags
before disappearing upstairs to "visit" the cat. I don't like parties to go
upstairs because it creates far too much mess, so I called them down and sent
them outside to play while we waited for the one straggler to arrive. </p>
<p>After the final guest appeared, we rounded up the whole gang and 
walked up to a nearby parkette to terrorize unsuspecting dog walkers
with a series of silly races. We did a traditional speed race, then
a hopping race, a egg and spoon race, a three-legged race and a sack
race. It was a pretty nice combination: the speediest kid was totally
hamstrung by the sack race, the least athletic kid turned out to have 
nerves of steel and totally shellacked everyone in the egg and spoon
race.  Delphine won the sack race because most of the big kids collapsed
in exhaustion and the little kids just kept falling over.</p>
<p>After everyone was worn out and sweaty we headed back to the house
— curiously, the children managed to muster enough energy to run
most of the way there — for sub sandwiches and cheesies and
apple juice. Everyone was happy with lunch. Even the children who don't
like sandwiches (seriously?! Who <em>doesn't like sandwiches</em>?) were
convinced to disassemble their sandwiches and enjoyed all the ingredients
thereof. </p>
<p>Delphine once again designed an awesome and original cake: lemon cake
sandwiching a thick layer of rainbow sherbet, with blue buttercream icing. I
decorated it with kosher jelly candy shaped like slices of citrus fruit. (On
sale after Passover.) The cake was a hit with everyone; some kids ate just the
cake, some kids ate just the sherbet — no-one ate just the icing, I guess
that stops at about five or six — and some kids ate the whole thing and
had seconds.</p>
<p>Next Delphine opened her presents, slowly, paying great attention to each
gift, much to the irritation of those children whose gifts she hadn't 
opened yet. She got a Geronimo Stilton book which she was very gracious
about even though she has been openly scornful of Geronimo Stilton
lately. (It's come up because Cordelia likes Geronimo Stilton —
they read them at daycare.) From the same child she also got 
<em>Happy Birthday Bad Kitty</em> by Nick Bruel, which is a fairly witty
comic/novel hybrid. From her school bestie she got the puzzle game Rush
Hour. From her friend down the street she got a big sketchpad, a box
of bright, gorgeous oil pastels and a book called <em>The Sisters 8</em>.</p>
<p>The best present was from Ursa, or rather her mother Tanya. Tanya
snuck all through the house and hid a series of clues leading Delphine
to her gift, a set of stilts. Delphine <em>loves</em> a treasure hunt, and she
was thrilled with the treasure, too. The girls spent a good part of the rest
of the party trying them out.</p>
<p>Gradually all the kids except Ursa left (Ursa's a semi-permanent addition to
our household and doesn't count as company). I was just about to collapse into
well-earned slumber (did I mention the day before the party I published a book?
Well, I did. More about that soon.) when my friends Kat and Joel arrived. Kat
had been away in Asia for weeks so I peeled myself off the couch to give her a
hug and make some tea.</p>
<!-- Kat brought Delphine a beautiful red silk cheongsam, and for Cordelia a
set of glow-in-the-dark rubber bangles. -->

<p>The party finally came to an end when Ursa and Kat and Joel went home.
Delphine went to bed happy and exhausted.</p>
