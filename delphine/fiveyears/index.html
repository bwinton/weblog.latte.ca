Delphine turned five this Saturday, and we had a party 
on the deck.
Delphine invited five of her friends, and between food
and cleaning up and decorating and games and loot it
was almost as much work as a grown-up party.  But
now the house is clean!  Ish.
</p>
<p>
The night before her birthday, Delphine slept over at
Baba and Zaida's house.  Baba wanted to take Delphine
to <a href="http://www.sciencerendezvous.ca/">Science
Rendezvous</a> in the morning, and I had a book club 
meeting Friday night, so a sleepover was advantageous
for all.  
</p>
<p>
Saturday dawned bright but not as early as usual; 
we had put Cordelia down early on Friday so between
that and not having Delphine around to wake her, 
she slept in until 7:45.  (Did you know if you put
your kids to bed earlier they sleep later?  Weird
but true.)  We got up and leapt into action; Blake
and Cordelia picked up flowers and bread and pickles, I cleaned
up and made egg salad and iced cupcakes and put up
the daisy decorations Delphine had made.  After 
lunch we put Cordelia down for an early nap, and 
Auntie Morgan came over to help out.
</p>
<p>
The party started at 2:00, and Delphine only got
home a few minutes before that in time to put on her new
red party dress.  All the partiers arrived on time
—Ursa, Erika, Tina, Sydney, and Athena, and four
out of the five Mums stayed, which was cool; also
in attendance were Baba and Zaida and Auntie Morgan
and Uncle Erik —
and we got into the swing of things: crafts, a treasure
hunt (the treasure was wrapped boxes of Nerds),
some dancing games (they didn't seem to enjoy those
much), Pass the Parcel (that was a huge hit), and
of course little sandwiches, chips, cake, ice cream
and jelly (Jell-o, except made with real juice).
(That was a really long sentence with altogether
too much punctuation.)
There was a good bit of random running around the 
backyard, too, which was more popular than I 
expected.
</p>
<p>
Delphine mostly had a good time — she got mad
at me when I didn't take her suggestion for a
music game (who knew "Row Row Row Your Boat" was
even a game?) but otherwise it was nice.  There is
some weird bullying/power abuse going on with
one of the girls and we tried to ameliorate that
as much as we could, but Delphine wasn't directly
involved so it didn't seem to bother her.  We'll
have the "victim" over for a playdate sometime to
make her feel more welcome and loved.  (She — the
victim — is
a very intensely affectionate little girl, and 
that annoys the others a bit, and so they are
mean to her – they say she can't play with
them.  Not surprisingly she's also
intensely emotional so she takes it seriously
when someone says something hurtful.  It's a 
mess; I'm so glad I'm not a little girl any
more!  That sucked!)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, apart from that the party was a hit, and
Delphine got some great presents and had a lovely
day.   
</p>
<p>
In addition
to turning five, she has also grown two centimeters
in the last month, and she can now read upside-down.
Well, she can't properly read books and stuff, but
she's getting pretty good at picking out individual
words as long as their spelling is "standard".  I
guess the memorization of non-standard words really
begins once you start reading in earnest and encounter
those words more.  (Although of course she can read
"one" and "two" which are non-standard, so I guess 
she has already started to build up that database.)
She's working on learning to ride a bike without
training wheels, and to skip.  Five is going to
be a very exciting year!
