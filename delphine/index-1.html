    I forgot one more Delphine milestone; this weekend, she put something
<em>in</em> something else!  Until now she has been the Queen of Chaos,
the Renter of Things Asunder, the knocker down of neat piles and 
puller-outer of things from other things.  So this is exciting and new
and heralds days of putting things away and tidying up.

Just in time for her eleven-month birthday, there is finally something
new to report in the land of Delphine.
</p>
<p>
First, she is growing at least one, and perhaps two new teeth on top.
It has been five months since the two on the bottom came in, so these
are long-awaited.  They don't seem to be giving her much trouble at
the moment.  They will come in handy in her new practice of taking bites
out of a piece of fruit; last week I shared a plum with her.
</p>
<p>
Second, yesterday she stood by herself, once when playing with Blake and 
once with
Morgan.  She can walk quite nicely if you hold both her hands, so sometime
soon she'll put it all together and ta-da!  I'll have a toddler.  I
think my prior estimate of walking before she's a year old was optimistic;
I didn't anticipate that her development would plateau for a month or
two as it has.  Darn these non-deterministic babies.
</p>
<p>
And finally, I gave her egg over the weekend (in chopped liver and fruit
kugel; Passover is a very egg-intensive holiday) and she hasn't yet 
imploded, exploded, broken out in hives or turned into a turnip, so I
think I can assume she's not allergic to eggs.  This is good, because
it means she can have birthday cake next month.  And generally it means
that lots of food that was verboten is now in her repertoire, so it will
make feeding her much easier.

There isn't much going on with Delphine lately.  She's
been busy having colds lately, and that seems to have put a damper on her
development.  She's still cruising, not walking, and babbling, not talking.
She is still very mild-mannered and observant and generally a pleasure to
be around, except when she's miserable about being sick.
</p>
<p>
We have been reading to her a lot.  I read a book called <em>Babies Need
Books</em> by Dorothy Butler which I can't recommend enough.  Butler is
passionate about books, and she makes a very strong argument as to why and how
babies should be exposed to books at a very young age.
</p>
<p>
I had given up on the book thing when Delphine was about eight months old
because she didn't seem interested in reading, more in pulling the books
apart and eating them.  The Butler book convinced me to try again, with 
more patience, and it seems to have worked.  One of the things Butler says
is that babies always go through a stage of demolishing books when they're
first exposed to them, whether that be at six months or three years.  You
just have to forge through it until they learn that the content of the
books is more interesting than the flavour of them.
</p>
<p>
So I tried again, picking a few of the books Butler recommends, and it's
really working.  Reading is now the main activity we do together (since Delphine
doesn't really play with anything yet) and Del seems to enjoy it.  She 
looks at the pages and turns them, sometimes even at the appropriate time, if
it's a book she knows well, like <em>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You 
See?</em>.  She does all the activities in <em>Pat The Bunny</em> except
sniffing the flowers, and I can't say I blame her about that.
</p>
<p>
One of the things which made reading easier is that I stopped being such
a stickler about how we read together.  I used to think that she had to
be in my lap, but now I'll read to her while she's sitting apart from me
and playing with something else.  It helps that I can read upside down,
so I can point the book at her and read the text from above.
</p>
<p>
I'm really enjoying all the great books out there.  The Butler book helped
me get a feel for what makes a good baby book, and each week we go to the
library and I'm able to find half-a-dozen books which fit the bill.  I
really like <em>Mr Grumpy's Outing</em> by John Burningham, and 
<em>Peepo!</em> by Janet and Allen Ahlberg, the Mog books, <em>Brown
Bear</em>... there are a million of them.  I just got <em>Hand Hand
Fingers Thumb</em>, a Dr Suess book (although not by Dr Suess) which is
hilarious.  Except the text says "monkey" and the pictures are chimps.   Sigh.
I'll have to clear that up with her when she gets older.
</p>
<p>
That's all. Go read <a href="http://smartypants.diaryland.com/">Mimi
Smartypants</a> and <a href="http://www.dooce.com/">Dooce</a>.

    <h4>Statistics</h4>

Weight: 21 lbs<br>
Height: 28.7 inches<br><p>
Delphine has now been out longer than she was in, and she seems to be
taking well to the outside world.
</p>
<p>
She is growing famously, but sloping gradually towards the 75th 
percentile (she started off at the 95th).  She's still proportionate,
although more a chubby baby than a skinny baby.  She's very strong
and I'm pretty sure she'll be walking by her first birthday.  She
has been crawling for a few weeks now, and she loves to stand up,
holding on to a table or chair, whenever she can get away with it.
</p>
<p>
She vocalizes with consonants ("blah, blah" or "dah dah") sometimes,
and has just mastered the fine art of the raspberry.  I don't think
she'll be talking particularly early.
</p>
<p>
She still only has the two teeth on the bottom, although Blake
thinks he might have spotted one on the top today.  The first two
came in in November, so the next batch is overdue, but me and
my nipples are okay with that.
</p>
<p>
She's still nursing a couple of times a day, in the afternoon and
evening, and through the night.  In addition, she's eating pretty much
everything except the big choking and allergy hazards.  I just started
her on (cows') milk yesterday, but she still hasn't really figured out
either a bottle or a sippy cup, so most of it ends up on her shirt.
I'm hoping once she figures out how to drink milk she'll ease off even
more on the nursing and maybe I'll actually ovulate again!  That would
be good.
</p>
<p>
I took her to Florida last week to visit my in-laws, 
and we had a great time, although it
was far from the vacation I had imagined.  I thought she was over
separation anxiety, but when we were in Florida she didn't want to
be in anyone's arms but mine for the first three days.  I think that's
reasonable; we were in a completely new environment, I can see why
she would want to experience it from a place of known safety.  Anyway,
by day four she happily went off to visit neighbours with my father-in-law,
and on day five she played in the pool with my mother-in-law without
a peep.
</p>
<p>
I wondered for a minute whether she's <em>too</em> attached, since she is on
on near me all day and night most days.  I felt kind of weird in Florida
when I realized that she naps on me <em>and</em> sleeps with me.  On the
other hand, everyone comments on how alert and composed she is, how relaxed
and quiet, and that's got to be at least somewhat because of how secure she
is in my constant presence and love.

I was desperately clicking around The Usual Suspects trying to find
a place to pimp this journal, until I realized, duh, that's what I
have a weblog for.

<p>
So, go read <a href="http://www.dooce.com/">Dooce</a>.  She just had
a baby (no, like, two weeks ago) and she's fucking funny and I love her
already.

But I do need to come to terms with the possibility of some grumpy 
single person shooting me a disapproving look as I bounce a fussy 
baby in one arm while I reach for a gallon of milk with the other 
arm, as if my baby has no business being in a public place. I was 
once that grumpy single person, and I feel her pain, the pain of 
sleeping more than eight hours a night, the pain of eating a warm 
meal with two hands, the pain of chugging two double vodka martinis 
without fear of poisoning another human being. And I want to say to 
the grumpy, single me of several years ago - the grumpy, single me 
who kept up with her eyebrows and had her nails professionally 
manicured every two weeks - I want to say, FUCKING WHORE! And 
then I want to choke her and beat her with a wooden club.

On Friday Morgan and I took Delphine swimming at the local community centre
where they have a baby pool, a shallow pool with warm water and 
wide graduated steps.
</p>
<p>
Delphine did not take to the water like a fish.  She wasn't scared,
but she wasn't willing to give it her whole-hearted commendation 
without further study.  So we sat in the shallows, and she
considered.
</p>
<p>
If you haven't met Delphine, I should explain now that she is a very
serious little person.  She approaches new situations with gravity
and deliberation, studying her surroundings with big, blue, unblinking
eyes before deciding if she approves.
</p>
<p>
It took her a good ten or fifteen minutes of thought before she 
concluded that sitting in a large puddle of warm water doesn't
suck.  She learned how to splash herself by pounding on the surface
of the water, never failing to be surprised by the result.
*splash!*  *blink* *blink*  "What happened?  My face is wet."
Then she got her hands on a toy orca and chewed contentedly
on its tail and watched the other children until it was time to 
get out of the pool.  
</p>
<p>
Altogether I think we sat for at least forty minutes.  While Delphine
studied and considered and decided, Morgan and I watched the other
people.  There was a little boy with red goggles who talked to
everyone, there was a girl in a red flowery suit who was fascinated
with Delphine, there was a mom who constructed an elaborate
Rube Goldbergian fountain out of flutter boards and watering cans.
It was a hoot.  We'll go again.

    <p>
...although I feel like I should.
</p>
<p>
One: I don't read to Delphine.  I know you're supposed to read to children
from the moment they're born to imbue in them a deep and abiding
respect for the written word, but reading to Delphine is and has
always been a wresting match in which I attempt to prevent her 
from eating the written word.  So whatever intangible benefit you're
supposed to get from being read to as an infant, Delphine's not
getting it.
</p>
<p>
Two: I only bath her once a week.  Other people say "Oh, I hardly ever
bath my baby, once every three days is enough!"  Or ever four
days, or so.  Not Delphine!  She gets a wash every seven, whether
she needs it or not.  I don't think it's doing her any harm.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
In other news, she's learned to crawl on her hands and knees.  She
doesn't choose to do so very often, but she can, I've seen her.  She
still prefers to creep about on her belly, like a snake.  I'm going 
to make her an outfit out of Swiffer cloths and rent her out.
</p>
<p>
She's starting to get the pincer grasp, so I let her feed herself
little puffed rices and shredded cheese.  She's also eating tofu, and
I think tonight I will set some of our pork aside and blend it up
for her lunch tomorrow.  Meat!
</p>
<p>
She's learned to get back down to ground level from standing, which
is great news because previously, her only option was to fall
over and hit her head.  It also makes her very mobile and pretty
much the master of all she surveys; she can go from sitting to standing,
standing to sitting, sitting to crawling, crawling to standing.
Since the condo is generally safe I let her hang out on the floor,
exploring and humming to herself, for long stretches of time while
I get stuff done.

It's been ages since I've updated, and a lot has changed, although
it seems like mostly in the last couple of day.
</p>
<p>
Delphine's a champion stander now; she easily pulls herself up on
whatever is around, and she will stand and play at a coffee table
or chair for ages.  She's even started experimenting with only 
holding on with one hand, and she  cruises from one piece of
furniture to another.
</p>
<p>
On the crawling front, though, she hasn't advanced much.  She can
get around pretty quickly, but she's still commando-crawling, and
hasn't discovered the superiority of the hands-and-knees technique.
I'm beginning to wonder if she won't bypass that stage altogether
and skip right to walking.
</p>
<p>
Much to my relief, she has finally discovered consonants; Friday
she figured out muh-muh-muh-muh, and by Sunday she had added
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba and da-da-da-da-da.  Soon she'll be writing sonnets.
</p>
<p>
She's eating lots of different foods now; fruits, vegetables, 
cereals, yogurt, cottage cheese and beans.  This week I'm going to 
give her tofu, and then we'll try actual dead animal.  The only 
thing that seems to stop her is chunks; she still likes things
well pureed, or else she has to make dealthy gagging sounds until
I rescue her from the killer peas!  In her mouth!  And then sometimes
she vomits.  I've learned my lesson.
</p>
<p>
She's cut her nursing way back; she doesn't nurse at all in the morning,
and sometimes we go all afternoon without nursing either.  She
still nurses in the evening and through the night.  The only thing
that settles her when she wakes overnight, in fact, is nursing.  
Sometimes I get tired of being the human pacifier, but it's not 
like she'll be a baby forever.
</p>
<p>
She's well and truly into the separation anxiety phase, apparently
right on time.  She doesn't even like it when her aunt or grandpa
hold her, and she never used to have a problem with them.  Now,
it's Mum or Dad or nobody.
</p>
<p>
We went to playgroup for the first time 
last Wednesday; it's a program with music,
games and crafts.  I signed us up as much for an activity for me
as anything.  I need something to break up the weeks or this
winter is going to last for years.  
</p>
<p>
I was really looking forward
to it, to learning some new songs and meeting other mothers, and
in that respect it was disappointing.  I didn't like some of
the new songs, and the ones she sung that I knew were kind of 
mangled: "hush-a, hush-a" in "Ring Around the Rosies" instead
of "a-tishoo, a-tishoo", and "all around the town" in "The
Wheels on the Bus" instead of "all the livelong day", not that
that makes any sense.  I know they're folk songs, and that's what
they do, change, but it seemed weird and wrong.  I'll get
over it.
</p>
<p>
The other mothers weren't so friendly; I felt like the new
girl all over again, trying to make eye contact and smile and
be friendly, and everyone seemed to avoid my eyes and close
off into their cliques.  It was quite weird.  I did end up
elbowing my way into a conversation or two, and I'm sure it 
will get better as the weeks go on.
</p>
<p>

<p>
I've decided I'm going to stop worrying about whether I'm
doing things right. I kept second-guessing myself; should
I be feeding Del this, or that?  Should I try and make her
sleep in the crib?  Should I nurse her more?  Less?  Make
her nap longer?  How?  Hold her more often?  Less often?
Read to her?  Make her listen to classical music?  Describe
everything she sees, loudly, like some 
deranged docent?
</p>
<p>
Finally I realized that I'm a reasonably intelligent and 
emotionally stable and if I follow my instincts and listen
to my heart, I won't go far wrong.  I don't need her to
pass the RCM Grade 12 piano exam by the time she's eight,
or cure cancer or remedy world hunger.  All I want for her
is happiness, and right now that means sleeping with me and
eating bananas and going for walks.
</p>
<p>
She's pretty smart, too, and I'm sure she'll figure out how
to go to sleep by herself, and how to talk, and how to read,
without me shoving it all down her neck.

    <p>Last night, as I (Blake) was holding Delphine, and letting her chew on
my finger, I noticed that it hurt a little more than usual.  When I
checked further, I felt the top of her first tooth!  I immediately
passed her to Amy, to double check, and we both agreed that there was
a tiny sharp something there.  I think it was the first time I've
noticed something new about Delphine, and I'm quite excited about it.
Amy claims that she even saw the tooth, but Del refused to let us get
a picture of it (sorry, Mom).  Every time something like this happens,
I realize a little more that she's not going to be the tiny perfect
baby that she currently is for the rest of her life.  She's growing
up, at a rather alarming rate, and I'm very excited to find out who
she'll be at various points.</p>
