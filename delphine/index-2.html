    <h4>Words Delphine Says</h4>
<p>
Cat.  Duck.  Ball.  Daddy.  Mummy.  (She doesn't quite know who is which, though.)
Baby.  No.  (Sometimes polysyllabically, Aussie-style.)  Bubby (for
my chestal region and the pleasures thereof.)  Down, as a nice counterpoint to
"up!".  She sometimes says "Up please".  Other times she just says
"Up UP!"
</p>

<h4>Fifteen Month Stats, Finally</h4>
<p>
She was 22 lbs 11 oz, and 30.7 inches, meaning she had gained 11 oz and .7 inches
since her one-year checkup.  That's not very much; she's slid from the 95th percentile
at birth to the 50th now.  Yeah, I know they're not supposed
to gain much in the second year, but more than that.    Anyway, she seems bigger now
so maybe she has had that growth spurt we've all been waiting for.  Her next checkup
is November 17th.

<h4>Sleeping, Eating, Teeth, Hair</h4>
<p>
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/baby/pics/2004/1011/02-w-sleeping.jpg"><img src="http://www.latte.ca/baby/pics/2004/1011/02-t-sleeping.jpg" align="right" alt="Asleep"></a>
She's still sleeping in the crib.  The last couple of nights have been great, the
couple before that not so good, and so on.  It's a process.  I'm surprised by how
she has taken to it, though.  After we go through our bedtime routine (diaper, jammies,
teeth, nurse) she veritably lunges for the crib face-down, tucks all her limbs underneath
her and goes right to sleep.
</p>
<p>
She has just started cutting her canines.  Once they are in each type of tooth --
incisors, molars and canines -- will be represented, meaning she can eat anything
we can eat.  I don't buy much food especially for her anymore, apart from crackers
and high-fat dairy products.  She still loves tomatoes more than anything, and I don't
think there's anything that she particularly dislikes, although she's not very
interested in most things.  Perhaps I am nursing her too much?  I didn't think that
was possible, but then I have only read the hippie attachment parenting books
on the subject.
<br clear="all"></p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/baby/pics/2004/1011/01-w-haircut.jpg"><img src="http://www.latte.ca/baby/pics/2004/1011/01-t-haircut.png" align="left" alt="New hairdo"></a>
I cut her hair for the first time yesterday -- the front is still really short, so
I trimmed the sides and back so it doesn't look so mulletty.  It's much better now,
and she kind of looks older.  I didn't do a fantastic job, technically; the sides
look a bit hacked at, and there are a couple of wisps at the back that I couldn't
get because she kept moving away, but her hair is haphazard enough in general that
my clumsy efforts don't stand out.
</p>

<h4>More</h4>
<p>
All these dry factoids are inadequate to express what Delphine's like, how she is.
She's so interesting, funny, clever.  She loves to be read to, and to go for walks.
She is fascinated by plants.  She can stroke the cats gently.  She dances to music,
bouncing and turning around and rocking from foot to foot.  She likes to clean up,
walking around the house with a rag wiping things, and "sweeping up" with a whisk
brush (really she finds the neat piles of stuff that I have swept, and flings them
around with her brush).  She loves to say no: "Nnnn-aaaa-oooo!"  She is a hundred
times more interesting now than when she was a baby, and I love to be with her.  I
miss her when she is sleeping or out with her auntie or grandparents.  She is both
lovely, and amazing, and I tell her so all the time.

I think I can officially declare that Delphine's first word is
"up!"  Spoken imperiously while tugging on pant legs or holding up
a book to be read.  She also says "Hi" and "Byebye" (actually
"Buh-bye") but it's hard to tell whether she knows what they mean.
"Buh-bye" is always accompanied by waving.  She also makes a 
credible attempt at "Zeyde": "Tz-da", but she definitely doesn't know
what (who) it means.
</p>
<p>
In other news, she's sleeping pretty well in the crib.  She wails a few
little wails when we put her down, and then drops off to sleep and 
stays there until about 5:00 am or 6:00 am.  Then we bring her into
bed and I desperately try and catch another hour of sleep while she 
has breakfast.  I would like her to not cry when we put her down, and
I would like her to not wake up so early, but I do not know how to 
go about effecting either of those things.  I suppose I could go back
to the advice books I scorned so thoroughly earlier, but I don't think
I'm ready for that yet.
</p>
<p>
She's eating pretty well, although I'm breaking a couple of rules
in order to get her to eat: I don't sit her down in her high chair
and feed her.  Instead, we hang out in the living room
and I give her bites of whatever she's having while she toddles around
and plays and hangs out.  She seems to eat more that way.  I only do
that for one meal a day, though, and for the other two I make her sit
properly.  It's not bedlam here, you know.  
</p>
<p>
The other rule I break is that I let her wander around with her sippy 
cup of milk, which is supposed to be bad for their teeth or make them 
obese or something.  In general I'm not doing a great job looking after
her teeth.  She won't let me brush them, and I don't know what the hell
to do.  Every few days I poke at them ineffectually with her pink and
yellow baby toothbrush while she clenches her jaw.  Maybe one day she'll 
actually let me in 
there.  Anyway, I'm sure my parents never brushed my teeth as a baby,
and I turned out fine!  (A sound and popular argument among proponents
of many a lousy parenting technique.)
</p>
<p>
My friend Tanya from pre-natal class and I are both poking idly at
the idea of doing something productive with our lives; me working
for my father-in-law to earn money to buy a dishwasher, she making
a documentary about her husband's family's pursuit of Native status,
or something.  Clearly she is far cooler than me.  Anyway, to that end
we need someone else to take care of our babies while we do our shit.
We bandied about a few ideas, and finally settled on each other!  We're
going to trade a few hours of child care a week.  I'm a little nervous --
make that terrified -- about looking after a second toddler, but it's
worth a try.  Maybe it won't be so bad?  It might be fun, even.  And
one day soon (I hope) I'll have to look after two kids all the time, so
this will be good practice.
</p>
<p>
Oh yes.  I don't know if I should post about this because it seems like
an overshare (I know, I've overshared so much, why stop now?  Because
I've finally realized that family reads this sometimes is why.)  Anyway,
I still haven't got my period back, and I'm getting impatient, so I've
decided if I'm still not fertile by the end of the year I will wean Delphine.
It will suck, but I don't want my kids to be years and years apart.  If
I were my mother I would be six months pregnant with my second child
already.  So, the clock is ticking for Miss Delphine's love/love relationship
with my bosom.

We've been putting Delphine to sleep in the crib, as Blake mentioned
below.  We started about a week and a half ago, with mixed results.
</p>
<p>
The first night we put her in the crib and then sat there like idiots
looking at her, thinking our very presence would calm her and
eventually she would lie down and sleep.  Instead she cried more, 
probably wondering why the hell we were just sitting there and not
rescuing her.  Once we lay down and pretended to be asleep she stopped
crying within a few minutes, and thereafter cried intermittently 
for a while before falling asleep.  It's quite possible that she slept
that entire night sitting up, but we didn't want to look in case she
wasn't really asleep.
</p>
<p>
The next night we did the bedtime routine and then put her down and
lay down right away, and it was much better; again only a few minutes
-- less than ten -- of crying and then intermittent crying for maybe
twenty or thirty minutes until she fell asleep.  (When I say intermittent
crying I mean one or two wails followed by three or four minutes of 
silence.)
</p>
<p>
The following night we moved her into her new bedroom, which turned out
well because it meant we didn't have to worry about waking her up when
we went to bed.  We put her down around 8:30 and then proceeded to go about
our evening like adults.  Adults with two free hands.  Amazing.  (For
the last fifteen months we have taken turns eating dinner because one
of us is holding the baby, we have taken turns brushing our teeth and
going to the washroom, and I have spent half my evenings with Delphine,
half-asleep, attached to a breast.)
</p>
<p>
We had one glorious night where I nursed her to sleep and then managed
to put her down in the crib without waking her, and she slept the 
<em>whole night through</em> without waking up.  We haven't duplicated
that feat, but I have high hopes.
</p>
<p>
I did a lot of soul-searching before we embarked on this process,
probably too much.  It made me realize how privileged I am that
my biggest worry is whether to let my child cry at bedtime -- not
how I am going to pay the rent, or whether I will be able to get
drinking water without being shot at or raped, or whether I will
be allowed to vote.  My mental wrangling
over this trivial matter bordered on the masturbatory, and frankly
annoyed me after a few weeks of it.  
</p>
<p>
At the end of all that I just
decided to get on with it, and soon realized that all the theory in the
world doesn't amount to much when faced with a real flesh-and-blood
child.  It didn't take long to learn that, contrary to my research
she actually cries a good deal less when we're <em>not</em> there,  
and when we don't go and visit her.  If we pulled a Ferber and went
and visited her every five minutes, she would just get worked up every
five minutes and never get to sleep.  "Crying it out" doesn't apply to
this child because she doesn't cry continuously when she's tired, she
cries for a few minutes and then stops, and soon falls asleep.
</p>
<p>
She does cry for longer if she's not actually tired; we made the mistake
of putting her down earlier (got that idea from Dr Weissbluth -- I wonder
how long it will be before I just ignore all the "experts" altogether)
and she cried for a solid fifteen minutes.  We retrieved her and she stayed
up for another hour or so before she was really ready for bed.
</p>
<p>
The crying bothers Blake more than it bothers me.  If I deliberately try
and imagine how she's feeling I get upset, but if I don't it's just noise.
I can easily dissociate myself from my emotions and the emotions of others.  
Maybe I'm autistic. Maybe I'm just a cold bitch.

    <p>
Yesterday we took Delphine for her fifteen month checkup.  Everything
was generally fine, but she is not growing as fast as she probably 
should be.  I don't know the exact numbers (Blake?) but I think
she has gained less than a pound since her last checkup at a year,
and at that checkup she hadn't gained enough, either.  It could be
that she's just growing in fits and starts, and this is a slow period,
or it could be that she's really not getting enough of the right things
to eat.  (Or I suppose it could be something more sinister, but that's
unlikely and not worth worrying about at this point.)
</p>
<p>
I find it hard to get her to eat -- she will have a few mouthfuls of
something and then push it away, and she is fairly selective about what
she eats.  Today I tried Dr Sears's 
<a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/3/T030800.asp#T031200">nibble tray</a> 
method:
I put Cheerios (multi-grain), raspberries, some potato, and frozen peas
into the compartments of a tart tray (like a muffin tin, but shallower).
She actually did eat a fair bit of this morning's selection, and
(surprisingly) not too much of it got ground into the carpet.
</p>
<p>
She's been miserably sick lately, with some kind of non-respiratory
virus which had her feverish and shaking and puking.  (First puke!)
She hardly ate at all for a few days.  I'm glad we're still nursing 
because that was the only thing she would take -- I couldn't get her to
drink milk or water, or eat anything.  I may never wean her, it's
so convenient.  I think she's better now; she slept all night with
no crying, and the viral rash has gone.  
</p>
<p>
She started walking on Friday; just decided it was time, I guess.  She's
steady on her feet, because she's been practicing for so long.
It's fun and a little thrilling to watch her walking around, as blasé
as if she has been doing it for weeks.
</p>
<p>
She doesn't talk yet, at least not in English; sometimes it sounds like
Cantonese, sometimes it sounds like German.  For a week or so she was
calling the cats "Meeaaooow", so it could be that her first word was
in cat.  Hmph.

We've decided to teach Delphine to sleep by herself in a crib.  I guess I
knew that this day would come eventually, but I had hoped that she would
decide to sleep on her own, uh, on her own.  Or at the very least to be
able to understand why we were leaving her alone, and to try to work with
us at least a little.  But she didn't, and isn't, and so she cries and
cries, and it breaks my heart to not be able to go and pick her up and hold
her and cuddle her until she's all better.  But I know that that wouldn't
teach her that she's okay sleeping on her own, so I restrain myself.  On
the other hand, I can't help but wonder whether not going to her is just
teaching her that she can't depend on us for help and comforting when she
needs it.  Being a father is really hard sometimes.
</p>
<p>
Update: For the past two nights, she hasn't woken up when we put her to
bed, and so has ended up sleeping through the night.  Here's hoping that
this is a trend that continues.
</p>
<p>
Update #2: It didn't.  She woke up and cried at 4:00 am this morning.  But
I think she might be getting a new tooth, and in pain.  I would normally
give her Tylenol, but it wouldn't last through the night, so that plan is a
non-starter.  Maybe I'll suggest it if she wakes up again.

Delphine is almost fifteen months old.  The last couple of weeks have
been very interesting.  She has demonstrated, numerous times, that
she is perfectly capable of walking, and would rather not, thank you.  I
think she doesn't like the instability of it.  Eventually her balance
will get better and the convenience of walking with outweigh the security
of crawling, but for now it's hands on the floor for her.
</p>
<p>
Last week she laughed at her first verbal humour: "Socks!  Ka-pocks!
Shoes!  Ka-poes!  Pants!  Ka-pants!"  This is very funny stuff indeed,
you have no idea.
</p>
<p>
She is babbling a lot, and is a pretty competent mimic.  She likes "bababa"
and "dadada" best (typical!) but has attempted, with varying degrees of 
success, such diverse words as "cheesestick", "step" and "Zaida".
</p>
<p>
She doesn't seem to eat much, but she's still nursing a lot. I would like her
to nurse less so I can ovulate already, but I'm not sure how to go about it.
She's pretty insistent about it when she wants to nurse, and it's the 
easiest way to get her to sleep, especially during the day when Blake isn't
around with his magic shoulder.
</p>
<p>
She's still sleeping with us, but I would like to move her to the crib.
I have thought and thought about it and I think the only way to do it
will involve some crying.  We've made a couple of attempts to sneak her
into the crib after she's asleep, but she always either wakes up when
we're putting her down, or wakes up later and cries.  I'm planning to
do a Ferber type thing, going in to visit her at regular intervals until
she falls asleep.  I read the Pantley book, <em>The No-Cry Sleep Solution</em>
and I don't think her idea of repeatedly picking her up and soothing her,
then putting her down in the crib, will work because she cries 
<em>instantly</em> when we put her down, and we end up spending the whole
night holding her.  But we're establishing a bedtime routine, and I'm
going to see if she finds a transitional object; I do want to make this
easy on her, and us.  We're starting this weekend.  Unless we chicken out,
like we have the last two weekends.
</p>
<p>
I can see her becoming a toddler; she is getting to be much more assertive
about her world.  She cries when you take something away from her that
she wanted, or when you tell her not to do something appealing like put her
hand in the toilet or pick up cigarette butts.  She will put up a good
tug-of-war with other babies if they both want the same toy, although
Delphine generally gives up first and cries, thereby winning because the
parents inevitably step in and give her the toy, because the other kid looks
like the big meany.  She is <em>so smart</em>!
</p>
<p>
She's becoming more fascinated with cats and dogs.  She can find the cat
in any picture (if there is one, obviously) and she can point to where
the real-life cats are, too.  She always looks when we see dogs when we're
out.  I think in September I will take her to the zoo and see what she makes
of all the other animals.
</p>
<p>
I can't think of anything else, except that she's so lovely and interesting
and good.  This morning we went to the bulk food store, and I parked her in 
the stroller just inside the door while I collected my groceries, and she
just sat there and looked around and didn't make a peep.   What a baby.

Delphine's first birthday was two Mondays ago, on the tenth.  We had a
special dinner with cake and jelly, and I already put up 
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/~arbrown/baby/pics/2004/0511/index2.html">pictures 
in the gallery</a> so I bet you already know about it.  It was a good birthday,
I think, as first ones go.  
</p>
<p>
<!--
Her family knows how to pick good presents,
so she got a <a href="http://www.fisher-price.com/us/babyu/product.asp?s=bupeek&id=22095&index=2&pos=2">Fisher-Price Peek-a-Blocks wagon</a> from my folks, 
a box of Duplo from Blake's parents, a purse and her very own set of keys 
(genius!)
from Morgan and Erik, and an Indigo gift certificate from Uncle
Dave.  I used that to buy the Dr Suess ABC Book and <em>Where's Spot?</em>,
both of which are very cool.  Blake and I bought her a 
<a href="http://www.fisher-price.com/us/products/product.asp?id=199">corn
popper</a> and a <a href="http://www.littletikes.com/toyfinder/default.asp?URL=/toyfinder/products.asp?category=3&C=CAT">big yellow truck</a>, both of which
she has coveted at playgroup.
</p><p>
She's pretty happy with her presents; the Duplo especially is fun for pulling
apart and flinging about.
-->
</p>
<p>
This Monday was her one-year checkup, to be examined and 
jabbed with a million tiny needles.  Well, three, but it seemed like more.
She got the usual MMR plus Varivax for chicken pox and
Menjugate for meningitis.  The two latter shots were not covered by
OHIP so we had to pay for them to the tune of over $200, which was
a bit of a shock.  Hopefully Blake's insurance will cover them.  
Ironically yesterday afternoon the government announced that they will cover
those two vaccines in the future.
</p>
<p>
She was weighed and measured, and found wanting (God, that was
a bad movie!) -- 22 lbs and 30" which are a little lower than perhaps 
they should be according to her growth curve.  The doctor wasn't sure
if that's just her normal curve or if indeed she isn't growing as she
should be, but she encouraged me to feed her more.  I hadn't been giving
her snacks -- coming up with three nutritious, interesting meals a day
is hard enough -- but I'm starting now.  I picked up a bunch of meal
plans from various daycares at a daycare and pre-school expo a couple 
of weeks ago; they're meant to assure you that your kid is being fed
properly while they're in care, but I'm not above stealing their ideas.
</p>
<p>
When I got home from the doctor feeling somewhat chagrined that I am not
feeding my baby properly, I found in a mailbox a big blue envelope 
addressed in my brother's beloved chicken-scratchings.  He sent a card and
a gift card for Indigo for Delphine.  I opened the card and bawled my face
off for a few minutes; it was one of those times when you've been needing to
cry for a day or two and then something innocent sets you off.  I just
pictured my little Dave in front of a rack of cards picking one out for
Delphine and he's SO SWEET!  I'm a mess.
</p>
<p>
I love that Dave sent her a bookstore gift certificate.  For one thing
I've been wanting to get her some more books but just haven't had the
ready cash to do so, but also Dave and I always, always, always get a book for
birthdays.  Always have, always will.  It's good to continue that tradition,
especially since Blake and I totally dropped the ball.  (We only budgeted
$30 for Del's birthday, which clearly isn't going to be enough, since
kids books are around $15 which leaves a measly $15 for a present.
Argh. Hopefully we'll have more income next year and we can loosen up
the budget a little.)
</p>
<p>
What's the little monster up to, you ask?  Well, she's amazing. I feel
like I've fallen in love with her all over again in the last few days,
like I have a big old crush on her.  I suspect this crushing will come
and go over the next... oh, hell, for the rest of my life, probably.
</p>
<p>
She's almost walking; she can stand unassisted for a few seconds, and
she walks with her little pushy wagon thing my parents sent her for
Christmas.  I don't think she's really keen to walk because she can get
where she wants to go crawling.  She does love to climb, though; she
climbs onto chairs and toys and the <a href="http://baby.latte.ca/pics/2004/0511/24-w-climber.JPG">aforementioned pushy thing</a>.  She climbs the
stairs to the slide at the park, and then slides down feet-first, 
tummy down.  Then she climbs up the slide, which is varyingly effective
depending how much clothing she's wearing.
</p>
<p>
The climbing is alarming because it makes me realize how much trouble
she could get into, between falling and getting into stuff she's not
supposed to get into.  Toddler-proofing is going to be way harder than
baby-proofing.
</p>
<p>
She's not showing any signs of talking, although she's got a good repertoire
of phonemes.  She doesn't understand any words, apart from her name and
"No".  This is perhaps a little delayed, but still within normal parameters.
I feel like I am expected to worry about that, but I'm not worried.
I'm glad she's not a tiny prodigy; I don't want her to be
special, I just want her to be happy.  Dave and I were special when we were
kids, and I don't think it bought us much happiness.
</p>
<p>
And all in all she <em>is</em> happy and well and lovely.  
People still comment on how
well-behaved she is, and how pretty, and I tend to agree.
