Yes, poor Delphine hasn't been getting much screen time here, we're
too busy with the baby and books and unsolicited advice.  But she's
still here, very much so.
</p>
<p>
Delphine is...  funny.  Delphine likes to pretend.  When she pretends
to do something, like open a pretend suitcase or put on a pretend
boot, she makes a "shhhick" noise, her own all-purpose sound effect.
(She learned that from her Daddy, the master of sound effects.)
</p>
<p>
The other day Delphine and Daddy were going to the pretend beach,
and Daddy had to put on a pretend wetsuit, so Delphine helped. 
She pulled it up over his legs and arms and zipped the pretend
zip up the front.  Then Daddy had to put on a pretend sunhat; 
Delphine patted it around his head as if she were encasing him
in playdough, and then, with a flourish, tied it under his chin with a
huge, pretend bow.  It was at that point that I bust
a gut laughing; Delphine didn't see the humour, and so left the
room.  Blake asked "Where are you going?"
</p>
<p>
"To the swimming pool."  
</p>
<p>
"Should I swim to the pool with you?" 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah."
</p>
<p>
So Blake did <em>the worm</em> out of
the room, oscillating along the floor.  I think I actually 
died from laughing and I'm typing
this from the afterlife.  Kids are funny, and if your husband
happens to be funny too, you've hit the jackpot.  (Even if
no-one else thinks he's funny, it still counts.)
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
Delphine's into fairy tales.  She likes "Goldilocks", "The Three
Little Pigs", "Little Red Riding Hood", "Henny Penny" and "The 
Three Billy Goats Gruff".  Reading fairy tales to her has made me
realize how common fairy tale references are; they're everywhere.
I am so pleased and excited to be introducing her to this piece
of our culture. This is why I became a mother: I get such pleasure
from reading, from knowing about things, from recognizing things
in unexpected places, from putting ideas together, 
from intellectual life in general, and I am so keen to share 
that with my children.  I guess this is why athletic types like
to take their kids out to play ball and stuff, and why it's so
purturbing to have a child who doesn't share your way of
thinking.
</p>
<p>
We've also started reading Dennis Lee poems, and she has a 
few of them memorized.  "Mumbo, Jumbo, Christopher Columbo,
sitting on the sidewalk chewing bubble gumbo; I think I catch
a WHALE; I think I'll catch a snail; I think I'll sit around
a while, chewing bubble gumbo."  It's nice to have these
things in your head so you have something to say
to yourself while you're, you know, in the shower or walking
around.  She has an uncanny recall for text and poems; yesterday
I caught her reciting entire paragraphs of "Henny Penny" to 
herself.  I don't know if that's unusual or just part of the
incredible learning machine that is a little kid's brain.
</p>
<p>
But I'm glad to be filling it with these things; what do kids
who aren't read to talk about to themselves?
</p>
<p>
She's about, oh, eighty percent potty trained.  How did we do
it?  I don't really know.  We read lots of books about it, 
and talked about it a lot, and worried about 
it a lot, but we didn't reward her or coax her (much).  In the
end she has almost potty trained herself, just like the books
said she would.  
</p>
<p>
She still chooses to wear pull-ups some days,
but she always poops in the toilet, and when she pees in her
diaper it's because she has decided to do so.  How do I know?
Because she tells me about it.  "Do we pee in diapers?"  "Yeah,
you can pee in your diaper.  Do you want to go pee in the toilet?"
"No, I will pee in my diaper."  Waits...  "I need a new diaper."
Fortunately she can change her own diaper now.  Hooray for
pull-ups!
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, according to that history of childcare book I read,
apparently the potty training of Louis the somethingth of France
started when he was eighteen months, and ended when he was around
three, so this timetable for toileting isn't some product of our
degenerate times and diaper companies;  it's just when the brain
is ready.  (Although I still think you can train, in the Pavlovian
sense, your baby or young toddler to go in the potty if you work on
it.)
</p>
<p>
What else?  She dresses herself, although not usually as promptly
as I would like her to.  She loves to wear her yellow rain jacket
and gets very angry when she has to wear her snowsuit instead.
She eats, but not very much, and I am afraid I don't make fruit
and vegetables enough of a priority.  When you only eat (apparently)
half a cup of food a day, it's easy to fill yourself up with meat
and bread.  I am trying harder.
</p>
<p>
This weekend we had our first bona fide scary toddler-running-into-traffic
moment (and hopefully our last).  There wasn't really any traffic, it
was a little tiny street next to a park and there weren't any cars on
it, but it was still very bad and there was angriness and a stern 
talking to.  What happened was that she was wandering around the park
with a friend, and neither she nor her friend were responding to 
me or the friend's mother calling their names.  They got a little too
far away from us and too close to the street, and just wandered out
between the parked cars.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure whether,
at this age, I should expect her to respond to verbal commands (and
I have just failed to instill that in her), or
whether she's still young enough that I need to stay close
and keep control over her physically.  Either way, I will definitely 
stay closer to her from now on, in potentially alarming situations
like that.

This morning Delphine slept late, and she was in an exceptionally chatty
mood when she woke up.  She came into bed with farting on the mind,
and asked,
</p>
<p>
"Who farted?"
</p>
<p>
"I don't know," I said, "who?"
</p>
<p>
"I think Zaida farted."
</p>
<p>
"Yeah?"

"Zaida has a big white moustache.  And hair.  His hair
match his moustache."  A pause.  "Zaida is very old."

How many times have I publically declared that we will start
potty training TOMORROW here?  Three?  Four?  Guess what we
still haven't done?  
</p>
<p>
I think I have overloaded myself with information on this
matter because I flip-flop, literally every day, between
(in a deep, gruff voice) Being The Boss and telling 
Delphine it's time to start using the potty, or (in a
light, floaty, slightly mocking voice) Waiting until She
Is Ready.  The consensus in modern theory seems to lean
towards letting her decide, with vague handwaving talk of
Negative Consequences if I force the issue.  At this point
I am leaning towards going with the consensus on the 
basis that if it turns out to be the wrong decision I
can pull out the "everyone was doing it" defense.  That's
not a defense I have a lot of respect for, though.
</p>
<p>
This is complicated and irritated by the fact that Delphine
has decided to stop pooping.  Pooping is unpleasant and
smelly and generally beneath someone such as her.  However 
her body didn't get the memo, so at around 4:00 every day
(her body would like to be regular) I am faced with a two-year-old
frantically waddling around, penguin-style, moaning "My
bum hurts!  My bum is sore!"  Every third day or so her
body wins.
</p>
<p>
Altogether this means I am spending much more time than
I would like to thinking about, talking about, and
reading about poop.  (Did you know Everybody Poops?  I
have a book that says so.)  I am done.  I need a poop
holiday.
</p>
<p>
Everything else is going okay, though.  We are reading
more and more meaty books (I even got a picture-book
version of <em>The Secret Garden</em>!) together.  
We just discovered Curious George, which I don't remember
reading as a kid but quite like now.  I gather there is
a movie coming out -- we will be sure not to go.  (I think
two-and-a-half is too young to sit through a whole movie.
She can hardly pay attention through a 20-minute Baby
Einstein DVD.) 
</p>
<p>
We still don't watch much TV with her.  She gets one or two
20 minute DVDs a week, and we almost always watch with her.
Actually, she watched TV by herself for the first time 
yesterday, while I did a Grocery Gateway order.  I felt
strangely neglectful and inclined to crack open a can of
cheap beer and light a cigarette.
</p>
<p>
(Actually I think I might buy some beer this weekend.  Maybe
some popcorn too.)
</p>
<p>
She has lots of dollies now: a Cabbage Patch baby named Phoebe 
from Baba, 
a homemade rag doll (with no fixed name that I can ascertain)
from my mother, and her first dolly, a
rag doll named Boy which Auntie J'Anne gave her.  
She also has a variety of stuffed animals, which rotate in
and out of her favour.  My favourite is a purple and orange
orangutan-type thing named George.  She likes 
to put her babies to sleep, and push them around in her push cart,
and generally leave them underfoot for me to step on and 
swear.  (I am turning into my mother.)  Phoebe and the rag
doll are both naked at all times, as were my dolls when I
was a child.  The only reason Boy has clothes is that they 
are stitched on.
</p>
<p>
She also likes to play with the Fisher-Price Little People
house I got her for Christmas, and to draw and colour.  Her
drawings are getting more representational, they are no
longer just scribbles.  Now they're circles and lines which
are arbitrarily (probably not to her) assigned meaning: this
blob with lines coming out is a mouse, and this smaller blob
is a banana.  She likes to help in the kitchen too; she stirs
things.  That's about all I let her do so far, since she's
clearly too young for fire and sharp things.
</p>
<p>
She's cute; she's lovely; she's funny and interesting and I
like her very much.

Delphine is going through changes:  she's gradually 
transforming from an obstinate and contrary two to a 
considerate and obedient three.  She no longer says "No!"
automatically.  She wants to please: when she is misbehaving
and Blake or I am annoyed she asks "Are you
happy?"; the two-year-old 
sometimes wins out, though:  "Are you happy?"  "No, Delphine,
I'm not happy."  "Yes!  You're happy!"
</p>
<p>
On Thursday she suddenly started asking "Why?", and it's a
favourite conversational gambit now.  It makes a pleasant 
change from "No".
</p>
<p>
She makes me laugh all the time. The other day as I was getting dressed I put a couple of
breast pads on the bed.  Delphine seized them and trotted
away, saying "I need pads because my boobies are dripping",
and clutched them to her little proto-boobs.  
</p>
<p>
Sometimes she doesn't like being laughed at, especially
when she's angry.  So she says "Don't laugh!", except
it comes out "Don' yaff!"  Which of course makes me 
yaff all the more.  Poor thing.
</p>
<p>
We haven't got anywhere with potty training; I was going
to put her in big girl pants this weekend because Blake's
got some time off, but I haven't yet.  It just seems like
a lot of work.  News at 11!  Parenting hard!  I have to get
on with it, though, because Delphine's totally ready.  She
spends ages making her Little People go to the bathroom
in her new Little People house.  All they seem to do is take
turns peeing, complete with pulling down of pants, and wiping
with toilet paper and washing hands.  She declares "I have
to pee" often.  The only thing she doesn't do is actually
use the toilet, and I figure that's only because so far she
hasn't had to.  A couple of accidents might convince her to
figure it out.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow.  I swear we will start tomorrow.

We're reading <em>Franklin Rides a Bike</em>.  It's all about how 
practicing at stuff makes you better (a lesson, incidentally,
that I didn't learn until I got to university, and then it was
only when I noticed how much better my typing was after spending
so much time on alt.kids-talk.  But I digress.)  <em>Franklin
Rides A Bike</em> says "Fox tried and
tried [to hit a baseball], and one day, he hit a home run!"
</p>
<p>
Delphine:  And who else hit a home run?<br>
Me: I don't know, who else?  Delphine?<br>
Delphine: Yeah.  And Mummy!  And Cordelia!<br>
Me: Did Zaida hit a home run?<br>
Delphine, in the tone of one speaking to the village idiot: No!
Zaida's a boy!
</p>
<p>
Huh.  I wish I could get into her head and figure out what
she thinks a home run is.
</p>

<hr width="40%">
<p>
Delphine can't pronounce "l"s.  It's not a big deal -- you're not
supposed to be able to pronounce everything until you're five.
But it gives her a unique accent, and I am always interested to
see what she substitutes for L.  Franklin is "Frankwin".  "Mary
had a little lamb" is "Mary had a yittle yamb".  And Cordelia
is just "Cordeeya", with a long Italian-style double-e.
</p>
<p>
I think she also uses "f" instead of "th", but I am so used to her
accent that I don't really notice.  (This happens to me a lot -- I
will get so used to mentally translating accents that I forget 
people have them.  I'm especially good at Chinese accents, but
it kind of blew my mind when I talked to a Chinese guy in England,
at my last job.  Instead of having a Canadian Chinese accent
he had an English Chinese accent.  It took me a few seconds
to recalibrate my accent filter and figure out what he was
saying.)

Delphine and I were drawing, and I had drawn her a spider.  She told me
to give him a crayon, so I drew a purple crayon.  Then she asked me 
to draw him a hand (to hold the crayon with), which I did.  Then I
said "Should I give him a hat?" 
</p>
<p>
She said, "No, he is not going outside."
</p>
<p>
Okay, then.
</p>
<hr width="20%">
<p>
We went to the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair last weekend, and we
brought back a block of fudge.  The next day I gave a little piece
to Delphine.  She asked "Is it from the fair?"  I said yes.  
</p>
<p>
"Thank you fair!"
</p>
<hr width="20%">
<p>
I was folding laundry and every so often I would ask Delphine what
something was.  (Life is one big pop quiz when you're a toddler.)
I held up a pair of Blake's underwear and said "What's this?"
</p>
<p>
"Daddy's big-girl pants."
</p>
<hr width="20%">
<p>
We were reading nursery rhymes, and I started reading one out.  Delphine
said "No, no, Mummy, that's my!"  ("My" is "mine".)  And then she
read it out.  After she was done I turned the page and said "Do you
want to do this one too?"
</p>
<p>
"No, you can do it.  It's not hard."
</p>
<p>
Thanks.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
She's such a little person.  She is taking really well to the baby;
she comforts her ("It's okay, baby, you don't have to cry.") and tucks
blankets around her and stuffs the soother in her mouth (whether she
wants it or not) and wants me to help her when she cries. 
</p>
<p>
Today Blake took the day off (because he is a good husband.  Delphine
was only in daycare one day this week, and Blake has only been back at
work for a couple of weeks so he knew that I was kind of overwhelmed
by the idea of four days this week with both girls, so he took the day
off today.  He doesn't bring me flowers or take me out to fancy dinners,
but stuff like that is so much better.) and we played. Delphine and I
made pancakes (she is a top-notch stirrer) for breakfast, and then we
went down to the playground at the school.  Blake and Delphine ran around
and climbed stuff while I watched and held Cordelia.  Then we came home
for hot chocolate and Jamaican patties, then a nap.  
</p>
<p>
After naptime we played with Cordelia (Delphine blanketed and de-blanketed
her about twenty times) and went out for coffee, and ate the rest of
Delphine's Hallowe'en candy (she did not share).  She played some games
with her new flower toys, who are called Baba and Zeyda, and looked out
the window.  ("The clouds are pink, and white.  There is water in the
sky.  Daddy!  There is water in the sky.")
</p>
<p>
Then there was more patty, and Baba and Zeyda (the real ones) came over
to pick Delphine up for her sleepover, which might just be a regular
Friday thing.  It was such a nice, easy, sweet day.  The kind of day
you imagine when you picture yourself with kids.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
We are poking gingerly at the idea of potty training.  Delphine is
so conflicted between being a big girl with big girl pants, and being
a little baby in diapers like Cordelia.  It's painful to watch.  We
put her in pull-ups today but the experiment failed dismally; it's
obvious she's not really ready.  Fortunately they don't seem to mind
changing diapers at daycare, even though she has moved to the preschool
room.  
</p>
<p>
I have a three-pronged plan of attack to get her out of diapers: 
First, I am going to help her practice
getting to the potty (I think "run to the potty!" sounds like a fun
game) and taking off her pants.  Second, I'm going to try getting her
to sit on the potty several times a day.  Finally, I think I will also switch
her back to cloth diapers.  I'm getting sick of paying for disposable,
and I think they will help her (and me) figure out when she has peed.
Hopefully between that and the fact that all the kids in the preschool
room are potty trained, she will soon be using the potty for herself, 
but if not I will launch a more intensive campaign in January, after
the new baby/Christmas upheaval is over.  Because what the hell else
is there to do in January?

Delphine is almost two and a half.  Today was her first day in the
preschool room at daycare, so she has gone from being one of the
oldest and most senior to being the youngest and not knowing what
the hell is going on.  It will prepare her for many more instances
of the same transition.
</p>
<p>
It was a little sad dropping her off this morning.  I couldn't
help looking at it from her eyes; the preschool room is bigger
than the toddler room, the furniture is bigger, the other kids
are bigger and louder and there are more of them, and she doesn't 
know anyone.
It was all a little overwhelming and scary and I felt bad
for her.  It's hard not to want to protect her from any scary
situation, even though I know she is going to have to learn to
deal with life sooner or later.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately some kids she knew from the toddler room who had
graduated earlier showed up, and she got comfortable.  When
we went to pick her up she was sitting in a circle being read
to, which is about her favourite thing.  Also she got 
Hallowe'en goody bags from the toddler room <em>and</em> the
preschool room, because she spent part of the day back in
toddlers as part of the transition process.  Score!
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
Delphine is taking to Cordelia very well.  She likes to touch
her and kiss her, and when Cordelia cries Delphine likes to
know why, and to help take care of her.  This morning we were
all sitting on the floor reading a book, and I decided to nurse
Cordelia.  As soon as I started Delphine went and got us a pillow,
which is what Blake usually does.
</p>
<p>
She is a little jealous, especially when the baby gets to go in
the sling or the carrier, but she never takes it out on the baby.
She takes it out on us with the whining!  And the carrying on!
A two-year-old with something to whine about is like a dog with
a bone.
</p>
<p>
We're starting to work on discipline, which in our case generally
means "getting her to pick stuff up".  She's a great one for 
dropping things on the ground wherever they happened to lose
her interest, and between the baby and my bad back I am not much
inclined to pick up her trail all day.  Unfortunately neither is
she.  I haven't had a great deal of luck getting her to obey me
when I tell her to pick things up, but I am trying to be consistent
and get down to her level and "help" her pick things up and so on.
</p>
<p>
This seems to be her personal battle; I have been able to institute
other rules, like "give me your jacket when we get home" and 
"don't get down from the table unless you are done eating" pretty
successfully.
</p>
<p>
What else?  She's really verbal -- she talks in whole sentences
and constructs new words and new phrases using the rules she has
already learned.  It's cool!  I can have conversations with her.
She still refers to herself in the third person interrogative, 
though; she says "are you hungry?" when she is hungry.  I'm not
sure whether to go along with it or to pretend I don't know what
she means and take her literally to force her to use the correct
grammar.  I am leaning towards the former, though; she knows I
know what she means, so it's kind of patronizing to pretend I don't.
And she will figure out how to communicate properly sooner or
later; it's what she's hardwired to do.

Delphine is twenty six months old (or thereabouts) and all seems to be
well.  She talks in full sentences, and occasionally  they are gramatically
perfect, which is a bit of a thrill.  
</p>
<p>
She's still in daycare, three days a week.  She is quite stuck on
one of the other kids there, a little boy named Antonio.  She has
taught herself to jump two-footed, and when she does it she  says
"Are you jumping like Antonio?"  (She communicates a lot in rhetorical 
questions.)  And whenever we talk about daycare, Antonio's name
is always the first to come up.  "Who did you see at daycare?"
"Antonio."  "Who is going to be at daycare today?  "Antonio."
Antonio is a very boisterous and energetic little boy, kind of 
the alpha male of daycare, and I don't know if he holds her in 
the same regard, but I don't think she really cares.
</p>
<p>
Her latest literary love is Franklin the Turtle.  My dad sent her a 
couple of Franklin books for her birthday.  I was a little skeptical
at first because they are pretty wordy - several paragraphs - and they 
are just prose, not rhyme.  But she sits through them and asks for them
again and again.  We also go back to the usual favourites all the
time; "One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish",  "Each Peach Pear Plum", 
and lots of nursery rhymes.
</p>
<p>
We haven't really started potty training in earnest.  I'm hoping it
will just happen all by itself.  We have a potty, and sometimes she
sits on it, but never for long enough for a result.  They also
encourage her to sit on the toilet at daycare (they have the cutest
little toddler sized toilets), so I'm hoping one day soon something
will happen.  Antonio is close to being potty trained; maybe that
will help.
</p>
<p>
We're having trouble with sleep; for the last week (or two?) she
has been resisting going to bed, and crying for ages before finally
sleeping.  We have been going in to see her intermittently. She always
has a raft of byzantine demands; a different blanket, Boy (her doll)
in the crib, Boy out of the crib, a kleenex, and so on.  Clearly she
is just stalling, and it was working really well for her; lots
of attention and extra time with Mummy and Daddy..  
</p>
<p>
But I got
Weissbluth's "Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child" out of the library
again and having re-read the first few chapters, I think that she is
probably sleep-deprived because we moved her bedtime later a few weeks
ago. (In addition to the trouble sleeping, she has also been acting
very two-ish in the afternoons and evenings -- very contrary and 
tantrumy and generally not like herself at all.)
</p>
<p>
So we are going to move her bedtime back up to 6:30 or 6:00
(even though I have no idea how we're going to make it work with our
schedules) and starting tomorrow we will let her cry herself to sleep
instead of going in every few minutes.  It's mean but it works.
I was going to start today, but Blake thought it would be nicer to
go in one last time and explain to her that he wasn't going to come back,
and she should just go to sleep.  Sure enough, she didn't cry after that,
so maybe the same thing will work tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
So, in general, she is getting smarter, and I think prettier, and 
definitely taller. I think my very favourite thing is when Blake brings
her into the bedroom first thing in the morning, and she says
"Hi Mummy!" and we cuddle and read books.
