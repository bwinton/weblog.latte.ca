    <p>Delphine (still) asks us why a lot.  Sadly, sometimes I don't have a
good answer, which sort of led to the conversation we had this
afternoon.<br><br>
[First scene.  Two cactuses are dancing.]<br>
Delphine: "Why are the cactuses?"<br>
Me: "Well, uh, they just are.  Questions about why a thing is don't really
have answers."<br><br>
[Next scene.  A goat has paint on himself.]<br>
Delphine: "Why is he dirty?"<br>
Me: "..."<br>
Delphine: "He's dirty cause he was painting."<br></p>
<p>So, I guess some questions about why a thing is something are easy to
answer but some questions about why a thing is something have no good
answer.  Can anyone tell me what the difference between the questions
is, and how to explain it to a three-year-old without using words like
"intrinsic", or "just because"?</p>

Yesterday Delphine and Cordelia and I went out to run some errands.
On the way home Delphine said, "Do you remember the Vikings?  In 
Daddy's movie?"
</p>
<p>
I didn't remember, but she went on to tell me the story of the 
Vikings, most of which I missed but which ended with "They went
home.  The end."  
</p>
<p>
Then she decided she was going to be a Viking, so she put on her
imaginary
Viking helmet and charged around happily shouting "Vike!  Vike!
Vike!"

    <h4>Power</h4>
<p>
We installed new compact fluorescents in the bathroom
because the government told us to.  Delphine, of course,
doesn't miss a trick, and she said,
</p>
<p>
"It's all white!"
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, we changed the light bulbs."
</p>
<p>
"Why?"
</p>
<p>
"These ones use less power."
</p>
<p>
"Power like the genie [from Aladdin]?"  
</p>
<p>
Okay, that's not particularly funny, I just love to
watch her learn these new concepts and piece together
the world.  And her perspective makes me think; is 
electric power the same as genie power?  
</p>
<p>
We're also working on homonyms (not really working
on, I just happened to get a book called <em>Did You
Say Pears?</em> by Arlene Alda out of the library,
and it is about homonyms and homophones, so she's had
them on her mind lately), and the other day she 
said "There are two mangoes!  Mango the colour,
and mango the fruit!"  And I wasn't sure whether
to correct her or not; it's not exactly a homophone
because the two words are obviously related, but I
hate to split hairs with her on something so esoteric.
She's three!
</p>
<h4>Poop</h4>
<p>
Today we had everyone over for dinner.  After we were
all finished eating Delphine decided she had to use
the facilities, which are unfortunately right next
to the dining area, and she still does all her business
with the door open.  So she did her thing, which
of course turned out to be pretty noisy, and we all
laughed.
</p>
<p>
"Are you laughing at me?  I just farted!"
</p>
<p>
"Farts are funny," I said, which provoked a short
discussion about why it's not funny when Zaida farts.
I said we're laughing on the inside.
</p>
<p>
Then Delphine said "I have lots of farts.  I'm 
full of farts!"
</p>
<p>
And then she got off the toilet and assumed the
"please wipe my bum" position so I had to excuse myself
and take care of her business while trying not to 
pee myself laughing.  Ah, parenthood.

My daughter the goth: "I like to be dead."  She talks about
being dead a lot, but I don't think it means what she thinks
it means, because apparently it can be cured by eating corn.

My daughter the... I don't even know if there is a word
for this.  We were reading a book with a picture of
a skeleton, and Delphine said, "I have a penis."  
Me: "Really?"  "Yes.  It's in my bum.  It's a bone. 
Seth said I do."  (Seth is this really sweet tiny

a fair bit of misinformation around here.)

I mentioned in a previous post that Delphine likes to
postpone the actual sleep part of bedtime by coming
up with ingenius time-wasting requests.  I will be
sitting in the living room and I will hear the quiet
click of the bedroom door opening, and Delphine will
emerge in her adorable pajamas and look at me with
improbably large eyes and say "Mummy..."  I regard 
her seriously, and after a moment of silence I say
"Yes?"
</p>
<p>
And she says "I need another buddy."  Or, "I need cold
fresh water."  Or, "I need a
cuddle."  And today, the best yet,
</p>
<p>
"Can I be a juggler?"
</p>
<p>
I took a deep breath, tried not to laugh:  
"Yes, when you grow up you can be a juggler, but
right now you have to go to sleep."
</p>
<p>
And she solemnly turned around and climbed back 
into bed.

Delphine is seldom Delphine.  Sometimes she's Pooh, and I'm
Piglet.  Sometimes she's the mummy, and I'm the baby.
Sometimes she's Ursa, and I'm Delphine.  Sometimes I am
Stella and she's Sam, and sometimes I am Sam and she's
Stella.  Lately, she has been Corduroy and I have been
Lisa.
</p>
<p>
She has a tremendous imagination.  Today she pretended
a calendar on the wall was a baby, and she was rocking
it to sleep.  Any pair of things where one is bigger
than the other become a mummy and baby: "Mummy spoon, 
mummy spoon, I am sad!  Want up mummy spoon!"  And
she holds the baby spoon approximately halfway up the
mummy spoon.  
</p>
<p>
Yesterday she and Blake were playing with balls, and
they held them on their heads and Delphine said
"Look Mummy!  We got two heads!"
</p>
<p>
It's so much fun being along for the ride with her
amazing little brain.

Today Delphine is at daycare.  Blake is in Montreal on 
business so to lighten my load, my in-laws took 
Delphine for a sleep-over last night.  She was
really excited to go:  "Can I sleep in the crib?"
They have a Pack n' Play and Delphine still loves
to sleep in it even though she can't stretch out
in it any more.  This afternoon I will go and pick
her up from daycare at around 4:30; when I get there
Cordelia will be mobbed by all the little children
who are not lucky enough to have a baby sister, and
Delphine will play it cool, walking away from me
and finding something else to do.  After a few
minutes she will come back and show me what she
is doing, and then she will say "Wanna go home."
And we will walk around the corner and down the
block, stopping to examine an ant or some broken
glass, and to step up onto the entrance at Pizza
Pizza.
</p>
<p>
She's good company these days.  She is hardly
ever arbitrarily defiant any more; mostly she
is compliant and friendly, and if she isn't it's
because she's tired or hungry or she wants to
wrest your attention away from Cordelia.
</p>
<p>
I'm feeling a little sad lately because we
don't read as much as we used to, because of 
Cordelia.  I used to literally sit and read to
her for an hour or more, but Cordelia isn't 
old enough to sit and be read to yet, so she
comes and crawls all over us and pulls the book
away and is generally a nuisance.  I try and read
to Delphine while Cordelia is napping, but I
also have to fit in sundry housework in the 
hour she's asleep, so we usually don't get 
through more than a couple of books.  I hope
once Cordelia is old enough to be read to
properly we can go back to our old habits.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia is, unfortunately for Delphine, at that
Godzilla stage where she lumbers around the
house destroying things because that is all
she is capable of; she pulls books off shelves
and bends them and mouths them, she overturns 
towers of blocks and deranges puzzles.  As
an adult I can accept this, knowing it is
temporary, and I can move my precious things
to high places, but Delphine can't.  She's 
stuck down there at Cordelia's level and
she doesn't appreciate my "she's just a baby"
excuses.  I wish Delphine had her own room
where she could keep things, but for now she
is just going to have to suck it up.  I suppose
it will build character.  In a way it's nice
that she gets to go to daycare and be free
of the barbarian horde for a few hours.
</p>
<p>
Other than those unfortunate incidents, 
Delphine gets along quite well with Cordelia.
She knows that you are not supposed to snatch
toys from her, that if she has something you
want you have to find something else for her
to play with in exchange.  She shares her
food with Cordelia and she knows to ask what
babies can have.  She knows to be quiet when
Cordelia is sleeping.  She likes to make
Cordelia laugh.  She is a good big sister.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
They have this chart of verbal development
which tell you when you should worry -- say,
if your three-year-old isn't forming sentences
or if your one-and-a-half-year-old doesn't
say five words or something.  The chart goes
up to age five and apparently if Delphine were
five, we wouldn't need to worry about her verbal
development.  She knows colours, she asks the
meaning of words, she counts to ten, she knows
all the nursery rhymes.  She knows nursery
rhymes you haven't even heard of.  
</p>
<p>
She's starting to show signs of literacy;
she knows that letters are associated with 
sounds, and she has started asking "what does
that say" when we read books.  She can recognize
some words, although I am still not sure if it
is recognition of the word or just remembering
what that particular instance of that particular
word is.  I mean, we were reading an Eric Carle
book and I pointed to the word "Eric" and asked
her what it was.  She got it right, but did she
recognize the word "Eric" or did she remember it
was "Eric" from the last time we read the same
book?  Either way it's a step in the right
direction; all we need to do now is teach her
the <em>correct</em> spelling for "Erik".
</p>
<p>
I feel like I am being too braggy and I should try
and think of something bad to say about Delphine,
but I am not trying to brag.  I just really
like her.

Delphine just turned three.  We went out to visit my parents
in Saskatchewan for her birthday, and they furnished a suitable
amount of cake, candles, fancy decorations and presents to
satisfy her little self.  We had a nice time.
</p>
<p>
We went to the doctor this morning for Delphine's three year
checkup.  She was a little nervous, but it turned out she
didn't get any shots, so that wasn't so bad.  She lay down
on the examination table properly, opened her mouth nice 
and wide,
and let the doctor check out all her vitals.  Generally she
is doing fine, although a little small for her age -- 
around the 40th percentile for height and a little lower 
for weight.  We're not concerned about it because she 
eats well, but we'll do the measurements again at 
3 and a half, just in case there is something up so 
we can catch it early.
</p>
<p>
And Cordelia is awake.  Thus ends the blogging for this
month...
