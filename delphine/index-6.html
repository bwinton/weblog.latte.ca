    <p>The birth story of
<a href="http://mike.reed.org/archives/journal/Sept02/090902.html">Rosalind 
Yates Reed</a> is great.  It was a natural birth, and for a while
there it sounds like it was a real pain in the ass, dragging on
and on.  But the point is that they got through it by trying a
whole lot of different things, and they didn't go for any of the
standard hospital interventions.  
</p>
<p>
I'm having trouble expressing why this story made such an impression
on me.  I guess it's because the labour was long and hard, but they
stuck to their principles and kept trying lots of different things
to move the labour along.  So often I get the message that you can
only have a natural birth if your labour is easy and progresses well.

Delphine: Is the tooth fairy real?<br>
Me: What do you think?<br>
D: I think she is real.<br>
Me: Why?<br>
D: She has wings, and wings are real, so she is real.
</p>
<p>
Kind of hard to argue with that, but I tried it anyway.
</p>
<p>
Me: Are fairies real?<br>
D: No.<br>
Me: Is the tooth fairy a fairy?<br>
D: Yeah.<br>
Me: So if fairies are real, and the tooth fairy is a fairy,
how can she be real?<br>
D: She's sort of... in between.<br>
Me: In between real and not real?<br>
D: Uh, in between a fairy and real.

She has also taken to saying "Let's run along, and not get into

We signed Delphine up for Kindergarten, to start in fall.
She's actually ready to start tomorrow -- she can dress herself
and write her name and go to the bathroom by herself -- but because 
her birthday is fairly early in the year she will be one of 
the older, more accomplished students in her class.  Fortunately
it's a mixed Junior/Senior Kindergarten class so if necessary
she can mingle with the five-year-olds, although by the time
<em>she</em> gets to SK she will be like Methuselah.  
</p>
<p>
I wonder about
skipping her to first grade a year early; I don't know if they
are keen on skipping grades in the Toronto school board, but
it seems that if you're going to do it, earlier would be
better than later, no?  But just proposing that makes me 
feel like one of those annoying "my kid is so wonderful
and smart and she needs special attention" parents.  But
honestly, if she is ready for grade one after a year of
kindergarten -- and I'm not saying she will be -- doesn't
it make sense to put her in it?
</p>
<p>
Speaking of people who think their kids are so special,
Dooce (who I normally love) wrote this in her monthly
letter to Leta, with respect to a question on a preschool
application form: "whoever gets to spend their days with 
you will be transformed by the experience, and that the 
only right answer would be: You will not be disappointed."
Seriously?  You know these people, preschool teachers, get
to meet hundreds of little kids, right?  You think your
little precious is going to be the one who transforms them?
Why?  What exactly about your kid is so special?  Is she
the reincarnation of Mother Theresa?  No, she's just 
another snotty, screaming, whining, pooping three-year-old,
just like mine and every other on the planet.
</p>
<p>
Having said that ("screaming, whining"), Delphine and I
are getting better at communicating with each other. I
read Barbara Coloroso's <em>Kids Are Worth It</em>, and
it really helped me figure out a way to talk to her and
deal with her which lets us both keep our dignity intact.
There's a real art to it, the balance between getting her
to do the things I want her to do without forcing her,
or just letting her do whatever she wants to.  I offer
her choices, compromises, I decide <em>what</em> she does and 
she decides <em>how</em>, but all the while I have to
maintain my authority so that when she's running away 
down the sidewalk I can yell "Stop!" and she will do it
right away.
</p>
<p>
Delphine loves a power battle â€” sometimes it seems
like she automatically defies me on everything: "Toast
for breakfast today!"  "I don't like toast!" (An out
and out lie.)  So then it's fun to offer no resistance:
"Okay, no toast for breakfast, let's have cereal!"  "I
want toast!"  Okay, toast it is, crazy kid.  
</p>
<p>
My favourite times are when we get to hang out together
without Cordelia.  Cordelia is still at an age where she
butts into whatever we're doing, but she's too young to
play board games or sit nicely and be read to, so when
we're all together I'm often playing interference, but when
it's just Delphine and I we can talk and read and do
things together like real people.  It doesn't happen very
often, though.

This Saturday Delphine broke a lifelong no-Macdonald's streak
by visiting the place for a friend's birthday party.  The party
was enjoyed by all, and Ursa and her mom joined us for the
bus ride home.
</p>
<p>
On the way, Delphine and Ursa amused us with their knock-knock
jokes:
</p>
<p>
Ursa: Knock knock!<br>
Delphine: Who's there?<br>
U: Orange!<br>
D: Orange who?<br>
U: Orange you glad a banana?
</p>
<p>
And then they laughed.  And then they told it again.  And again.
</p>
<p>
Delphine actually managed to deliver the "anita" knock-knock
joke successfully, but only once.  The second time it went
like this:
</p>
<p>
D: Knock-knock!<br>
U: Who's there?<br>
D: Anita!<br>
U: Anita who?<br>
D: Anita teeth!
</p>
<p>
(Delphine's go-to word when she needs to say something silly
is teeth, pronounced "teef".)
</p>
<p>
And then Ursa said "You need to learn some more jokes!"  Mmm-hmmm!
Anyone know any good knock-knock jokes?

Delphine might be the only three and a half-year-old
in North America who has never seen an entire movie.
This week her Auntie Morgan tried to get her to watch
<em>Finding Nemo</em> but it was too scary for her.
I don't know if they made it all the way to the end,
but they definitely skipped some bits in the middle.
</p>
<p>
Delphine is still on the delicate side of the 
sensitivity scale; she is reserved with new people,
and she doesn't like scary or violent characters
in movies or TV shows.  Books don't bother her so
much; we read her Little Red Riding Hood and Chicken
Little, and she doesn't flinch at the devouring of
grandmothers or the biting off of heads.
</p>
<p>
Once she gets past her initial reservations
she rises to the occasion.  At Hanukkah dinner she
made conversation with Baba's friends, and just last
night she very bravely petted a large, friendly dog.
She can even put her face in the pool for three
seconds!
As long as she gets lots of cuddles and patience she
faces her fears admirably.
</p>
<p>
She is very solicitous of others and loves to be
the mummy.  When I am scared of something, (or pretend
to be) she comes up and pats me and says "It's okay
Mummy, I will protect you."  She has lots of baby
dollies, and she takes great care of them, feeding
them and putting them down for naps.  We all
have to be quiet when they are taking a nap.
</p>
<p>
She gets into these weird proto-Goth funks sometimes,
where she goes all nihilistic:  "I don't want any
toys, I don't want you, I don't want anyfing!  Go
away Mummy!  I want to be sad!"  And then she has
a big cry.  It's almost like she's picking at a
scab, emotionally, like she wants to experience
the pain of sorrow in an environment she has 
created and controls.  I'm never sure what to do
but mostly I let her go through it and just 
stay around to administer cuddles when she's ready
for them.
</p>
<p>
Delphine loves puzzles and
accordingly got a whole pile of them for Christmas.
She's fairly good at them; she needs a little help
the first time through, but  she can usually
do them on her own thereafter.  I am looking forward
to when she's older and we can all do jigsaw
puzzles together properly.  For now they all have to be
done high up on the dining table, out of the reach
of Cordelia the Marauder.
</p>
<p>
Delphine likes sticking stickers, which is like
drawing only not creative.  And she spent literally
hours playing with a pair of paper dress-up dolls
my cousin sent her â€” you know, the ones with
the clothes with little tabs on them?  The old toys
are still the best.
</p>
<p>
Delphine's getting better at reasoning, which means we
have to have airtight reasons when we tell her to
do (or not do) things.  This morning she asked for
a lollipop; I said she shouldn't have candy in the
morning, but somehow she knew I had already had a
cookie.  She reasoned that a cookie
is a treat, and a lollipop is a treat, so she should
be allowed to have a lollipop.  I couldn't really 
argue with that without getting into subtle, and
frankly dubious, arguments like the presence of flour
and egg in cookies rendering them slightly closer
to actual food.  So she got her lollipop.
</p>
<p>
The lollipops, incidentally, were also a gift from my 
cousin.  They are little jellies in the shapes of
Santa and snowmen and stuff, on a lollipop stick.
Delphine is not a chewer of candies, so she sucks
these little jellies and makes them last literally
for hours, which of course drives Cordelia mad 
because she's not allowed to have jelly lollipops
at all.
</p>
<p>
Three and a half is great.  It's a little psychotic
sometimes, but (just like all the other ages) often
because she's tired or hungry.  And mostly it's great;
she can talk, she can think, she can go up and down
stairs by herself, she has friends and ideas and 
opinions.  She's a real person, and I quite like her.

Delphine, being only three and a half, still has lots of those
little kid speech peculiarities which are so adorable that parents
insist on talking about them for years, and even try and teach
them to their grandchildren (ask Blake's father about "meemor" 
and "monsert" some time.  Or don't.)
</p>
<p>
Delphine's most distinctive one is switching consonant sounds
within words, for example "bastick" for "basket", or "bistick"
for "biscuit".  Our doctor's name is Dr Paquette, and Delphine
calls her "Dr Pateck".  Since she also has trouble with the
word "protect" she decided that Dr Pateck is called that because
she patecks us.
</p>
<h4>Delphine Tells A Joke</h4>
<p>
Yesterday Delphine received her first issue of the magazine <em>Chirp</em>,
which is targetted to three- to seven-year-olds.  That's a pretty big
range, so a lot of the magazine is over her head, including the page of
jokes at the end.  I read a couple of riddles to her, but she remained
characteristically stone-faced; however when I read her the knock-knock
joke she laughed.  Encouraged, I read it a couple more times, and then we 
practiced doing it properly, with me taking the lead:
</p>
<p>
"Knock knock!"<br>
"Who's there?"<br>
"Anita!"<br>
"Anita who?"<br>
"Anita cup of hot chocolate!"<br>
Peals of laughter from Delphine.
</p>
<p>
So I thought I would get her to go and tell Daddy the joke as a
surprise.  I coached her a little bit, and sent her off.  
</p>
<p>
Here's
how it went:
"Knock knock!  Who's there?  Daddy!  Daddy who?  Daddy cup of hot
chocolate!"  And she laughed and laughed, and Blake was bewildered.
Still funny, but not in quite the same way.

This year was Delphine's first real Hallowe'en â€” last year we
skipped it altogether because Cordelia was only a month old, and the
year before we dressed Delphine up and dragged her out to a few
friends' houses, but she was tired and not too pleased with all the
strangers.
</p>
<p>
This time she was into it; she dressed as a princess (her idea,
and "coincidentally" her two best friends at daycare were also 
dressed as princesses).  I went all out and bought a fancy 
costume; previously I have sworn that buying costumes is lame,
but since then I have realized that a Hallowe'en
costume doubles as a dress-up toy for year-round play, so it
isn't so ridiculous to spend some money for a quality ensemble.
Plus this will fit her for years: fairy princess, medieval princess,
punk princess (after it starts to get ragged).
</p>
<p>
We started the night at Delphine's friend Ursa's house, where
we were met by their friend Azale (thus completing the trio of
princesses).  We all went out: Delphine, 
Cordelia, Blake and I, Ursa, Ursa's mum, Azale, Azale's mum and
grandmother, and we were joined later by Morgan and Baba.
The girls really got into it (with some coaching: "What do
you say?"  "Trick or treat!"  "What do you say now?"  "Sank you!")
</p>
<p>
We got a good half-grocery-bag full of candy, including some
Lindt squares, two full-sized candy bars (which we had to confiscate
on the grounds that that's far too much chocolate for a three-year-old
â€” for her own good, of course), and some of those fruit bars, 
along with the usual assortment of fun (fun!) sized candy bars, 
Nibs, Tootsie Rolls (does anyone eat them when it's not 
Hallowe'en?), hard candies and Rockets.  
</p>

Delphine was exhausted by the time we got home (but not before
stopping at Starbucks to beg a free kid's hot chocolate with
two helpings of whipped cream and chocolate syrup) so she only  
had a couple of pieces of candy before collapsing.  
</p>
<p>
I had decided that she could have a piece of candy every day
for the month of November, with any leftovers probably going to
Blake's office, but as it turns out she's only asked a couple
of times.  Good thing, too, because Blake and I have been stealing
her loot shamelessly.
</p>
<p>
We also dressed Cordelia up for Hallowe'en; it was Kathryn's idea
to dress her as a garden gnome because of her rosy round cheeks and pointed
ears.  I bought her a red hat and a white beard and she looked adorable, 
but perhaps not surprisingly, she hated the costume.  We got some 
pictures of a very
sad little gnome, which I will post, but we didn't manage to keep 
her suited up long enough to take her out.  That's okay, since she
can't have any candy anyway.

Yesterday I was talking to Auntie Morgan on the telephone.
Delphine wanted to talk to her so I put her on.  They talked
for a while and then Delphine told Morgan about her new
balloon.
</p>
<p>
"It's over there," she pointed.  "I will show it to you."
</p>
<p>
Then she spent some time trying to  figure out how to get
the phone out of the kitchen (where it is attached to the
wall) into the living room where her balloon was.  Finally
I asked her if she would like me to hold the phone for her
while she went to get her balloon.
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, you hold it.  Don't talk though!  Don't talk!
Just hold it!"
</p>
<p>
So Morgan and I had a secret whispered conversation while
Delphine went to retrieve her balloon.  Then after she had
"shown" the balloon to Morgan she started playing with it
and got distracted from her telephone conversation.  After
I said "Don't forget to talk to Auntie Morgan!" a couple
of times, Morgan said "Should we say 'good-bye' now?" and
Delphine said "Bye." and handed the phone back to me.
She's a charmer, that one.
</p>

<p>
She just came running out of the bedroom, said "You're
not my friend, Cordelia," and ran back in.

Blake and I usually tidy up the living room every
night after the girls are in bed, but last night we
were just too tired and couldn't be bothered.  
</p>
<p>
This morning Delphine was appalled when she came
into the living room.
</p>
<p>
"It's so messy!  It was messy ALL NIGHT!  You guys were supposed
to tidy up!"
</p>
<p>
I think 4:30 has just officially become "Tidy-Up 
Time".  "You guys" indeed!
