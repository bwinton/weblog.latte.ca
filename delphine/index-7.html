The other day Delphine peered intently at the world map
we got for my birthday for a while, and then announced
"I read San!  S-a-n is San!"  That's the first word she
has read apart from her name and a few words that she'd
memorized like "o-f-f off" and "n-o no".  And it's in
Spanish!  She's bilingual!
</p>
<p>
Then later she read the first syllable of "Doritos", which
is now that I think about it, faux-Spanish.  I'm going to
assume that's a coincience until I get more data.  Anyway
the point is she's almost reading!  Hooray!

Delphine is four years and five months old, and she just
started Junior Kindergarten.  She's in a mixed JK/SK class
and she loves it.  When people ask if she likes Kindergarten
she says "Fun!"  That seems to take them by surprise.
</p>
<p>
On the first day of Kindergarten Delphine didn't cry or
cling, she marched right in there with, literally, not
a backward glance.  (I actually had to call her back 
for a kiss.)  I guess all that daycare paid off.
</p>
<p>
When I went to pick her up she said "I have
a new best friend!"  When I asked her name, Delphine
didn't know.  Ah well.  It's now a few weeks later and
she knows the names of everyone in her class.  In fact,
the other day we were at the grocery store when some
little boy in a grocery cart said "Hi Delphine!"  It's
really weird when your kid all of a sudden knows people
you have barely heard of, let alone met.
</p>
<p>
It's taking a while for us to get into the new routine
after a long summer of sloth.  Summer was lovely; we
spent our time in the garden, going to the library,
going to music class, watching the deck being built,
sitting on the deck, generally just kicking around.  Delphine 
had so little to do that she spent her time growing:
altogether she has grown four and a half centimeters since
her birthday.  I was measuring her every two weeks!
</p>
<p>
Delphine wants to be a paleontologist.  She is all about dinosaurs
lately; one of the main activities on Thanksgiving was making a
cardboard model of a stegosaurus with Auntie J'Anne.  She knows, well,
plenty of the most popular dinosaurs (your Tyrannosaurus, your
Stegosaurus, your Apatosaurus, your Ankylosaurus, and so on) and the
December 15th re-opening of the dinosaur gallery at the ROM is a
red-letter day in our calendar.  This seems to have ameliorated the
princess thing somewhat, thank heaven.  Now she waffles between
being a fairy princess or being a parasaurolophus for Hallowe'en.
</p>
<p>
Delphine's getting really good at riding her bike.  Not really riding,
of course, she still has training wheels, but she can keep up a pretty
good clip and she doesn't tend to fall over at <em>every</em> curb.  I
don't let her get much practice because I am a mean and lazy mum and I
don't want to bother with carrying a helmet and locking up the bike
and hanging on to her crossing streets while pushing Cordelia, and
stuff.   But somehow she has still managed to improve, and I harbour
hope that she will magically learn to ride safely without any practice
at all.  Or maybe I will get Blake to take her out.
</p>
<p>
Delphine still loves to be read to.  We just bought a whole
pile of Robert Munsch books which are a hit, plus a few Sam and
Stella books (by Marie Louise Gay) which both Delphine and
Cordelia love.  (I love Scholastic.  They do sell some crap, but
their good deals are great.)  We also plough through some 
incredibly advanced dinosaur books; I don't know how much is
sinking in, but she sits and listens for ages.  Incidentally,
I just got a picture book about the latest dinosaur science;
sort of an "everything you thought you knew about dinosaurs
is wrong!" kind of thing.  I am a little conflicted about
reading it to her; on the one hand I know I love to have the
latest information about things.  On the other hand I know it
takes the wind out of my sails to know that all those pictures
of Apatosaurs with their heads up in the air are wrong.  It's
kind of depressing, like what else in this book is wrong?  But
then that's science; if we wanted certainty we would read her
Bible stories.
</p>
<p>
On that note I am going to go sit on the couch and eat sweet potato
pie.  I love pie.  (But not as much as Delphine!  We were having pie
the other day and she said she loves it more than cake.  The Cake or
Pie war continues.  Don't worry, cake, <em>I</em> will never put you second to
pie.) </p>

A couple of months ago Blake and I were just settling into bed
at around 11:00.  Just as we were dropping off to sleep we heard
the familiar <em>Thud.  Creak.  Thud thud thud thud thud</em> of
Delphine getting out of bed and coming down the hall to our room.
She came in and stood silently on Blake's side of the bed.  
Finally he asked, "What do you need, Delphine?"
</p>
<p>
"Choux pastry!"
</p>
<p>
Silence, then, "Would you like me to tuck you back into bed?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes."

Delphine loves to know whether things are real or pretend,
so after a lengthy discussion about ghosts (starting with
"what do ghosts eat?") she changed the subject:
</p>
<p>
"Are dinosaurs real?"
</p>
<p>
"Not any more.  They're all dead."
</p>
<p>
"Why are they all dead?"
</p>
<p>
"Well, that's a good question."  (The lovely thing about
having children is that you can occasionally answer questions
with that <em>without</em> meaning "I don't know.")  I then
took a big breath, about to explain the asteroid theory
(because who doesn't love the idea of a flaming rock flying
at us from space?) when Delphine advanced her own theory.
</p>
<p>
"Maybe they're all dead because people took the bones out
of them to put in museums."
</p>
<p>
Well, I can't say I'd thought of that.

Delphine says "Do you remember when I was three (free) but
not even three and a half and we lived in the old house..."
Or, while we were in the middle of the reno, "...and we 
were not renovating"  Ah, the good old days when we were not
renovating.
</p>
<p>
We finally managed to drag the electric piano upstairs and
the girls love it; Cordelia just bashes away but Delphine
would really like to play properly.  I am going to see if
there are decent piano lessons available for four-year-olds.
In the meantime, though, she calls the high notes "light"
and the low notes "dark"; synaesthesia or just good sense?

<h4>Delphine Watches TV</h4>
<p>
Sometime in the last six months, Delphine has gone from a 
little kid who almost never watches TV to a little kid who
habitually watches one or two shows every day.  It started
after we moved, when the house was littered with choking
hazards, falling hazards, breaking hazards and general
getting in the way hazards and the TV was a handy way
of keeping Delphine happy in one place.  Since then we
just haven't seemed to phase it out, and now I let her
watch a couple of shows when Cordelia is napping.
</p>
<p>
Delphine doesn't like anything with any kind of, how to
put this... conflict.  She is still very easily scared
so we stick with shows where the conflict is mainly 
inter-personal or internal -- Max can't find his monster
mask; Franklin needs help tying knots.    Even still, 
she hides her head in the couch for the scary bits of 
<em>Franklin and the Thunderstorm</em>.
</p>
<p>
So we watch <em>Franklin</em> (love that theme music!),
<em>Max and Ruby</em> (but it's just not the same now that
Samantha Morton isn't voicing Ruby), <em>Timothy Goes To
School</em>, and of course <em>Charlie and Lola</em>, which
I love because it's so very very English and I'm a big ol'
Anglophile.  If you can be a -phile of what you are, anyway.

Delphine just had her fourth birthday!  To celebrate, Blake took
the day off work and we had a nice quiet day together.  We all
went to the bike shop and Delphine got herself a new green
bicycle!  It's very pretty and she rides with verve and confidence,
mainly because they have numerous pedalled vehicles at daycare.
She also got a Playmobil house, which seemed exorbitant but I
hope it will amuse her and Cordelia for years to come.  Playmobil
stuff is so cool.
</p>
<p>
Those were the main presents; in addition to that bounty she got
a puzzle, a Little Red Riding Hood Cape, a bunch of books, some
markers and paints... all kinds of things.  I almost never buy
her any toys apart from at Christmas and birthdays, so she gets
buried under an avalanche of stuff twice a year.
</p>
<p>
Later on Delphine's big day, Ursa and her mom and new baby 
brother came over, along with Baba and Zaida and Morgan and
Erik.  We all had pizza and cake (yellow cake with pink lemonade
icing) and everyone seemed to have a nice time.  I was torn
between having a big party, which I really didn't want to do,
and just having a family dinner which seemed too small and quiet.
I think the extended family plus Ursa gathering that eventually
 happened (after a whole day of planning) was perfect.
</p>
<p>
We have taken Delphine out of daycare.  It was a decision after
its time, since daycare was just a big indulgence what with me
not working and all.  I am a little scared of the prospect of
life without "days off"; I got a lot of mileage out of the 
just-Cordelia days, running errands and doing housework.  But 
plenty of people somehow manage to run their households while
raising all their children, so I am sure I will manage it too.
Delphine will quite enjoy it, I think; for the last few weeks
she has been saying she doesn't want to go to daycare, she just
wants to stay home with me.  Be careful what you wish for, child.
I suspect she will be quite happy to go to Kindergarten in the fall.
</p>
<p>
Delphine and I are reading <em>Ramona the Pest</em>, an actual
novel-type book with chapters and really very few pictures!  It
was recommended in a "Read to your Kids" book I just read, and
I thought I would give it a whirl.  I suspected Delphine would
get sick of it after a page of two without pictures, but she
sits patiently and listens, and wants to carry on to the next
chapter ever night.  I am very excited to read her a book
I remember enjoying myself, a real proper book!

It's not all puppies and roses with Delphine.  She's
testing us all the time lately, on matters both trivial and
not.  This morning we wanted her to be quiet so she
wouldn't wake up Cordelia, and instead she screamed
"I don't want to be quiet!"  Cordelia woke up, I got
really mad at Delphine.  So I pinched her.
</p>
<p>
I don't want to admit that, because some people think
I'm such a great mother, but I have to be honest.
There are people who read this blog who have
crazy kids (like mine), who have trouble handling 
their anger, 
who have made parenting mistakes, and to sit here
and act like Delphine is always good and I am
always cool and perfect
would be a disservice to them and to the whole
concept of talking about parenting.  
</p>
<p>
I wasn't cool — I
was really really angry because it was 5:30 in the
morning and I wanted Cordelia to stay asleep and
Delphine picked that stupid time to see if we
were serious about the "be quiet" thing.
</p>
<p>
I didn't pinch her all that hard, but I wanted to.
This isn't the first time I have wanted to hurt her
because I was angry, but it's the first time I ever
did it.  I hope it's the last.  I have a horrible 
temper and Delphine is trying it more and more
lately.  Hopefully this testing phase will pass
quickly, but of course there will be other
irritating phases in the future.  As is always 
the case on all those parenting shows, the problem
that needs to be fixed is me.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, now Delphine is happily reading books
to her Daddy, none the worse for her experience.
I just hope I can keep the ratio of good 
parenting to appalling mistakes high enough that
she is always resilient enough to bounce back
so easily from my bad behaviour.

One the way home from daycare I stopped off at the LCBO 
to buy beer because it was just that hot.

"Erik likes this," said Delphine as we walked through
the store.  "Erik likes these", she said, as we walked
into the beer section.

"Mummy likes these too, and Auntie Morgan," I said.
</p>
<p>
"No!  Just Erik.  What is this called?"
</p>
<p>
"It's called beer."
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  I don't drink beer.  I'm too little."
</p>
<p>
"That's right."
</p>
<p>
"When I am older I will drink beer.  But not now.
I am still young."
</p>
<p>
It's good to have something to look forward to.

She doesn't say such curious things any more, because
her language skills are better, but she's still pretty
amusing.

Today I went to pick her up from daycare, and asked
if she wanted to wear her sweater home.  She said
"I would rather not wear my sweater."  We don't 
talk down to her or modulate our vocabulary or
grammar, so she comes out with these very

funny if you can hear them coming out of a three-year-old.

On the way home we walked past another mother with a
baby, and Delphine said, loudly and in a scandalized
tone, "The baby has no shoes on!"  Fortunately the other
mother just laughed.

After supper Blake arrived home, having biked.  It's
warm today so he was pretty sweaty.  Delphine said
"You're wet like water, Daddy!  We could swim in
you!"
