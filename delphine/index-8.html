    <p>It’s been a while since Delphine has wanted to play on my little
computer at bedtime.  We’ve been too busy reading old, old books about
animals of various kinds.  Yesterday, we both seemed to realize this,
and decided that tonight we would play on the little computer instead
of reading books.  I’m sure Delphine was thinking something more along
the lines of “We’ll play on the little computer, and <i>then</i> read
books”, but that was never going to happen.</p>

<p>The commentary on this is “It’s a head.  On a slide.  With a hat,
and the sun.”</p>

When I went to pick Delphine up from school this afternoon,
she burst into tears as soon as she saw me.  One of the
other moms pointed her out to me; "Isn't that yours
crying up there?"  The teacher,
a substitute, said "She just started crying, I don't know
what happened!"  
</p>
<p>
I asked Delphine, "Did something happen?"  She shook her
head.  "Did someone do something?"  No.  "Did you lose 
something?"  No.  "Did you hurt yourself?"  No.  "Are
you going to tell me why you're crying?"  No.  So I
didn't press the issue, and we started walking home.  
After we had said goodbye to Delphine's friend and
walked a few more steps, Delphine said "There was
a different teacher, and Mrs Hollister said it was
going to be Mrs Green or Mrs Turk and it wasn't any
of them!  And we had music in the gym, not in music!
Everything was too different!"  And she sobbed.  She
went on to detail further how things were different 
(she had lunch at a friend's house instead of home,
and the gym was all set up for a concert, not like
normal).  She was really upset!  I remember hating 
things to be different when I was a kid, so my heart
went out to her.  Once we got home we read a book and
cuddled on the couch, and she seems to feel better
now.
</p>
<p>
I hope things aren't so different tomorrow!

Delphine is a few months shy of turning five, and she has become
a tremendously capable and independent little thing,  to the point
that I am having trouble figuring out where to set limits.
</p>
<p>
I recently read a wonderful book called <em>Breaking the Good Mom
Myth</em> by Alyson Schafer.  Schafer is an Adlerian psychotherapist,
and the <a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/HStein/guid.htm">Adlerian
philosphy</a> basically says, among other things, that you should throw
as much responsibility on your child as they can handle.  This is
something Blake and I have been doing all along, but the book features
an inspiring list of things that kids should be able to do at each age.
By the time she's eight she'll be running the whole household!
</p>
<p>
Delphine's been dressing herself since she was two, and she can easily
handle the putting on of winter gear that some kids older than her
are still getting helped with.  (I was going to say they couldn't
manage it, but I am sure they could if their parents would just leave
them to it.)  But lately the independence has been getting out of hand.
The other morning I came downstairs to see that Delphine had used a
steak knife to slice a chunk, for breakfast, off an old moldy loaf 
I had forgotten
about.  Yesterday she used my facecloths to clean up after her friend
peed on the bedroom floor.  It's like there's no challenge she can't
face alone!
</p>
<p>
Which is great, but we are going to have to draw some lines and make
some rules.  The first rule has to be about knives, specifically don't
touch them.  The second has to be something about cleaning up messes,
I think.  Cleaning up messes is just very complicated, what with the
different products and tools, not to mention the biohazard factor.  A
grown-up has to be involved.  I am sure we will figure out the limits
we need to set, but in the meantime it's pretty exciting to see her
growing up.

    <p>The main tip-off that these are back-dated entries is my inability
not to use 21:12 as the posting time.</p>

<p>The left-hand image is of a flower beside a river.  The blue at the
top of the picture is the sky.  Only having one shade of blue is one
of the limitations you have to work around when using a free drawing
app on an MP3 player.  Less of a limitation when you’re 4.  The
drawing on the right is a flower, and the sun.  Or maybe it’s a
sunflower.  Heh.</p>

The other day I went with Delphine's class on a field trip
to the Toronto Botanical Gardens.  I was put in charge of
Delphine; Annie, with long blonde hair in a messy ponytail and
huge blue Cindy Loo Who eyes; and Alyssa, tiny and cheerful
and not particularly inclined to stay with the group.
</p>
<p>
After all the festivities of looking at leaves and planting
garlic cloves and holding compost worms, we all stopped for
a snack.  The children got granola bars, but I had packed myself
an apple because I knew I would be hungry too.  (I eat like a 
little kid, lots of snacks.)  Alyssa asked what kind of apple
it was.
</p>
<p>
"It’s a Honeycrisp.  I haven't tried them before but I really
like it; it's crispy and juicy and sweet.  We usually get Royal Gala."
</p>
<p>
"We get Honeycrisp," said Alyssa.  "I like them."
</p>
<p>
"We get Golden Russet," said Annie.  I asked if she liked
them and she said she did.  "They're brown and the skin is
kind of rough."
</p>
<p>
I said I would try them next time I bought apples, but
they didn't have any at the grocery store yesterday.
</p>
<p>
Isn't that a weird conversation to have with four and five
year-olds?  I guess that's when you get when you live in
a neighbourhood of foodies.
