<p>Delphine's birthday was better than her party, although
still a weird day. For one thing, it's Mother's Day so
she had to share her special day with me.  And after
breakfast, Cordelia came down with that same miserable
puking sickness Delphine just recovered from. But before
the major puking set in, Delphine managed to open a truly
impressive haul of presents. I love buying things for her, and
I don't indulge throughout the year, so birthdays and 
Christmas are OTT.</p>
<p>She got a million books, some science magazines, a prism
to hang in her window, some hairbands, a bunch of super cute
summer clothes from Baba, games from friends, wind chimes,
a badminton set, some stationery, and her very own metal
water bottle to take to school. I managed to get her a
whole bunch of stuff without adding to the existing quantities
of junk in her room: no new dolls, no new buddies, no new
Playmobil or little toys which are hard to put away. More
books, but she still has plenty of feet of empty bookshelf
space to fill before that becomes a problem.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was pretty low key. Blake and I
spelled off lying on the couch with Cordelia and hanging
out with Delphine; he played badminton, I helped her
paint her wind chime. Later Baba and Zaida took her out
for a swim, while Blake and I took turns napping with
Cordelia. I took the first shift, and woke up in one 
of those completely confused hazes. A cup of tea cured
that, and I commenced making Delphine's birthday cake.
I did a crazy food colouring rainbow cake; three layers
of cake (purple, green and orange) separated by three
layers of icing (blue, yellow and red). Considering I
started it so late in the day and I've never made a
cake like that it turned out pretty well. (Pictures were
taken and will eventually appear.)</p>
<p>Delphine didn't eat much of her birthday dinner; her
appetite still hasn't recovered since she was sick.
But she had a nice time with her family and she liked
her presents (hooray!). This might not have been the
best birthday ever, but it was still a good one.</p>

<p>Today was Delphine's last day of being five, and also the day
of her birthday party. There almost was no party; Delphine has
been laid low with some kind of puking and fatigue disease.
She stayed home from school on Friday and I warned the
party invitees that the party may be off. This morning
Delphine woke up feeling better, so I made a bunch of calls to
summon the troops.  One of the kids had already changed her 
plans, so in fact
of Delphine's original list of six, only three children
were able to come. (Two of her list had previously declined.)</p>
<p>The weather wasn't conducive to small-child-partying. There
were intermittent thunderstorms all day, which meant all our
fun outside games were transferred inside, smaller and darker
and less fun. </p>
<p>I don't know if the children enjoyed themselves; they 
certainly aren't shy about letting you know when they're
not having fun, when they don't like a game, when they 
don't like any of the food, when someone isn't playing the
way they want you to, or indeed when anything isn't rocking
their little worlds. But nobody screamed and demanded to be
sent home, so I suppose that's a win. You might guess
I didn't particularly enjoy hosting today's party.</p>
<p>Delphine didn't have a great day either. It started
with still being a little bit sick, complicated by bad
weather, missing friends, and a party that didn't go as
smoothly as she wanted it to - Cordelia didn't play 
the games properly and nobody listened to her. By this 
afternoon she didn't
like any of her presents and nobody loved her, and by 7:15 pm
she was begging to go to bed. Tomorrow is her birthday
and I hope it goes better.</p>
<p>(It's now 9:47 pm, and Delphine is crying in her room. Blake
went upstairs to comfort her, and I just heard her say, 
"I want chicken!" Turns out she wanted Chicken her buddy,
not chicken the food.)</p>

<p>Delphine and I were walking to a playdate a few weeks
ago.  As we walked she asked me about the names of the
streets we were on, and which way they all go.  I
said, maybe sometime we can make a map of the neighbourhood.
"Maybe," I said, "you could do it at your playdate, and
your friend's mother could help."</p>
<p>"That would be fun." said Delphine, "But my friend will
only want to play fairies!"</p>
<p>Then she paused and said, "No-one ever wants to do what
I want to do."  (She is prone to these gloomy 
generalizations.)  "None of my friends like what
I like."</p>
<p>I explained to her that she has only met thirty people her
age at school, plus a handful more at daycare and around.
I said as she goes through school she'll meet more people and
maybe one day she we meet someone who wants to make maps
instead of playing with fairies.  Sooner or later we
all find our people.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday was Delphine's last day of summer vacation.
We stuck labels on her <a href="http://www.landsend.com/pp/SolidClassMateJuniorBackpack~146384_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::PRO&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_00004__0000000491">new backpack</a>, 
lunch bag and 
<a href="http://zeta.zappos.com/product/7319163/color/16179">shoes</a>, and speculated about her new teacher, which
of last year's kids would be in this year's class, and 
whether the JKs would be cute or not.  While we were
eating lunch I wondered how we had felt on the same day last
year, Delphine's last day before Junior Kindergarten. 
Were we excited, were we nervous?  I don't know, and I
never will because I never wrote it down.  </p>
<p>This year Delphine was a little nervous.  She was 
scared that the teacher wouldn't like her, although
that fear was largely soothed by the arrival of a 
lovely letter from Mrs Thompson to Delphine (in the
mail, no less!)  saying how excited she was to 
meet Delphine and what fun they would have in 
kindergarten, learning letters and numbers.  Delphine
was a bit offended by that last bit — "I already
know letters and numbers!" — but I said Mrs T
probably sent the same letter to the SKs and JKs, 
who might not know their letters and numbers yet.</p>
<p>I, too, was a little nervous, probably more so than
last year because this year I know what is coming —
a lot of getting people places on time and not much
time in between to take stock.  But only a little
nervous, because this year I do know what's coming,
and I have a plan, and perhaps most importantly I
have accepted that taking people places is my main
job during the school year (well, along with feeding
and clothing them), and anything else I can
get done apart from that is pretty much bonus.  So
rather than regarding the commuting as an inconvenient
interruption to my life, I now just go along with it.
Think of all the exercise!</p>
<p>Delphine's first day of school was last Wednesday.
She's still in afternoons, and she's in the same classroom
as last year, and as it turns out, all the Seniors were
in her class last year.  The first day of school
was only Seniors, so she got to renew some old friendships
and get to know her new teacher.  Delphine loves Mrs Thompson!
Mrs Thompson smiles a lot, and on the first day she wore a pink
dress — I don't know if that was calculated to win the
favour of a roomful of five-year-old girls (the Seniors
are six girls and two boys) but if it was, it worked.
Delphine says Mrs Thompson does everything in the
wrong order (which is to say, not the way Mrs
Hollister did it) but she seems willing to indulge her
errors.    Mrs Thompson taught her a new song!
In fact, yesterday Mrs Thompson taught her the 
Macarena!  And they say public schooling is inferior!</p>
<p>Delphine has now had four days of SK.  She wasn't
impressed by the JKs on day two — they were noisy
and talked too much — but yesterday she kind of made
friends with one of them.  She had gym on Thursday 
(her teacher's name is Mr Laundry!  Actually it's
Mr Landry, but 'Mr Laundry' cracks her up) and Library
on Friday, and everything seems to be going fabulously.</p>
<p>Since Delphine learned to read over the summer, and
SK/Grade 1 is supposed to be when you learn to read,
I'm going to talk to Mrs Thompson about what, if any,
other goals Delphine should work towards over the 
school year, and what kinds of enrichment she can
offer her.  She's beyond the basic "k-k-k-kite"
Jolly Phonics stuff this year, so I hope we can manage
not to bore her out of her tree.  Especially 
considering there are only eight SKs.  But I'm
borrowing trouble, I'm sure we'll work something out.
Now it's time to make lunch and haul everyone off to
school, at least once I manage to get some clothes
on Cordelia.</p>

<p>This afternoon, Cordelia wanted to “paint on your computer”!  so after
I finished my game, I fired up Sketches, and this is what she ended up
painting.  It’s nothing in particular, but kind of pretty nonetheless.</p>

Delphine and Cordelia have really started fighting in
earnest, sibling-style, lately.  Previously they got in
little tiffs about who should play with which toy, or
who should be on what side of the bath — sensible
stuff — but now they just bicker for the sake of it.
The other day I heard this:
</p>

<p>
Delphine: "You're a pest!  You're Ramona!"<br>
Cordelia: "No I not Ramona!  I not in a book!"<br>
Delphine: "Yes you are!"<br>
Cordelia: "This in't a book!"
</p>

<p>
But later that same day Delphine retreated to her
room for half an hour and emerged with four pages
stapled together with a drawing of a princess to
colour in, some dotted lines to trace over and
letters to copy.  It was an activity book for
Cordelia, and on the first page she titled it
"UORVAREFRSTBOKK".  ("Your Very First Book")  She
spent all that time and thought to do something 
nice for her sister.  That's how I know she really
loves her, even though she is a pest.
</p>

<p>
Delphine's writing is progressing (although as
you can see she doesn't know about spaces 
between words, internal vowels are sporadic, and
she prefers ALL CAPS) and she loves 
to write things down.  The trend now is to let 
little kids just write things down anyhow and 
work on spelling later; it's called inventive
spelling and for me it mainly reinforces how
difficult and random the English language is.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday Delphine decided she wanted to write
down some girl names that she liked, in case she
has a girl baby.  Here is what she came up with:
</p>

<p>
<u>GORLS</u> (That's the title.)<br>
GABREELA (Gabriella)<br>
MEGI<del>M</del>N (Megan)<br>

<p>I’ve recently installed a new version of Sketches, and today Delphine
asked if we could draw another picture.  So we did.  Then we emailed
it to Amy, and I got Delphine to tell me what letters to write for her
sentence.  (I also told her about putting a space between each word,
which is something that Ms. Hollister said that we could tell her
about if we wanted.)</p>
<p>The sentence was “Ths is a heis on a hil wth to bsis.”, which I’m sure

Delphine turned five this Saturday, and we had a party 
on the deck.
Delphine invited five of her friends, and between food
and cleaning up and decorating and games and loot it
was almost as much work as a grown-up party.  But
now the house is clean!  Ish.
</p>
<p>
The night before her birthday, Delphine slept over at
Baba and Zaida's house.  Baba wanted to take Delphine
to <a href="http://www.sciencerendezvous.ca/">Science
Rendezvous</a> in the morning, and I had a book club 
meeting Friday night, so a sleepover was advantageous
for all.  
</p>
<p>
Saturday dawned bright but not as early as usual; 
we had put Cordelia down early on Friday so between
that and not having Delphine around to wake her, 
she slept in until 7:45.  (Did you know if you put
your kids to bed earlier they sleep later?  Weird
but true.)  We got up and leapt into action; Blake
and Cordelia picked up flowers and bread and pickles, I cleaned
up and made egg salad and iced cupcakes and put up
the daisy decorations Delphine had made.  After 
lunch we put Cordelia down for an early nap, and 
Auntie Morgan came over to help out.
</p>
<p>
The party started at 2:00, and Delphine only got
home a few minutes before that in time to put on her new
red party dress.  All the partiers arrived on time
—Ursa, Erika, Tina, Sydney, and Athena, and four
out of the five Mums stayed, which was cool; also
in attendance were Baba and Zaida and Auntie Morgan
and Uncle Erik —
and we got into the swing of things: crafts, a treasure
hunt (the treasure was wrapped boxes of Nerds),
some dancing games (they didn't seem to enjoy those
much), Pass the Parcel (that was a huge hit), and
of course little sandwiches, chips, cake, ice cream
and jelly (Jell-o, except made with real juice).
(That was a really long sentence with altogether
too much punctuation.)
There was a good bit of random running around the 
backyard, too, which was more popular than I 
expected.
</p>
<p>
Delphine mostly had a good time — she got mad
at me when I didn't take her suggestion for a
music game (who knew "Row Row Row Your Boat" was
even a game?) but otherwise it was nice.  There is
some weird bullying/power abuse going on with
one of the girls and we tried to ameliorate that
as much as we could, but Delphine wasn't directly
involved so it didn't seem to bother her.  We'll
have the "victim" over for a playdate sometime to
make her feel more welcome and loved.  (She — the
victim — is
a very intensely affectionate little girl, and 
that annoys the others a bit, and so they are
mean to her – they say she can't play with
them.  Not surprisingly she's also
intensely emotional so she takes it seriously
when someone says something hurtful.  It's a 
mess; I'm so glad I'm not a little girl any
more!  That sucked!)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, apart from that the party was a hit, and
Delphine got some great presents and had a lovely
day.   
</p>
<p>
In addition
to turning five, she has also grown two centimeters
in the last month, and she can now read upside-down.
Well, she can't properly read books and stuff, but
she's getting pretty good at picking out individual
words as long as their spelling is "standard".  I
guess the memorization of non-standard words really
begins once you start reading in earnest and encounter
those words more.  (Although of course she can read
"one" and "two" which are non-standard, so I guess 
she has already started to build up that database.)
She's working on learning to ride a bike without
training wheels, and to skip.  Five is going to
be a very exciting year!

I gave Delphine and Cordelia each a lollipop after 
lunch today, and wow, was it ever quiet with two 
gobs stopped up with candy!  When Delphine was
halfway through hers, she said, "If I were going
to name this thing I'm eating, I would call it
Lick Sticks.  Because you lick it, and it's a stick.
It doesn't pop, and you don't lolly it!"

<p>
She has a future in marketing.

Delphine is just under two months away from being five, and
in the last month or so she went through one of those quantum changes —
your kid goes to bed one day and she's four and a half, and
wakes up the next day and she's nearly five.  Her hair is
longer, her face is more girlish and less babyish, she has
all these freckles that came out of nowhere, she uses long
words and elaborate grammatical constructions, she can almost
read.  It's a bit dizzying, frankly, but I couldn't be happier.
The more she moves away from babyhood the more I like hanging
out with her.
</p>
<p>
So yeah, she can almost read.  I would say she's a few weeks
from really being able to read; she can sound out short
(phonically logical) words, and she is learning a few tricks
(like looking at the first letter and the associated picture
and guessing!) to work out the other 95% of the English
language.  She's also sight-learned a few words, which suits
me because that's largely how I (and I assume most literate
adults) read.
</p>
<p>
I will say now that I hate phonics.  I hated it when I was a
kid and I still hate it now.  I hated it when I was a kid because
it didn't work (and because I thought it was a lame crutch for
kids who couldn't "really" read — I was a huge snob when I was
a kid).  I hate it now because it still doesn't work; I feel like
such a fraud when I tell Delphine to "sound it out" when I know
that that's a technique which will hardly ever help her figure 
out a word.  I am 
perplexed by the
emphasis phonics receives, unless it's because no-one has come up
with a better way of "teaching" kids to read, and they want
to feel like they're doing something.  The English language is
too full of exceptions for phonics to be worth anything —
if you want to read anything more interesting than the most
pedestrian Easy Reader (another thing I hated as a kid) you
are going to come across the word "one" or the word "weigh"
or the word "said" and phonics is going to let you down.  I 
don't have any answers, though.  All I know is I figured out
how to read by being read to (no-one taught me) and I expect
my children will do that same, whether or not they 
learn "k-k-k-kite" at school.
</p>
<p>
Back to Delphine, who can also write.  She can form letters
like a demon, so she writes quickly if you spell things out for
her, but she's also really bold about writing on her own and
guessing how things are spelled.  She loves to write cards for
her friends.  "Athena I love you."  They are always love letters.
</p>
<p>
Okay, this is my last brag about Delphine, I promise.  We were
talking about aunties the other day; since she's been old enough
to talk we've been working with the convenient fiction that she
has two aunties, Auntie Morgan and Auntie J'Anne.  On Sunday I
decided she's old enough to understand that Auntie J'Anne is actually
Daddy's auntie and her Great-Aunt (although J'Anne is hardly the
quivering  old dear that the title implies).  To illustrate
the idea  I decided
to do a family tree.  I walked Delphine through drawing up a 
crude diagram with circles for each person and lines joining us all
up.  When it came to labelling, Delphine decided that she was going
to write each person's name around their circle, with the letters
projecting out perpendicular to the surface of the circle.  (I'll 
take a picture so you can see what I mean.)  And she did so, forming
each letter correctly with respect to the slope of the circle, without 
turning the paper around.  That means she can <em>rotate two-dimensional
objects in her head</em>!
</p>
<p>
Obviously I think that's pretty cool, whether or not almost-five is
exactly when you would expect someone to be able to rotate 
two-dimensional objects in their head (I have no idea).   It's
math!  Do you know what this means?  It means she'll be able to
read maps, and walk around strange cities without getting hopelessly
lost, and figure out where this bit goes on that bicycle without 
trying it!  It means she'll be able to do those useless spatial
manipulation questions in IQ tests!  I suppose I shouldn't be 
surprised that she has math
brain — she comes from two families of math heads — but I'm still
pleased.  Now we just need to get her doing cryptics.
</p>
<p>
Part of the being-almost-five (and not really four anymore) is that
Delphine is generally nicer to be around (don't let anyone tell you
about Terrible Twos, Four is much worse.  Twos get a bad rap.)  However
I can't get her to stop yelling at Cordelia.  Poor Cordelia seems
to get screamed at all day, when she won't give up a toy, when
she can't learn the rules of a game, when she hides wrong in 
Hide and Seek.  I know Delphine learned all about yelling from me,
but the scale is entirely different!  I have yelled at her fewer
than ten times in her whole life, whereas she seems to yell at
DeeDee ten times a day.  Well, maybe five.  I guess they mean
it when they say your bad behaviour will be reflected in your
kids' behaviour, but I didn't realize it would be magnified to 
this extent.  
I have a book out about managing Anger and Aggression (for parents
and children) so hopefully that will help.  Because I don't
have Clue One what to do at this point.  At least March Break is
over so they can get out of each other's hair for a while every
day.
