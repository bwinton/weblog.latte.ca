<p>Delphine loves to read. We've recently been reading time travel books:
we read <em>The Root Cellar</em> by Janet Lunn, and now we're reading 
<em>A Handful of Time</em> by Kit Pearson. She also loves mysteries
(like her mother, her aunt, her great-aunt, her grandmother, her
other grandmother...) and is working on a Trixie Belden novel by
herself.</p>
<p>Delphine also loves to watch TV. She loves <em>WordGirl</em> but she
loves <em>Kim Possible</em> more, which I'm kind of bummed about. Blake
introduced her to <em>Kim Possible</em> because she liked <em>WordGirl</em>
and y'know, female superhero. But <em>Kim Possible</em> is a teenage
character, and well into that "kids are cool and parents are lame"
stage, and I wish Delphine wasn't being exposed to that already.
Unfortunately the horse is out of the barn now; failing another
hard disk crash (hmmmm) we're going to be watching <em>Kim Possible</em>
until Delphine goes onto another thing or I ban TV altogether.</p>
<p>Delphine is no great fan of hard work. At school she goes to great pains
to make sure she's not at the beginning of the line, so she doesn't have
to hold the door. She loves the idea of having lots of responsibilities,
but she hates the reality of dropping whatever fun activity she's
doing in order to do the job.</p>
<p>She has a few jobs lately: she cleans the cat litter every other time
(I alternate with her); she helps clear the table; she's in charge of
her own morning routine and I'm trying to get her to help Cordelia,
too; she is in charge of her own bedroom, including putting away
laundry (which in effect means her room is a mess and her laundry
stays on her desk). The doing of all these jobs is prefaced by a 
great deal of moaning and whining. I feel somehow responsible for that
because I hated housework and it took me years to understand that
if I wanted my house to be nice I had to do the work of making it so.
I also have trouble understanding that things that are worth doing
take effort and time, and aren't always fun. I would like Delphine to
learn that before she's, like, twenty-five. Maybe then she won't be
a big old quitter like I was.</p>
<p>Delphine is in gymnastics, trampoline and swimming this term. I
didn't mean for her to be an overscheduled child, but I happened to
check the city swimming classes and there were classes available at
the right time and the right level, which never happens, so I had
to pounce. She likes the classes in this order: swimming first, 
then trampoline, then gymnastics. This is interesting because swimming
is, like, $90, trampoline is $35 and gymnastics is $225.</p>
<p>Swimming is going very well: she does front crawl and jumps in and
puts her head under water, all of which she couldn't do at the
beginning of the session. With gymnastics she's hit a bit of a 
roadblock because she doesn't like to be upside down. More than
that, she absolutely refuses to be upside down. This rules out
such cornerstones of gymnastics as somersaults, cartwheels, and
anything interesting on the bars. So either she has to bust through
that or I don't think she'll be having any more $200 gymnastics classes.</p>
<p>I think school is going well. It's hard to tell, on account of she's
always in a bad mood on the way home, so she regales me with complaints
about how boring it is and how she hates everyone. Later in the day,
when she's rested and fed, I hear about the interesting things she
did and the fun she had. I suppose both angles could be true.</p>
<p>She seems much older lately; she's moody and critical and opinionated
and complicated. And she's clever and insightful and interesting
and passionate. She's, I think, like me: she's going to have to
grow into her personality. It definitely isn't a little girl's
personality. She's a tiny grown-up.</p>
