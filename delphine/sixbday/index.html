<p>Delphine's birthday was better than her party, although
still a weird day. For one thing, it's Mother's Day so
she had to share her special day with me.  And after
breakfast, Cordelia came down with that same miserable
puking sickness Delphine just recovered from. But before
the major puking set in, Delphine managed to open a truly
impressive haul of presents. I love buying things for her, and
I don't indulge throughout the year, so birthdays and 
Christmas are OTT.</p>
<p>She got a million books, some science magazines, a prism
to hang in her window, some hairbands, a bunch of super cute
summer clothes from Baba, games from friends, wind chimes,
a badminton set, some stationery, and her very own metal
water bottle to take to school. I managed to get her a
whole bunch of stuff without adding to the existing quantities
of junk in her room: no new dolls, no new buddies, no new
Playmobil or little toys which are hard to put away. More
books, but she still has plenty of feet of empty bookshelf
space to fill before that becomes a problem.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was pretty low key. Blake and I
spelled off lying on the couch with Cordelia and hanging
out with Delphine; he played badminton, I helped her
paint her wind chime. Later Baba and Zaida took her out
for a swim, while Blake and I took turns napping with
Cordelia. I took the first shift, and woke up in one 
of those completely confused hazes. A cup of tea cured
that, and I commenced making Delphine's birthday cake.
I did a crazy food colouring rainbow cake; three layers
of cake (purple, green and orange) separated by three
layers of icing (blue, yellow and red). Considering I
started it so late in the day and I've never made a
cake like that it turned out pretty well. (Pictures were
taken and will eventually appear.)</p>
<p>Delphine didn't eat much of her birthday dinner; her
appetite still hasn't recovered since she was sick.
But she had a nice time with her family and she liked
her presents (hooray!). This might not have been the
best birthday ever, but it was still a good one.</p>
