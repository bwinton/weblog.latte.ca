    <p>As you may remember, I <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake/random/biking/Ouch.html">fell off
my bike</a> a few weeks ago.  Well, ever since then, my shoulder has
been hurting if I tried to raise it horizontally with my palm up.
This morning, I went to my wife's chiropracter to see if she could
tell me why, and what was up with it.  After moving my arm in a bunch
of ways, she determined that I did something with my rotator cuff, and
so I'm going to see her again on Thursday, and she gave me a strange
exercise to do in the meantime.  I'm not exactly sure how the <a href="http://patients.uptodate.com/topic.asp?file=bone_joi/8115">pendulum
stretching exercise</a> will help, but that's the second reference
I've found to it, so I guess it does something.  (She suggested I do
it without the weight, though.  Actually, she didn't mention a weight
at all, but I think my arm is probably heavy enough to have some
benefit as it is.)  Similarly, the muscles on the knee that I came
down on are far tighter than the ones on the other side, so I suspect
we'll be working on that as well in the coming visits.</p>

<p>I'll have to remember to ask her on Thursday how long she thinks it
will take to heal up.  Here's hoping it gets better sooner (like the
"2-4 weeks minimum" listed on the previous webpage), instead of later
(like the "never" listed on the previous webpage).</p>

Today is my thirtieth birthday.  So far it has been pleasant; Delphine
let us sleep in until 6:40 (forty minutes extra), and we've been 
pootling around the house ever since.  I did some chores, Blake 
played with Delphine, we all had showers, I had cake and ice cream
and read the newspaper.  Delphine is napping right now, and after she's
up I will open my presents.  She seems more excited about them than
I am.  Presents aren't really as much fun as they used to be when I
was a little kid.  This year will be different than usual, though, because
I got presents from friends as well as family and I have no idea what
they might be.
</p>
<p>
I'm happy to finally be in my thirties.  My life is more that of 
someone in their thirties than someone in their twenties; I have
kids, I have a mortgage, I cook and clean and own furniture made
out of actual wood, I don't drink or go out clubbing, I spend my
money on diapers and organic fruit, not shoes and manicures.  I
am more Heather Mallick than Leah McLaren.  It's good to finally be
in a decade that suits me.  (But I still think I've always been 
forty on the inside, and I think that will be a very good decade for me.)
</p>
<p>
We had a party yesterday; since this is likely our last summer in the
condo I thought we should have a barbeque up on the roof, and my 
birthday was the perfect excuse.  It was a fantastic party; very
low-budget and low-effort, with paper plates and burgers and hot
dogs and a cake from Loblaws and ice cream in cones for the toddlers.
And balloons!  I think it was just perfect.  
</p>
<p>
Jeff, Janet, Kathryn, Douglas and Tanya
and Ursa, Ellen and Peter and Dexter and Maxine, Baba and Zaida,
and Morgan and Erik all came and we just sat and talked and watched
the little ones play.  Morgan and Erik were in charge of the meat
and they did a fine job.  They also lent us their Cadillac of coolers
which happily held dozens of bottles of beer and pop, and then 
ice cream and leftover meat later on.  It's living in our hallway now.
I wonder if they want it back?
</p>
<p>
Almost everyone got to hold Maxine -- she is around six weeks old
now.  Delphine was especially taken with her; when I got my turn to 
hold Maxine, Delphine came and sat next to me and touched her: 
"There's baby's foot.  There's baby's ankle.  There's baby's other
ankle.  There's baby's knee.  Baby's crying."  Yeah, she cried for
me; she didn't cry for anyone else.  Possibly because I was the 
only one who let a toddler fondle her legs.  Anyway, Delphine did
not seem upset or perturbed by Maxine at all this time, just very 
interested.
I am quite looking forward to seeing how she is with our baby.
I expect she will be pretty happy with it until she figures out
that it's staying.
</p>
<p>
Another friend of mine just had a baby (nine days early!  Whoo!).
She lives just a block or two from here so I hope Delphine and I
can go over and visit a time or two before our baby comes.
</p>
<p>
Delphine and I both got sunburned yesterday.  I swore I wouldn't let
her get sunburned under my watch, and already I have failed.  She's,
what, just two years and three months old?  That's pretty lousy.  I even
brought the sunblock upstairs but then I was too stupid to put it
on either me or Delphine.  I think I figured it's late enough in the
summer that we have enough tan to protect us from sunburn.  Except
Delphine hasn't any tan at all because I've been so careful up until
now, and I was wearing a different style of shirt than usual so I 
had fresh virgin skin exposed to the afternoon sun.  Fortunately 
Delphine's burn has already faded to very faint pinkness, and mine 
doesn't look bad enough to blister.  Still, though.  Stupid.
</p>
<p>
Delphine's sleeping, incidentally, has gone from awful to sublime.
The very day after I posted about the problems and my intended plan of
action, she went to bed (about twenty minutes earlier than usual) 
with barely a whimper, and slept longer in the morning.  Last night
was even better; at around 6:30 she announced to Kathryn that she
was tired and wanted to go to bed, so Blake put her down and she did
not cry, not one bit.  Then, like I said above, she slept an extra
forty minutes this morning.  And furthermore, at 11:00 this morning
she told Blake she wanted to lie down for a nap, and she was down and
sleeping by 11:06.  It's not 12:53, so she will probably be up soon.
</p>
<p>
But man, that Weissbluth is a genius.  You only have to <em>read
his book</em> for your kid to sleep better.  I need to buy a copy of
it for myself. Since it covers sleep problems right up to adolescence,
I'm sure I will need it again.
</p>
<p>
The new baby is doing great.  For the last few days he's -- I just
realized I'm using "he" far too often; I think I am getting really 
stuck on the idea of it being a boy because everyone I know who has
had their second baby this summer has had one of the other gender than
their first, and also because all the superstitious types are saying
it's a boy because of how I'm carrying, and also because I would really
kind of like it to be a boy -- so for the last few days <em>she's</em>
been kicking and moving around a lot, which is very cool if occasionally
uncomfortable.  I have another midwife appointment tomorrow, and I hope
they will be more certain about her position.  Two appointments ago
my primary midwife said she was head up, but at the last appointment my
secondary said she was head down.  I don't think it matters at this
point, but we are rapidly approaching the point where it does.

Delphine is twenty six months old (or thereabouts) and all seems to be
well.  She talks in full sentences, and occasionally  they are gramatically
perfect, which is a bit of a thrill.  
</p>
<p>
She's still in daycare, three days a week.  She is quite stuck on
one of the other kids there, a little boy named Antonio.  She has
taught herself to jump two-footed, and when she does it she  says
"Are you jumping like Antonio?"  (She communicates a lot in rhetorical 
questions.)  And whenever we talk about daycare, Antonio's name
is always the first to come up.  "Who did you see at daycare?"
"Antonio."  "Who is going to be at daycare today?  "Antonio."
Antonio is a very boisterous and energetic little boy, kind of 
the alpha male of daycare, and I don't know if he holds her in 
the same regard, but I don't think she really cares.
</p>
<p>
Her latest literary love is Franklin the Turtle.  My dad sent her a 
couple of Franklin books for her birthday.  I was a little skeptical
at first because they are pretty wordy - several paragraphs - and they 
are just prose, not rhyme.  But she sits through them and asks for them
again and again.  We also go back to the usual favourites all the
time; "One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish",  "Each Peach Pear Plum", 
and lots of nursery rhymes.
</p>
<p>
We haven't really started potty training in earnest.  I'm hoping it
will just happen all by itself.  We have a potty, and sometimes she
sits on it, but never for long enough for a result.  They also
encourage her to sit on the toilet at daycare (they have the cutest
little toddler sized toilets), so I'm hoping one day soon something
will happen.  Antonio is close to being potty trained; maybe that
will help.
</p>
<p>
We're having trouble with sleep; for the last week (or two?) she
has been resisting going to bed, and crying for ages before finally
sleeping.  We have been going in to see her intermittently. She always
has a raft of byzantine demands; a different blanket, Boy (her doll)
in the crib, Boy out of the crib, a kleenex, and so on.  Clearly she
is just stalling, and it was working really well for her; lots
of attention and extra time with Mummy and Daddy..  
</p>
<p>
But I got
Weissbluth's "Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child" out of the library
again and having re-read the first few chapters, I think that she is
probably sleep-deprived because we moved her bedtime later a few weeks
ago. (In addition to the trouble sleeping, she has also been acting
very two-ish in the afternoons and evenings -- very contrary and 
tantrumy and generally not like herself at all.)
</p>
<p>
So we are going to move her bedtime back up to 6:30 or 6:00
(even though I have no idea how we're going to make it work with our
schedules) and starting tomorrow we will let her cry herself to sleep
instead of going in every few minutes.  It's mean but it works.
I was going to start today, but Blake thought it would be nicer to
go in one last time and explain to her that he wasn't going to come back,
and she should just go to sleep.  Sure enough, she didn't cry after that,
so maybe the same thing will work tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
So, in general, she is getting smarter, and I think prettier, and 
definitely taller. I think my very favourite thing is when Blake brings
her into the bedroom first thing in the morning, and she says
"Hi Mummy!" and we cuddle and read books.

    <p>On my ride home yesterday, it started to rain.  I haven't ridden in
the rain much, so I figured I'ld do a test stop, to see how much
longer it would take me to come to a complete halt.  I waited until I
was on an empty street, fairly close to my home, and peddled until I
got to 32km/h (I usually get to 35km/h on that stretch of street, <a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/weblog/Hurt%20And%20Baba/large/Knee.jpg"><img align="right" src="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/weblog/Hurt%20And%20Baba/Knee.jpg"></a>
but I didn't want to push it).  It turns out that at that speed, it
takes me approximately twice as long, which is good to know.<a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/weblog/Hurt%20And%20Baba/large/Elbow.jpg"><img align="left" src="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/weblog/Hurt%20And%20Baba/Elbow.jpg"></a>
I figured I would take it a little slower for the rest of the ride
home.  I made a left, then a right, and then, as I was slowing down
nice and gently, and making the next right, my front wheel hit a patch
of water, and locked up.  The bike turned, and I completely bailed
onto the street, landing on my knee, and then my elbow.  It was kind
of fun sliding down the pavement on a layer of water.  Sort of like a
Slip-N-Slide.  I picked myself up, used the rest of the water in my
bottle to rinse off the worst of the gravel, and biked home, where Amy
scrubbed the injuries with a washcloth, and put some Polysporin on
them to heal.  They're already looking a lot better, and they don't
hurt much, so I'm hoping for a swift recovery, with minimal scarring.

<em>thirty-nine</em> -- I was complaining, for the first time, about
leg pain pelvic twinges and having to walk slower.  Until then I had
been just fine.  It was like a
pretend pregnancy; pregnancy-lite.
</p>
<p>
I have been dealing with that stuff for weeks <em>already</em> this 
time!  If I have been sitting for a long time and then I stand up,
I get this miserable ache in my pelvis, like you get the first time
you go for a long bike ride in spring, except <em>on the inside</em>.  
I can't
walk at faster than an amble without getting these crazy stitches
in my sides.  I can't walk at <em>any</em> pace for more than about
twenty-minutes without taking a bread.
I have to lie at funny angles, or propped up with a
pillow, or else the weight of my belly pulls at my sides in weird ways.
And I had a leg cramp last night that was so bad that I woke Blake
up with my freaking out.
</p>
<p>
And so tired.  I can sleep and sleep and sleep, and when I wake up, 
all I want to do is sleep some more.  I wish I could have a
day off to just gorge myself on sleep.
</p>
<p>
So needless to say, I will reiterate <em>two more months</em>?!
I can't imagine whether and how it will get worse.  I have to 
improve my attitude, though, I am spending far too much time feeling
sorry for myself.  It's hard not to, though, between the pregnancy 
and this absurdly hot weather and the bad back thing.  Poor 'ittle 
me.
</p>
<p>
It's making me realize why the birth rate plummets as soon as a society
starts to educate and emancipate their women.  "You mean I don't 
<em>have</em> to do this?  Hell no!"

I can't believe I still have more than two months left.  <em>Two
months</em>.  I am so done.  I am huge and ungainly; my pelvis
hurts half of the time, and I can't walk at faster than an amble
without getting miserable cramps.  Oh, and the varicose veins.
I could have done without them.
</p>
<p>
In better news, I don't have gestational diabetes, my hemoglobin 
is great, and I'm generally healthy.  I'm now visiting the midwife
every two weeks instead of every month, which certainly makes me
feel like something is starting to happen.  
</p>
<p>
I had a real moody day yesterday; I felt very anxious and ready
to cry at any moment.  There was no real reason for it, though, and
sure enough I felt better this morning.  It didn't hurt that I got
lots of sleep, and it was sunny and beautiful when I woke up.  And
Sunday!  I love the weekend.  I think I will always love weekends.

<p>
There is almost nothing to do before this baby comes, unlike last
time when there was everything to do.  I would like to get a new
dresser from Ikea, one that is the right height to be a changing
table.  (My back is not going to forgive me for another three years
of changing diapers hunched over our bed.)  And we need to pack the
bag for the hospital, but that can wait.  Oh, and we need another
car seat.
</p>
<p>
Apart from that, well, if he's a boy I will probably
have to get some boyish clothes, but since we need to get him or
her winter clothes anyway (since Delphine's baby stuff is all 
summery) we can just layer the boy sweaters over the effeminate
underthings.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and I bet we will need a tandem stroller, but I am having
no luck finding a tandem version of the cheap umbrella strollers.
Do they even exist?  I don't want to spend upwards of two hundred
bucks on another stroller, but I thought it would be handy to have
a tandem.
</p>

Yesterday we all went up to the suburbs to visit Ellen and Dexter
and their new baby Maxine, who is just a month old.  She is very small --
still two pounds smaller than Delphine was when she was born.  Blake
was a little weirded out by her smallness; he thinks she's too small
to be out.  I, on the other hand, can't imagine something that big
still being in.  It's the paradox of birthing a huge human head
through tiny human hips.
</p>
<p>
Delphine was pretty stuck by the baby.  After we got home, she was
very emotional, so I asked her if she was sad -- "yeah".  Was she
sad about Maxine?  "Yeah."  Was she said because Mummy and Daddy
spent so much time holding Maxine?  "Yeah."  So I explained to her
that when the new baby comes we will still love her just as much.
Then this morning when we were all in bed, she saw my big belly and
started crying, and we had to do it all again.  I expect we will have
the same conversation a few more times before September, and then some
more after the new baby comes.  I'm glad that Maxine came first to
help Delphine get used to the idea of a baby before having to confront
the reality of one.
