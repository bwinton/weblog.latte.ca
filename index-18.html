I am having something delivered to my parents' house, and
apparently they need the street address to deliver it.  But no-one
in rural Saskatchewan gets mail delivered to a street address, so
I only know their PO Box number!  I had to use Canada411 to look
up my own parents.

We went to the cardiologist for Cordelia's follow-up visit,
and as suspected she's fine.  The doctor couldn't find any
abnormality in the EKG or the ultrasound.  Like Dave said,
it was just a startup problem -- "Device driver not
initialized" or some such.
</p>
<p>
We do have to hold off on stimulant decongestants for the
next six months or so, though, just in case.  Obligingly 
enough, Cordelia
came down with a cold last night.  Fortunately we can still
give her nasal decongestant spray, bar none my favourite
cold remedy, so we did that and soon enough she was sleeping
soundly.

We're reading <em>Franklin Rides a Bike</em>.  It's all about how 
practicing at stuff makes you better (a lesson, incidentally,
that I didn't learn until I got to university, and then it was
only when I noticed how much better my typing was after spending
so much time on alt.kids-talk.  But I digress.)  <em>Franklin
Rides A Bike</em> says "Fox tried and
tried [to hit a baseball], and one day, he hit a home run!"
</p>
<p>
Delphine:  And who else hit a home run?<br>
Me: I don't know, who else?  Delphine?<br>
Delphine: Yeah.  And Mummy!  And Cordelia!<br>
Me: Did Zaida hit a home run?<br>
Delphine, in the tone of one speaking to the village idiot: No!
Zaida's a boy!
</p>
<p>
Huh.  I wish I could get into her head and figure out what
she thinks a home run is.
</p>

<hr width="40%">
<p>
Delphine can't pronounce "l"s.  It's not a big deal -- you're not
supposed to be able to pronounce everything until you're five.
But it gives her a unique accent, and I am always interested to
see what she substitutes for L.  Franklin is "Frankwin".  "Mary
had a little lamb" is "Mary had a yittle yamb".  And Cordelia
is just "Cordeeya", with a long Italian-style double-e.
</p>
<p>
I think she also uses "f" instead of "th", but I am so used to her
accent that I don't really notice.  (This happens to me a lot -- I
will get so used to mentally translating accents that I forget 
people have them.  I'm especially good at Chinese accents, but
it kind of blew my mind when I talked to a Chinese guy in England,
at my last job.  Instead of having a Canadian Chinese accent
he had an English Chinese accent.  It took me a few seconds
to recalibrate my accent filter and figure out what he was
saying.)

                    <h4>
<em>Anne of Avonlea</em> by Lucy Maud Montgomery</h4>
<p>
I wanted to know what happened next, so I read this book despite having
heard, on numerous occasions, that the other Anne books aren't as good
as <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>.  Well, they were right.  This is
almost comical in it's not-as-goodness.  Lousy characterization,
telling-not-showing, awkward dialogue.  I don't know what came over
LMM, but it wasn't good.  I wonder if her other stuff is good, or
if <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> was a freak occurrence.
</p>

<h4>
<em>Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering</em> by Robert L. Glass</h4>
<p>
Why am I reading about Software Engineering?  Because I have decided when
I grow up I would like to be a software manager.  Not a librarian or a
teacher or an opera singer or a photographer, or any of the other interesting
things which have come to mind in the last, oh, ten years.  No sir, I
am plunging headlong back into software, with ambition, this time.  
Ambition to become... <em>middle management</em>.
</p>
<p>
How do I know it will work out for me?  Because I am reading books like
this.  For fun!  And it was fun, and interesting and edifying (since
it is pretty much the first book I have read on the topic.)  Fortunately
Glass is not skimpy with his references, so I have a whole list of other
books to look up*.  Some of which I remember from the shelves of the
Computer Science Club.  Oh, how far I have come to be back where I
started.
</p>
<p>
* Most of which the Toronto Public Library doesn't own!  Argh!  Do they
care nothing for software engineering?  I will have to see how well 
their "buy this book for me" system works.  Also, if anyone has any 
recommendations on the topic, I would be glad to hear them.
</p>

<h4>
<em>Trickle Treat</em> by Laurie Boucke</h4>
<p>
This is a book about how to potty train your baby from infancy.  The
theory is sound and the author gives a pretty good description of how
to implement it. However, as with so many other parenting books, it
is bogged down the author's sense of superiority and her disdain for
those who parent any other way than hers.  She even goes so far as 
to imply (based on a single anecdote from a friend) that diapering
your child and subsequently potty training in toddlerhood will 
emotionally damage your child for life.  I am surprised the 
attachment parenting folks haven't gotten ahold of this method, it's
right up their alley.
</p>
<p>
Also the name makes me gag.

sort of know my way around the modules this time, and so I don't
expect many surprises to crop up.  So, to make my life both simpler
and more difficult at the same time, I've decided to try out a new
IDE.  That's right, instead of using IDEA, I'll be giving Eclipse a
trial run.  It hasn't been too bad so far, but I'm still kind of
getting it set up to do the things I need it to.</p>

<p>My three main motivations for using Eclipse on this project are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>I need to look at C++ code at the same time as Java code, since
      that's the only documentation we have for this project.</li>
  <li>The savings of an IDEA license are not inconsiderable.</li>
  <li>The co-worker who is working on it with me prefers Eclipse</li>
</ol>
Are they great reasons to switch?  Maybe, maybe not, but they're good
enough reasons to give it a try for a while.  It helps that I have
been using an older version of Eclipse for my Python development, so
I'm a little familiar with it.

                    <p>Yup, it's raining, and I'm commuting.  And so what happens?  I
bail.  This time I was changing lanes on Queen Street from the center
lane, across the streetcar tracks, into the outside lane in
preparation for turning right.  Now, on a dry day I can take those
streetcar tracks at about a 10° angle, but with the metal and
pavement being all wet, I guess I needed to be crossing it a little
more sharply.  Anyways, down I went.  I have a couple of slight
abrasions on my elbow and knee, but neither of them hurt as much as
wiping it down with the first-aid pad.  And it's another lesson
learned, making two.
<b><ol>
<li>Don't use your front brake in the rain.</li>
<li>Don't cross streetcar tracks sideways, especially in the rain.</li>
</ol></b>
At this rate, I'll have enough lessons to write a book by the time I'm 80.</p>

According to the 
<a href="http://www.babynamewizard.com/blog/2005/11/pop-quiz-nicknames.html">Baby
Name Wizard Blog</a>, Buffy is actually a nickname for Elizabeth.  
</p>
<p>
That's right.  We managed to name our girls Buffy and Cordelia.  I
think we should get some kind of prize.
