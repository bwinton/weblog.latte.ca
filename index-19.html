(This is going to be kind of boring for anyone who isn't me.
Precisely the kind of thing one shouldn't post on one's
website.)
</p>
<p>
Last year I apparently read around forty-five books -- those
were the ones I remembered to log, anyway, and I think I remembered
just about all of them last year.  I read eight of them from January
until May, and the other thirty-nine from June on -- yay, first
trimester fatigue.  Twenty-two since Cordelia was born -- yay,
breastfeeding!  I read fifteen fiction and
thirty-one non-fiction, and two collections of short stories.
I'm really into non-fiction these days; I find non-fiction books
to be more rich with ideas than novels are, and I'm very
keen on thinking about the world lately.  There's a lot to think
about...
</p>
<p>
I'm glad I started reading again -- for a while, starting in
high school, I hardly read at all, but I have learned so much
in the last few years from reading books written by clever people.
I shudder to think how boring and ignorant I would be if I 
hadn't read the books that I have read.
</p>
<p>
In short: books, good.  News at eleven.

<strong><em>Garbage Land: On the Secret Trail of Trash</em> by Elizabeth
Royte</strong>.  This is like the garbage version of the corpse book --
what happens to garbage when we throw it out.  I have only two things
to say: Royte is not as funny as Mary Roach, and people who deal
with garbage are much less keen to talk about it than people who
deal with bodies.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Long Way Round: Chasing Shadows Across the World</em>
by Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman</strong>.  This was pretty
good -- about the authors' motorcycle trip from London to New
York, overland (apart from that awkward Bering Strait bit).
Perhaps not surprisingly (being that they are both actors) they
seem like emotional types; I certainly wouldn't sign up to
bike around the world with either of them.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Talk to the Hand: The Utter Bloody Rudeness of the
World Today, or Six Good Reasons to Stay Home and Bolt the Door</em>
by Lynne Truss.</strong>   Truss is a grumpy woman, and I can't
say I disagree with her that people could stand to be more courteous,
but I think this book makes a lot more sense in England than it
does here -- Canadians are in general polite and friendly to
each other, just like the stereotype suggests.  Whereas the
English... not so much. 
</p>
<p>
Also Truss's Internet bears no relation to my Internet.  She
seems to conflate her technical problems with computers and
her problems with the culture of the Internet.  Anyway, some
of my best friends are from the Internet, so there.  (I had
a more reasoned response to this earlier, but it's been a while
since I finished the book and now I've forgotten what I was 
going to say.  Hmph.)
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, this book references a book which is also referenced
by the book I am currently reading (<em>American Backlash</em>
by Michael Adams) which I selected independently of the Truss
book.  The referenced book is called <em>Bowling Alone</em>
by Robert Putnam.  Does that mean I should read it?  Probably.
God, this reading will be the death of me.  Maybe I should give
up watching TV so I have a chance in hell of keeping up with my
own "to be read" list.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>With One Lousy Free Packet of Seed</em> by Lynne Truss.</strong>
Funny and a little silly.  Kind of Douglas Adams-ish, although
that might just be because it's an English comedic novel.  Also
kind of Jasper Ffordish, but without the annoyingly clever literary
references.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>I'll be the Parent, You Be the Child</em> by Paul
Kropp.</strong>  I got this from the Gender book, and I wasn't
sure what to expect, whether it would be a conservative, spare-the-rod
kind of thing, but to my pleasure it turned out to be by
a Toronto writer who wrote for my favourite parenting magazine.
It's a common-sense overview of various parenting issues, reviewing
the available evidence and giving the bottom line according
to Kropp.  Very sensible advice.  It made me think that I probably
don't want to work full-time until my children are grown -- that
the best thing I can give my children is my time.  But since I
would like to buy some new clothing before I am fifty, I will
be working part-time.
</p>
<p>
And now Cordelia would like some of that time, so I can write no
more.

<strong>1. Take more pictures.</strong>  More pictures of the
girls, and more pictures of the people in my life.  My sister-in-law
has a million pictures of her friends grinning at the camera,
taken at every event she ever has or goes to, or just for the
hell of it.  I didn't used to see the point of having all
those pictures of people, but looking back I wish I had more
pictures of the people in my life, and I wish my parents had
taken more pictures of their people; I have no pictures 
of my Aunt Delphine, and only one of my maternal grandparents,
and none of my paternal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. Read <em>Pere Goriot</em> and <em>King Lear</em>.</strong>
If I'm going to be all snotty and literary about my children's
names the least I can do is read the damn books.  I am such a 
poser.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. Learn to read better.</strong>  Oh, I'm fully literate,
but the stuff I read tends to bounce out of my head soon after
it goes in.  That's why I have the book log, so that I am forced
to think about each book at least once after I read it, and so
that I can refer back to the list and remember what I have read.
But I need to learn to read more deeply, to think more about
what I'm reading as I read it, and to remember it better.
To this end I would like to read <a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio/1929154178">this book</a>.  (I tried reading that <em>How
To Read and Why</em> book but it didn't help -- it was all
"why" and no "how".)
</p>
<p>
<strong>4. Learn to do the <a href="http://www.danielhsia.com/m_squat.php">Asian Squat</a>.</strong>  I spend a LOT of time squatting,
talking to Delphine, helping her with her boots and coat,
feeding the cats.  But I can't squat properly -- my heels
lift off the ground and I am left balancing on my toes,
which is very precarious.  I need to learn to do a proper
squat, and I don't understand why I can't.  I am going to
talk to my chiropractor, who is an absolute genius when
it comes to anatomy, about what I need to stretch and
strengthen to be able to do this.  And perhaps I should
watch this movie too.
</p>
<p>
<strong>5. Finish laundry the day I start.</strong>  I'm
pretty good at housework -- the place is generally fairly
clean, the kitchen gets cleaned once a day, I vacuum weekly,
I tidy up Delphine's toys every day or two, but I can't
seem to get a handle on laundry.  I wash and dry it in a
day, but then it sits unfolded in the living room for a
couple of days.  I finally fold it, and then it sits, folded,
in the living room for another day or two until I finally 
put it away, usually because I need the baskets to do more
laundry.    I don't think there is any trick to this, I think
I just need to fold and put away the damn laundry the day I
wash it.  It's a matter of self-discipline.  I hate that.

Delphine is going through changes:  she's gradually 
transforming from an obstinate and contrary two to a 
considerate and obedient three.  She no longer says "No!"
automatically.  She wants to please: when she is misbehaving
and Blake or I am annoyed she asks "Are you
happy?"; the two-year-old 
sometimes wins out, though:  "Are you happy?"  "No, Delphine,
I'm not happy."  "Yes!  You're happy!"
</p>
<p>
On Thursday she suddenly started asking "Why?", and it's a
favourite conversational gambit now.  It makes a pleasant 
change from "No".
</p>
<p>
She makes me laugh all the time. The other day as I was getting dressed I put a couple of
breast pads on the bed.  Delphine seized them and trotted
away, saying "I need pads because my boobies are dripping",
and clutched them to her little proto-boobs.  
</p>
<p>
Sometimes she doesn't like being laughed at, especially
when she's angry.  So she says "Don't laugh!", except
it comes out "Don' yaff!"  Which of course makes me 
yaff all the more.  Poor thing.
</p>
<p>
We haven't got anywhere with potty training; I was going
to put her in big girl pants this weekend because Blake's
got some time off, but I haven't yet.  It just seems like
a lot of work.  News at 11!  Parenting hard!  I have to get
on with it, though, because Delphine's totally ready.  She
spends ages making her Little People go to the bathroom
in her new Little People house.  All they seem to do is take
turns peeing, complete with pulling down of pants, and wiping
with toilet paper and washing hands.  She declares "I have
to pee" often.  The only thing she doesn't do is actually
use the toilet, and I figure that's only because so far she
hasn't had to.  A couple of accidents might convince her to
figure it out.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow.  I swear we will start tomorrow.

Cordelia turned three months old on Tuesday, and on Thursday she
rolled over from back to front for the first time.  She worked
really hard at it, starting with her legs and twisting her torso.
She had trouble figuring out what to do with the bottom arm for
a while, but she finally got it, and now she turns over as soon
as you put her down on her back on a flat surface.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that then she can't get back onto her back,
and she inevitably spits up and then gets really pissed at
having to lie with her face in a puddle of regurgutated
milk, so she protests until you flip her back over.  At which
point she rolls over and starts the whole process again.
</p>
<p>
Generally she continues to be a really smiley baby.  She
only cries when she has some particular need, and even then
she's quite polite about it.  
</p>
<p>
The exception to this is evenings,
when she yells vigorously for no apparent reason.  We alternately
rock her, nurse her, change her and set her down until she finally gets
tired of it and falls asleep.  I think once we institute a proper
bedtime early in the evening this problem will be solved (because
she will be sleeping).  I don't know when that will be, though.
Weissbluth says you can start putting your baby to sleep on
a schedule at four months, but I'm not sure when I can expect
her to get through the night without nursing.
</p>
<p>
I put up some <a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/2005/1208/">pictures</a>
and a couple of videos of Cordelia.  Enjoy!

My list of books read but not written about is getting unwieldy:
</p>
<h4>
<em>Death Sentences: How Cliches, Weasel Words and Management-Speak
are Strangling Public Language</em> by Don Watson</h4>
<p>
I think Don Watson is just a cranky guy.  I thought this would be a
good book, along the lines of <em>Eats, Shoot and Leaves</em>, but
it was mostly just Watson complaining vaguely about the way public
figures speak these days.
</p>
<p>
Don't get me wrong; I hate management speak and blather and bafflegab.  
I wish marketers and
athletes and politicians would use plain language and say what they
mean.  (Yesterday on TV they were interviewing the super of a building
which had had flooding due to a water main break.  The interviewer 
said "What about the possessions of the people with basement apartments,
are they destroyed?"  The super said "Well, there was extensive
flooding in the basement area of the building and that would include
the apartment areas, so the residents will experience some property
damage."  What would be wrong with "I'm afraid so, yes"?  Don't want
to cut short your fifteen minutes by being concise?
</p>
<p>
The problem with Watson's book is that he doesn't give enough examples
of what he doesn't like, and suggestions for improvement.  He also
asserts that this kind of imprecise language leads to imprecise or
even deceitful behaviour, but he doesn't give any examples or concrete
basis of any kind for that assertion.
</p>
<p>
I would give this book a miss.
</p>

<h4>
<em>102 Minutes: The Untold Story of the Fight to Survive Inside the
Twin Towers</em> by Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn</h4>
<p>
I felt a little bad about reading this book.  I thought, "I guess it's 
been long enough since September 2001 that I can read about the 
destruction of the World Trade Center for my amusement".  But this
isn't all that sensational; it's a description of how various individuals
coped, helped, and escaped (some of them) the attack.  
</p>
<p>
The book
also details how the attack and the collapse happened, with a 
focus on the myriad things which were done incompetently, or not
done at all.  Do you know when they tested the fireproofing for the
steel beams in the Towers?  Summer of 2004.  Yeah.  Although it
probably all shook off from the impact of the planes, anyway.
Generally it was a collosal fuckup in many ways.
</p>
<p>
The book is well- and engagingly-written and sheds light on how
decent people can be in a crisis.
</p>
<p>
Who should read this book:  I think Morgan might like it; normally
her thing is natural disasters but the man-made kind are interesting
too.
</p>
<h4>
<em>Making The Cat Laugh: One Woman's Journal of Single Life on the 
Margins</em> by Lynne Truss</h4>
<p>
This is like a really well-written blog of a clever, funny, single
English woman.  There's not much else to say about it, but I liked
it very much.
</p>
<p>
Who should read this book: my brother Dave would probably like it; in
fact I tried to send him a copy but my local Indigo didn't have it.
Kathryn should <em>definitely</em> read this book; I think she will
really enjoy the humour, and the English-ness of it.
</p>
<h4>
<em>Stiff: The Curious Life of Human Cadavers</em> by Mary Roach</h4>
<p>
This is a book about all the things that happen to human bodies after
they die.  Roach covers the usual stuff: burial and cremation; but 
she also goes into some weirder options: being rotted to study how
to determine time of death, being smashed into in the name of crash-test
research, being dissolved in lye or composted, being used to teach
anatomy, being cut up so your organs can be used to extend the 
lives of others, being plastinated...  being dead is almost as interesting
as being alive.
</p>
<p>
Roach is a very funny writer, and I look forward to reading more of
her work.
</p>
<p>
Who should read this book:  I think  Kate from The Usual Suspects might
like it; I think she liked <em>corpse</em>, which is a similar sort
of thing.  Maybe Morgan, too.
</p>
<h4>
<em>Why Gender Matters: What Parents and Teachers Need to Know About The
Emerging Science of Sex Differences</em> by Leonard Sax</h4>
<p>
This is a book which refutes the hippy-dippy idea that boys and girls
are naturally identical and any difference between their behaviour is
socially constructed, a fact which anyone with small children could
have told you is nonsense.  In fact, it's surprising it took this 
long to throw that idea out the window, since there's a pretty quick refutation:  
</p>
<p>
See, the hippy
idea is that the kid thinks something like this:
</p>
<p>
I am a boy.<br>
Boys play with trucks and balls.<br>
Therefore I must play with trucks and balls.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that kids as young as eighteen months show gender
differences in play, and eighteen-month-olds don't know if they're
a boy or a girl.  Delphine is two-and-a-half and she still asserts
her boyhood sometimes.  
</p>
<p>
Sax starts out with a description of what we know about the differences
between boys and girls,  then he gets into how to apply that knowledge
when raising or teaching children.  The advice seems pretty sound,
although he strays pretty far from gender-based advice
later in the book.
</p>
<p>
Who should read this book: Beth (thursday) because it might give her
some insight into her (very boyish) boys, Kathryn because she has
to deal with boys and girls every day at work, and Ellen because
I know she's interested in this stuff.

    <h4>
<em>Potty Training Your Baby: A Practical Guide for Easier Toilet Training</em> by 
Katie Van Pelt</h4>

<p>
I didn't actually get all the way through this book.  I threw it across
the room on the page where she suggests you don't have your child wash
their hands every time they go to the toilet because you don't want them
to think that peeing and pooing and private parts are dirty.  I have news 
for you, stupid
lady: peeing and pooing and private parts <em>are</em> dirty.  And if they 
aren't, your bathroom
probably is.  If you can't get straight in your head the difference
between literal, germy dirtiness and figurative, sexual dirtiness
then may I suggest you have a problem?  Also, I'm not shaking hands 
with you.
</p>
<p>
She also suggests that there is an epidemic of adult constipation
caused by parents being negative about their kids' poo in childhood.
She provides no evidence, of course, but apparently if you so much
as wrinkle your nose at your child's fetid diapers, you will damage
them and their bowel health for life.
</p>
<p>
And last but not least, she says you can't possibly begin potty training
until nine months, which directly contradicts the <em>Trickle Treat</em>
book, which incidentally comes off as the height of reasonableness
compared to this one.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, I'm almost sorry I read about potty training.  I got more
value out of a conversation I had with another mum at the library than
I have out of these books.  I have decided I am just going to switch
Delphine to big girl pants in the new year, and clean up messes until
she figures it out.  What the hell, I launder diapers anyway, and
it's not like I have expensive carpets.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, both I and a friend with kids the same age have decided
we will put our babies on the potty as soon as possible this time around.
No more waiting for them to figure it out on their own.
In fact, her six-month-old has already peed in the potty more times than her two
and a half year old.

<h4>
<em>Men's Style: The Thinking Man's Guide to Style</em> by Russell Smith</h4>
<p>
Russell Smith is a men's fashion columnist for the Globe and Mail, and
he has written this book about men's fashion.  He covers the history 
of modern men's fashion and gives instructions on such things as how to
tie different tie knots, or what "black tie" means, as well as giving
his opinion on various style options.  As such this is a useful reference
book and I might even buy a copy.  
</p>
<p>
It's also very funny, particularly when he says "if you do such and such,
you will look like a..." whatever.  I already sent the book back to the
library so I can't give you any quotes, you'll just have to read it yourself.
</p>
<p>
I can't agree with all his style opinions, though.  I think a man in a
sweater can be very attractive, and rust is a fine colour.  He's right about
three-piece suits, though: SEXY.
