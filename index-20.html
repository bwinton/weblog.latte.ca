This morning Delphine slept late, and she was in an exceptionally chatty
mood when she woke up.  She came into bed with farting on the mind,
and asked,
</p>
<p>
"Who farted?"
</p>
<p>
"I don't know," I said, "who?"
</p>
<p>
"I think Zaida farted."
</p>
<p>
"Yeah?"
</p>
<p>
"Zaida has a big white moustache.  And hair.  His hair
match his moustache."  A pause.  "Zaida is very old."

Due to an ill-advised combination of drinks last night (cherry
beer plus sweet wine plus cider) I woke up with a killer
headache and no small amount of nausea.  It was miserable;
you would think by thirty I would know how to drink sensibly.
I didn't even get drunk!  It was just all the alcopop.
</p>
<p>
But the best part is that my back, which has been troubling
me for weeks, feels fantastic today;  no aching or tightness
or alarming stabbing pains. I'm not sure if it's coincidence
or the muscle relaxant properties of alcohol, or what, but 
I am very pleased.  (Now that my headache and nausea is gone.)

I wrote a bit <a href="http://baby.latte.ca/name.html">about Cordelia's 
name</a>.
</p>
<p>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the cheesy Cordelia song.  It might not
be Chris De Burgh, because I couldn't find anything on the 'net.  It
goes "Cordelia!  Let's (something) away the night together, let's
(something) 'til the stars fall down from the sky".  It's really cheesy,
y'all, but I can't find it anywhere on the Internet.  Isn't this what
the Internet is for?

The sub-title says it all.  This is a book of value both to those
both looking for advice on child-rearing and looking for guidance
on how to live according to Jewish teachings.
</p>
<p>
The thing that strikes me, as a secular Christian, about Judaism
is that it provides so much guidance on how to live daily life.
Judaism takes the sacred out of the temple or the church and puts
it in the home, it takes the worshipping out of the hands of the
priests and shamans and puts it in the hands of the mothers and
fathers.  (I guess that's what comes of centuries of persecution --
you spread your faith around so it always survives.  Kind
of the distributed computing of religions.) 
</p>
<p>
Conveniently for the rest of us, Jewish teachings with respect
to the home and the raising of children are eminently sensible
and time-tested.  This book has advice about how to appreciate
your children, how to get them to appreciate (that is, respect)
you, how to teach them gratitude, get them to do chores, 
discipline them.  The author is a psychiatrist and a mother, too,
so she puts the teachings in a modern perspective.  She's also
pretty funny.
</p>
<p>
This is a useful book and an easy read, and has lots of good
recommendations for other books -- in fact, I might get this
out of the library again just for the bibliography (some of the
books she references aren't applicable to my children just yet).
You will also learn lots of useful Hebrew words like <em>yetzer
hara</em>.  (Maybe that's Yiddish?  She doesn't say.)

<strong><em>Never Let Me Go</em> by Kazuo Ishiguro</strong> is a science fiction
book by a non-science fiction author.  As such it's kind of implausible from an
sf point of view because Ishiguro isn't trying to create a rigorous, believeable
universe to satisfy nerds like me, he's creating an allegory to make a point.  So
I guess it's not really science fiction; I'm not sure what you would call it.
Anyway, it's very good and quite sad. And I guess it's not all that unbelieveable.
It depends how pessimistic you are feeling.

<p>
<strong><em>Race Against Time</em> by Stephen Lewis</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is a collection of essays originally delivered as the 2005 Massey Lectures.
Stephen Lewis is the United Nations' Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa and boy,
is he pissed.  Basically we are all screwing over Africa because we can't be bothered
to spend the few bucks it would take to treat and prevent AIDS and thereby rescue
an entire continent from tragic poverty and remove from the world yet another
hatching ground for un-parented proto-terrorists.  (He doesn't say that thing
about terrorists, that's mine.)  
</p>
<p>
Africa is full of child-led and grandmother-led
families and it's heartbreaking and sickening how we continue to turn our backs
on it.  Africa is a magical land rich with resources and cultures and the rest of
the world has metaphorically hit it over the head, stolen its lunch money, kicked
it in the ribs and is now walking away.  Call your representatives and tell them
it is time to look after Africa.
</p>
<p>
Also Stephen Lewis is smart and strong and noble and brave, even if I did make fun
of his daughter-in-law here a while back.

<strong><em>American Backlash: The Untold Story of Social Change in The United States</em> by
Michael Adams</strong>
</p>
<p>
Michael Adams is the head of a polling company which has done extensive 
polling of Americans and discovered that the true divide in American
values isn't between Republicans and Democrats but between politically
engaged citizens and those who couldn't give a rat's ass.  And it's the
values of the non-rat's-ass-givers which are leading the trajectory of
social change in American from respect and independence to hedomism and
individualism.  So he says.   He also talks about how the two parties can
reach undecided voters, and why the Democrats are having their asses
whupped so bad lately.
</p>
<p>
He makes some pretty compelling arguments, but
now I am more interested to read <em>Fire and Ice</em>, which compares
Canadian values to American values.
</p>
<p>
I think Jon Stewart should read this book, except he probably already has.
Although maybe not, because I'm not sure this book has been published
in the US.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>How to Simply Cut Children's Hair: A Step-by-Step Guide to Cutting, Perming
and Highlighting Children's Hair</em> by Laurie Punches</strong>
</p>
<p>
This book seemed pretty useful and I might get it out again once Delphine is old
enough to sit still while I try and cut her hair.  And before she gets old enough
that she is too cool to have a home haircut.  So that will be a, what, two week
window?  The book blurb says "Exploration is part of the adventure" -- let me assure you
that an eleven-year-old does not want you having any adventures with her hair.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally I should look up books on how to cut my own hair -- I am meeting
more and more people who cut their own hair and I think I should try it.  Fifty
bucks every six weeks is just too much money.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Leading a Software Development Team: A Developer's Guide to Successfully
Leading People &amp; Projects</em> by Richard Whitehead</strong>
</p>
<p>
Like it says in the title, this book is written for developers so it sometimes
left me wondering whether I can make it as a software manager.  Whitehead talks a
lot about design and architecture, saying that it's important to take the time
to come up with a good design before you begin coding. I understand that that is 
important but
I am not sure that I would be able to tell if my team had come up with a good
design.  Actually, no,
I think I would be able to tell if we had a lousy design, but I'm not sure
I would be able to convince my team that I'm right.  Perhaps the only problem is
one of confidence.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, because the book is written for developers it leaves one with the impression
that the only good team lead or project manager is someone who started off coding;
I don't think that's true but I need to read "A Non-Developer's Guide to Successfully
Leading Software People and Projects" or some such book to get an idea of my 
career trajectory.  I need to decide how much time to dedicate to being in
development before I can move into project management -- none?  Five years?
Ten?  Or maybe I will go through testing instead.
</p>
<p>
Did I really just say that?
Am I insane?  How passionately did I swear that I would never ever do testing again?
Can I really go back into a job I hated and love it and make a career out of it?
Has my attitude improved that much?  I just don't know.
</p>
<p>
Still, this is a very good and useful book that covers many areas of project
management, from technical issues to decision making to managing team members
to dealing with lousy bosses.  Blake is going to read it too.  The only worrying
thing is that the author photograph very flatteringly makes the author look
about 32 so I'm not sure I trust him.

I have too much stuff in too little space, and I don't have
the resources to reduce the stuff or increase the space.
My hair looks like hell and is constantly, annoyingly in my eyes.
I have a premobile baby whose every physical need is my
responsibility, and a stubborn toddler whose emotional
upheavals are severely trying my already limited patience and
empathy.  I have so many things to do and I haven't any idea
how or when to start.
</p>
<p>
My skin is so dry that every time I move my bra feels like
sandpaper on my raw back, and my hands make me cry to look
at them.  My feet are revoltingly calloused and I haven't
painted my nails since before Christmas.  All my clothes 
are old and ill-fitting, and I couldn't make myself look
respectable even if I had the time and space to do so.
</p>
<p>
But instead of dealing with any of these problems, or just
waiting for them to pass, I bake.  Please, come over and
eat my cookies and carrot cake and banana bread.  And while
you're here you can help me get rid of some crap.  Or maybe
just hold the baby while I fix my toenails.

Cordelia's almost four months old.  It seems like longer,
somehow; it seems like she has been with us for a long,
long time.  But it also seems like she's developing 
faster than Delphine did, because we have been down this
route before.  You know how the first time you go on a
journey it seems to take a really long time, because you're
not sure where you're going or when you will get there,
but after that first time the trip seems much shorter?
That's what's happening here.  I'm enjoying this
slightly boring and annoying helpless-baby stage because I know
from experience that it does end some day, so it's easy
to brush off the annoying parts and appreciate the
sweet, squishy, fun parts.  Everyone should have two
children: a practice one and a fun one.
</p>
<p>
She has an astonishing smile; her cheeks puff out and
her eyes crinkle and she shows all her gums and it's like
you are sharing the most wonderful joke ever.  It makes
you feel like you are the most splendid person she has
ever met; if
she keeps this smile all her life she will break hearts
and win votes left and right.
</p>
<p>
She still hasn't rolled over the other way more than a
couple of times; she ends up on her belly and stays there
until she gets mad and someone responds to her protests
by rolling her back over.
</p>
<p>
I tried to put her to bed at bedtime yesterday, but it
didn't work; she didn't sleep.  I think she's still too
young to have developed the two-naps-and-an-overnight-sleep
pattern yet.  She does sleep from eleven until seven, with
us, though.  Sometimes she wakes up in the middle for  
a nurse, but most often not these days.
</p>
<p>
She's learned how to grab things and stick them in her
mouth -- she loves to chew stuff.  I think she might be
cutting a tooth.  I remember it seemed like forever before
Delphine learned to grab things, and now I'm shocked at
how soon Cordelia can do it.  Right now she is mowing 
down on a rubber elephant chew toy and making satisfied
grunty sighing noises.

    <p>
How many times have I publically declared that we will start
potty training TOMORROW here?  Three?  Four?  Guess what we
still haven't done?  
</p>
<p>
I think I have overloaded myself with information on this
matter because I flip-flop, literally every day, between
(in a deep, gruff voice) Being The Boss and telling 
Delphine it's time to start using the potty, or (in a
light, floaty, slightly mocking voice) Waiting until She
Is Ready.  The consensus in modern theory seems to lean
towards letting her decide, with vague handwaving talk of
Negative Consequences if I force the issue.  At this point
I am leaning towards going with the consensus on the 
basis that if it turns out to be the wrong decision I
can pull out the "everyone was doing it" defense.  That's
not a defense I have a lot of respect for, though.
</p>
<p>
This is complicated and irritated by the fact that Delphine
has decided to stop pooping.  Pooping is unpleasant and
smelly and generally beneath someone such as her.  However 
her body didn't get the memo, so at around 4:00 every day
(her body would like to be regular) I am faced with a two-year-old
frantically waddling around, penguin-style, moaning "My
bum hurts!  My bum is sore!"  Every third day or so her
body wins.
</p>
<p>
Altogether this means I am spending much more time than
I would like to thinking about, talking about, and
reading about poop.  (Did you know Everybody Poops?  I
have a book that says so.)  I am done.  I need a poop
holiday.
</p>
<p>
Everything else is going okay, though.  We are reading
more and more meaty books (I even got a picture-book
version of <em>The Secret Garden</em>!) together.  
We just discovered Curious George, which I don't remember
reading as a kid but quite like now.  I gather there is
a movie coming out -- we will be sure not to go.  (I think
two-and-a-half is too young to sit through a whole movie.
She can hardly pay attention through a 20-minute Baby
Einstein DVD.) 
</p>
<p>
We still don't watch much TV with her.  She gets one or two
20 minute DVDs a week, and we almost always watch with her.
Actually, she watched TV by herself for the first time 
yesterday, while I did a Grocery Gateway order.  I felt
strangely neglectful and inclined to crack open a can of
cheap beer and light a cigarette.
</p>
<p>
(Actually I think I might buy some beer this weekend.  Maybe
some popcorn too.)
</p>
<p>
She has lots of dollies now: a Cabbage Patch baby named Phoebe 
from Baba, 
a homemade rag doll (with no fixed name that I can ascertain)
from my mother, and her first dolly, a
rag doll named Boy which Auntie J'Anne gave her.  
She also has a variety of stuffed animals, which rotate in
and out of her favour.  My favourite is a purple and orange
orangutan-type thing named George.  She likes 
to put her babies to sleep, and push them around in her push cart,
and generally leave them underfoot for me to step on and 
swear.  (I am turning into my mother.)  Phoebe and the rag
doll are both naked at all times, as were my dolls when I
was a child.  The only reason Boy has clothes is that they 
are stitched on.
</p>
<p>
She also likes to play with the Fisher-Price Little People
house I got her for Christmas, and to draw and colour.  Her
drawings are getting more representational, they are no
longer just scribbles.  Now they're circles and lines which
are arbitrarily (probably not to her) assigned meaning: this
blob with lines coming out is a mouse, and this smaller blob
is a banana.  She likes to help in the kitchen too; she stirs
things.  That's about all I let her do so far, since she's
clearly too young for fire and sharp things.
</p>
<p>
She's cute; she's lovely; she's funny and interesting and I
like her very much.
