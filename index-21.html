It's not a bad idea to go to the 
<a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpsclist.asp">CSPC</a> website and sign
up for their email notifications of product recalls.  Right now I
am obsessively staring at the page about  bracelets that came 
free with Reebok sneakers.  They have high lead content and a
four-year-old girl died from swallowing part of one.  I mean,
can you fucking <em>imagine</em>?  
</p>
<p>
Incidentally there are lots of recalls for cheap dollar-store
and vending machine jewellery containing lead.  I think we will
have a "no cheap tacky-ass jewellery" rule in this house.

If you are, perchance, looking for a hydrocortisone preparation,
perhaps for a rash which has mysteriously appeared on your
oldest daughter's hand, and you should happen to notice that
of the three preparations available, "cream", "ointment" and
"lotion", the lotion seems to be the best deal, you should 
know that said lotion is in fact largely composed of isopropyl
alcohol.  Whoever thought it was a good idea to sell ALCOHOL
to put on RASHES deserves some kind of Stupid award, which they
can share with me for buying it without reading the ingredients
list.  I am going to see if I can return it for a refund tomorrow.

First I want to say that the idea of this unsolicited 
advice is to publish things that I have learned through
my own experience that I did not read about elsewhere,
in books or in magazines, or that I read so many 
conflicting recommendations about that I might as well
have not read any.  I'm trying to avoid all the really
obvious stuff, or the stuff which is widely published.
But what I've learned is that all babies are
different, and what worked for me might not work for 
you, so take this for what it is; advice born from the
experience of one (well-read, intelligent) mother of
two (really easy) children.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Diaper cream</strong> is one of those things which
everyone has a different recommendation for, which leads
me to believe that different things work for different
babies.  All I have to say here is that diaper creams
which contain fish oil will make your baby smell like
a salmon cannery, and if you use cloth diapers they will
continue to smell fishy even after laundering.  Read 
labels carefully, and try all the other kinds of diaper 
cream first.
</p>
<p>
Okay, one more thing.  Johnsons 3-in-1 Diaper Cream and
Aveeno Diaper Cream have exactly the same ingedients and
are made by the same company, so buy the one that's on
sale.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p><strong>Bathing</strong> babies is something that I have
never quite figured out.  They're too big for the kitchen
sink (assuming your kitchen sink is clean enough anyway)
and too small for the tub, and I can't stomach spending
money on one of those in-bath baby holders (which Health 
Canada advises against anyway).  They're slippery as 
hell, they hate being bathed, and how dirty does a baby
get anyway?  I resolved the problem by just not
bathing my babies very often, until they're old enough
to sit up and manage the whole process more-or-less 
by themselves, as Delphine is.  And she still only gets
a bath twice a week.  Who has time for more?
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
This is probably too late for the unindentified target
for this advice, but perhaps not for you:  get yourself
a <a href="http://www.babytrekker.com/">BabyTrekker</a>.
They are so much better than the other comparable 
products I don't even want to go into it.  They are
way more comfortable, distribute the weight of the baby
much more sensibly over your body, and they carry up
to 40 lbs, which is considerably more than Delphine 
weighs at almost three years of age.  (I don't let her
go in the Trekker any more because I think it looks
silly.  I am so mean.)  Plus you can use them as a front
or backpack.  I love my Trekker.  I just wish they
had come out with the Tasteful Taupe model when we bought
ours; we have Fugly Forest Green.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
You're going to need to get yourself a <strong>5 ml
medication syringe</strong>. Lots of medications for 
babies come with 1 mL rubber bulb syringes, which not 
only make it hard to get the right dosage into the syringe
(and then into the baby),
but are often too small to contain the whole dose at
once.  For example, I needed to give Cordelia some 
Tempra, which comes with a 1 mL bulb dispenser, but
I needed to give her 1.25 mL.  That means I have to
go through the measuring part twice, AND the horribly
traumatic squeezing it into the unwilling child's mouth
part twice.  She's no slouch, and once she's learned that
the syringe means foul pink unction, the next part of the
dose is going to end up in her ear.
</p>
<p>
The good news is that some medications come with the
good kind of syringe (I think Tylenol is one of them)
so don't throw that out after the medication is done,
keep it in your first aid kit.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
Something more metaphysical to end (because Cordelia's
awake now).  I had trouble, with Delphine, understanding
that she is just a baby for a little while.  Intellectually,
of course, I understand that she's going to grow up, but
in some more primitive part of my brain it seemed that
every day of not enough sleep, too many diapers and no
time to do housework, let alone read, was just the first
day of thousands more of the same.  I guess, having never
watched a baby grow up before, I didn't really believe it would
happen.  And it makes sense; any changes in my life until
now I have effected through my own labour: I took a course,
or looked for a new job, or bought a new condo, or whatever.
I'm not used to standing by and watching my life change
outside of my own volition.
</p>
<p>
It's much easier with Cordelia.  When I have a horrible
day when all she wants is to be held all day, and I have
laundry and vacuuming and cooking to do and nothing is
getting done, I know that this is just temporary, that
eventually she will be able to walk and talk and play
by herself, and she won't need me every single minute.
That makes it much easier.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, it seems this is a hard lesson to learn;
I still have moments which I think the Delphine is going
to be a whiny, needy, contrary toddler forever, even
though I know, logically, that one day she will be a 
pleasant and helpful three-year-old.  I just can't
see how it will happen, because I haven't seen it 
happen before.

Yes, poor Delphine hasn't been getting much screen time here, we're
too busy with the baby and books and unsolicited advice.  But she's
still here, very much so.
</p>
<p>
Delphine is...  funny.  Delphine likes to pretend.  When she pretends
to do something, like open a pretend suitcase or put on a pretend
boot, she makes a "shhhick" noise, her own all-purpose sound effect.
(She learned that from her Daddy, the master of sound effects.)
</p>
<p>
The other day Delphine and Daddy were going to the pretend beach,
and Daddy had to put on a pretend wetsuit, so Delphine helped. 
She pulled it up over his legs and arms and zipped the pretend
zip up the front.  Then Daddy had to put on a pretend sunhat; 
Delphine patted it around his head as if she were encasing him
in playdough, and then, with a flourish, tied it under his chin with a
huge, pretend bow.  It was at that point that I bust
a gut laughing; Delphine didn't see the humour, and so left the
room.  Blake asked "Where are you going?"
</p>
<p>
"To the swimming pool."  
</p>
<p>
"Should I swim to the pool with you?" 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah."
</p>
<p>
So Blake did <em>the worm</em> out of
the room, oscillating along the floor.  I think I actually 
died from laughing and I'm typing
this from the afterlife.  Kids are funny, and if your husband
happens to be funny too, you've hit the jackpot.  (Even if
no-one else thinks he's funny, it still counts.)
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
Delphine's into fairy tales.  She likes "Goldilocks", "The Three
Little Pigs", "Little Red Riding Hood", "Henny Penny" and "The 
Three Billy Goats Gruff".  Reading fairy tales to her has made me
realize how common fairy tale references are; they're everywhere.
I am so pleased and excited to be introducing her to this piece
of our culture. This is why I became a mother: I get such pleasure
from reading, from knowing about things, from recognizing things
in unexpected places, from putting ideas together, 
from intellectual life in general, and I am so keen to share 
that with my children.  I guess this is why athletic types like
to take their kids out to play ball and stuff, and why it's so
purturbing to have a child who doesn't share your way of
thinking.
</p>
<p>
We've also started reading Dennis Lee poems, and she has a 
few of them memorized.  "Mumbo, Jumbo, Christopher Columbo,
sitting on the sidewalk chewing bubble gumbo; I think I catch
a WHALE; I think I'll catch a snail; I think I'll sit around
a while, chewing bubble gumbo."  It's nice to have these
things in your head so you have something to say
to yourself while you're, you know, in the shower or walking
around.  She has an uncanny recall for text and poems; yesterday
I caught her reciting entire paragraphs of "Henny Penny" to 
herself.  I don't know if that's unusual or just part of the
incredible learning machine that is a little kid's brain.
</p>
<p>
But I'm glad to be filling it with these things; what do kids
who aren't read to talk about to themselves?
</p>
<p>
She's about, oh, eighty percent potty trained.  How did we do
it?  I don't really know.  We read lots of books about it, 
and talked about it a lot, and worried about 
it a lot, but we didn't reward her or coax her (much).  In the
end she has almost potty trained herself, just like the books
said she would.  
</p>
<p>
She still chooses to wear pull-ups some days,
but she always poops in the toilet, and when she pees in her
diaper it's because she has decided to do so.  How do I know?
Because she tells me about it.  "Do we pee in diapers?"  "Yeah,
you can pee in your diaper.  Do you want to go pee in the toilet?"
"No, I will pee in my diaper."  Waits...  "I need a new diaper."
Fortunately she can change her own diaper now.  Hooray for
pull-ups!
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, according to that history of childcare book I read,
apparently the potty training of Louis the somethingth of France
started when he was eighteen months, and ended when he was around
three, so this timetable for toileting isn't some product of our
degenerate times and diaper companies;  it's just when the brain
is ready.  (Although I still think you can train, in the Pavlovian
sense, your baby or young toddler to go in the potty if you work on
it.)
</p>
<p>
What else?  She dresses herself, although not usually as promptly
as I would like her to.  She loves to wear her yellow rain jacket
and gets very angry when she has to wear her snowsuit instead.
She eats, but not very much, and I am afraid I don't make fruit
and vegetables enough of a priority.  When you only eat (apparently)
half a cup of food a day, it's easy to fill yourself up with meat
and bread.  I am trying harder.
</p>
<p>
This weekend we had our first bona fide scary toddler-running-into-traffic
moment (and hopefully our last).  There wasn't really any traffic, it
was a little tiny street next to a park and there weren't any cars on
it, but it was still very bad and there was angriness and a stern 
talking to.  What happened was that she was wandering around the park
with a friend, and neither she nor her friend were responding to 
me or the friend's mother calling their names.  They got a little too
far away from us and too close to the street, and just wandered out
between the parked cars.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure whether,
at this age, I should expect her to respond to verbal commands (and
I have just failed to instill that in her), or
whether she's still young enough that I need to stay close
and keep control over her physically.  Either way, I will definitely 
stay closer to her from now on, in potentially alarming situations
like that.

Cordelia is five -- actually five and a half -- months old, but
she's growing out of nine-month sized clothes, and fitting nicely
into twelve month clothes.  She is freaky huge.  Fortunately she
is freaky strong, too; she can sit up for minutes at a time.  And
she's working on crawling, but she hasn't gotten much past the 
lying on her tummy, kicking and getting really pissed off stage 
yet.  She shuffles
her way around the living room quite effectively, though, usually
ending up near the (moving) glider rocker ottoman, ready to have a 
leg broken or a head bonked.  I have
said it before, and I'll say it again: it's astonishing how quickly
and how far a supposedly non-mobile baby can move.
</p>
<p>
All the reference books, and the doctor, would like to know if she is
cooing.  I don't know about your babies, but my babies don't "coo".
Mostly she makes this noise which I haven't been able to come up
with a word for, because nothing else on god's earth makes it; it's
most like a groan, with some kvetch thrown in.  Like, 
<em>Heeeeeaaaaagh</em>.  And that's when she's happy.  
No-one could ever call it cooing.
</p>
<p>
(Does anyone's baby coo?  My friend Ellen's baby Maxine makes these
awesome hellmouth, troll noises: <em>GRREEEAAAAUUuuuuch</em>.)
</p>
<p>
We started her on cereal (even though they are saying now that you
should wait until six months) because she was so desperate to be
part of this eating thing that everyone else is doing.  She's done
rice, barley and oatmeal baby cereals so far, and she doesn't hate
them.  Once she passes six months I am going to start her on 
vegetables, and then she will see what the excitement is really 
about.  Carrots!  Parsnips!  Oh my!  (Oh, unless those are the
ones with nitrates; I will have to look that up.)
</p>
<p>
I was kind of sad to start her on food; I thought, "this is the
last time I will have a baby who exclusively breastfeeds".  I 
expect I will have thoughts like that a lot.  It was a brief moment,
though; really I am very much looking forward to having two little
girls, rather than a little girl and a baby.  Babies are nice but
little girls are better.
</p>
<p>
We're tiptoeing around the bedtime thing, thinking about it.  Right
now Cordelia's sleep, especially in the daytime, is pretty disordered,
and I know she's old enough now (and definitely big enough!) to have
a proper two-nap schedule, rather than the three or four mini-naps she's
taking now.  I also think she's old enough (and again, big enough) to
go through the night without nursing; the trick now is to teach her
that.  
</p>
<p>
Last night we put her in the crib (already asleep) in the
evening, and we had the evening mostly to ourselves.  She woke up a
couple of times, and both times we soothed her back to sleep and then
put her back in the crib.  I expect at some point we will put her in
the crib and let her cry herself to sleep (because we are SO MEAN!  And
because it worked so well with Delphine), but I want to get her used
to the idea that the crib is safe, and for sleeping, first.  (Until 
now she has mostly slept in the high chair or on my lap or in bed
with us.)
</p>
<p>
Generally she continues to be a charming and sweet baby.  She's not
so ready with the smiles for strangers any more, but she still 
blesses Blake and I with the huge, gummy, ear-to-ear grin that I 
hope she never grows out of.

<strong><em>Your Three-Year-Old: Friend or Enemy</em> by 
Louise Bates Ames and Frances Ilg</strong> is useful, like
the two-year-old version.  They're pretty old (this one
is from the mid-eighties) so they're weirdly time-capsulish.
This one gives a suggested plan for your kid's third birthday,
and it's all "you should be able to manage this with the
help of two or three other mothers".  Presumably Father is
in the drawing room smoking his pipe?
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Your Call Is Important To Us: The Truth about
Bullshit</em> by Laura Penny</strong>.  It must be very hard
to write about bullshit, because 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/books/_2005/december24.html">Don
Watson</a> tried to do it, and failed, and now there's this.  It
started off pretty well, but eventually turned into an 
all-purpose lefty jeremiad, with the usual anti-corporate,
anti-globalization, anti-consumer (Evian is naive spelled
backwards!) stuff.  
Not so much with the bullshit.  She also handily ignores
the great steaming heaps of the stuff generated by leftish
groups like anti-GM protesters; as if conservatives have
a monopoly on bullshit!
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Me and Mr. Stenner</em> by Evan Hunter</strong>.  I
was glad to find out that Evan Hunter is the pseudonym of 
Ed McBain (actually, vice versa, but I'm  not sure what the
latin for "real name" is) and that he's written a million books.
This one is a book for young adults, and I really enjoyed it.
Hunter is a genius at capturing dialogue, and this is no different,
except it is set (and written) in 1976 so the dialogue is
kind of quaint.  I wish he had written more young adult books --
this is as good as Judy Blume.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Perfect Parents: Baby-care Advice Past and Present</em> 
by Christina Hardyment</strong> is a book which chronicles the changes in
advice given to parents from the 1700s until now.  This is a lovely
book because it makes you realize that despite all the crazy-ass
things people have done with their children, society still seems
to chug along.  It was a surprise to me how much variation there
has been in childcare practices; I had a vague idea that in the
Olden Days everyone was really strict, and now everyone is really
permissive, and that's all there is to it, but really there has
been a lot more subtlety in parenting practices over the centuries.
Hardyment is a historian, so there is a lot of discussion about
how historical events like wars inform parenting.
</p>
<p>
I would recommend this book to anyone who is annoyed or bewildered
by the variety of advice out there.  I only wish it were newer,
so I could hear what Hardyment has to say about the judgemental
insanity that is Dr. Sears and attachment parenting.  (Which is, 
like the curate's egg, good in parts.)
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Blackboard Jungle</em> by Evan Hunter</strong>.  Evan Hunter --
Ed McBain -- wrote <em>The Blackboard Jungle</em>!  Cool!  So I had
to take it out of the library and have a read.  It's really good.
Can I just stop saying that Hunter/McBain books are really good?
That would save some typing.  It's about a novice teacher dealing
with the, well, crap of working at an inner-city vocational school.
There is an especially good rant in the middle about vocational
schools and teaching and what does it all mean?
</p>
<p>
Obviously, I think this would be a really interesting book for
Kathryn to read since she is also a novice teacher dealing with
lots of crap, but I am reluctant to because if she didn't like it
I would be very sad.  So Kathryn, I recommend this book but if
you don't like it please don't say anything!

You know how all makeup claims it's the best thing since they
invented makeup, and it will change your life?  Well, Cover Girl 
LashExact won't change your life, but it does do what it claims, which
is not clump.  As far as I can tell the goo in the bottle is
the same as ever, but the wand is new technology; it's not
regular bristles like a normal mascara brush, but little plastic
bristles very evenly spaced.  It works a dream.

<p>
The next thing I like is something my mother sent us, a set of
three CDs called <a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=6717773&amp;style=music&amp;cart=312913608&amp;BAB=E">100 Silly Songs</a>. 
It has every kid's song you have ever heard, plus a few
that haven't been heard for decades because they're quite
politically incorrect, like "The King of the Cannibal
Islands", or "I Wish I Were A Little Bar of Soap".  They're 
all nicely arranged and well-sung, with
complete verses.  It's almost like a reference CD.
</p>
<p>
The last thing I have bought that I like is my new
<a href="http://www.myfullerbrush.com/tidy.htm">crumb sweeper</a>.
I didn't get that brand -- mine is much cuter -- but the idea
is the same.  It works really well at picking up the crumbs
off the tablecloth after Delphine the barbarian has
eaten -- I just, swoosh, sweep it across the table and the
crumbs are gone as if by magic.  
(I use a tablecloth because our table is wood and I
want to keep it nice until the children have manners and are
less prone to drumming on the table with their forks and
such.)  I am looking forward to the post-croissant cleanup on
Sunday.

First I need to add a couple of things about the high chair.
You probably already have a thousand thin flannel receiving
blankets -- if you don't now is a good time to go get some,
or better, find a friend (or an aunt with a friend) who has
a serger, and get them to make you a bunch of two foot by
two foot squares of flannel.
</p>
<p>
Once you have your pile of blankets, fold one up so that it
lines the high chair under the baby.  Then when the
inevitable explosive poo happens you will only have to 
wash the blanket, not the entire high chair cover.  Repeat
as necessary for bouncy chair, car seat, stroller, etc.
</p>
<p>
You'll also need a rolled up hand towel to prop next to
the baby in the high chair, so she doesn't topple over
sideways.

this.</a>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Diapers</h4>
<p>
I haven't come across a brand of diapers which isn't perfectly 
adequate.  They all seem to do the trick, store-brand or name-brand
alike.  Huggies are a little nicer in that they are softer and
stretchier, but they don't objectively function any better.  Pampers
are just weird because they are scented:  why?  If you get
on Huggies' mailing list they will send you big fat coupons on
a regular basis, so you can feel a bit better about spending
huge piles of money on diapers, but I'm not sure how I got on
the list.  Maybe just email them and ask?
</p>
<p>
Wipes, on the other hand, are not all created equal.  The cheap
brands all seem to be smooth and thin and useless at sponging up
poop.  We stick with Huggies-brand wipes when we're out, and wet washcloths
when we're home, which you probably won't want to do unless you
launder your own cloth diapers.  Huggies are more expensive, but
since you probably use twice as many of the cheap kind maybe
it works out in the end.  There might be other good brands out
there, but I'm warning you, buy a small package to start off
with because you don't want to be stuck with 200 lousy wipes.
</p>
<p>
I don't think you're using cloth diapers because you're not
INSANE, but if you do and you wash them yourself, let me tell
you the big secret:  use Tide.  There is all sorts of advice
out there to have two diaper pails, or to soak overnight, or
to rinse with vinegar, blah dee blah dee blah.  I just stick
the diapers in a pail all by their smelly selves, and then
dump them in the washer on a heavy-duty hot cycle with Tide.
Voila, fresh, stain-free diapers.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, in other laundry news, most stains ever encountered
by man or baby can be removed with an overnight soak in a wash basin with
hot water and some Oxy-Clean.  I just used it to get some thirty-year-old
stains out of a hand-me-down blanket from when Blake was a baby.
It's freaky-good.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Sleeping</h4>
<p>
If you're nursing, the best advice I can give you is to sleep
with your baby.  I've slept with both of mine and I had to nod
politely through all those conversations with other mothers about
being so sleep-deprived, because I'm just not.  Baby wakes up, you
offer the boob, baby nurses while you drift back to sleep.
And sleeping with your baby is just nice.  It's lovely to be
able to smell her soft round head in the middle of the night.
</p>
<p>
I don't know if I would try it if I were bottle-feeding, though,
because breast-feeding mothers actually sleep more lightly than
normal people, so you're less likely to squish your baby in the
night.  Also don't sleep with your baby if you smoke (!), or if
you've been drinking or taken medication which makes you sleepy
like Neo-Citran.  Also the baby should sleep next to you, not
between you and your husband, again because of the rolling-onto
issue.  We have a bed rail on my side of the bed but it's just a
technicality, because your baby will glom onto you like a remora.
It's astonishing how quickly a supposedly non-mobile baby will make
her way across a bed to the nearest warm body.
</p>
<p>
(Having said that, I still think the bed rail is a good idea.
And don't put the baby on the bed between you and a wall, there's just
too much scope for disaster there.)
</p>
<p>
You'll also want another one of those receiving blankets under
your baby and your boobs, to catch poop and spit-up and spilled
milk.  It's a lot easier to change a small blanket than your
entire bottom sheet.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Crying</h4>
<p>
Blake's advice for dealing with a crying baby is, do everything
you can think of.  Then do it again.  Eventually something will
work.  My advice is, do all the sensible things (feed, change, 
burp, rock, etc) and if nothing works, take off all her clothes.
Ostensibly you're looking for rashes or irritating tags on her
clothes or whatever, but I find babies just like being naked.
</p>
<p>
Remember crying peaks at six weeks, so this won't actually go on
forever.  And if you have done everything you can think of and
she's still crying (and you don't think she's sick), remember to
keep cuddling her.  Even if you can't make her stop crying at least
you can give her comfort.  (Unless you think you might throw
her out the window; in that case, put the baby down (somewhere
safe) and back away (maybe into the shower or something) -- give
yourself a time-out.)
</p>
<p>
Another thing you might do, although I don't remember doing this
with Delphine, is go out for a walk.  Fresh air usually settles
babies down and if she's tired the stroller will help her sleep.
Our midwife told us about a 24-hour drugstore where there are
often groggy parents doing midnight laps with their babies in
strollers.
</p>
<p>
One thing that helped me when I felt like a lousy parent because
I couldn't stop Delphine from crying was to think about people with
sick babies.  Blake was really sickly when he was a kid and he must
have spent HOURS of his life crying, and it doesn't seem to have
done him any harm.  I have a friend whose baby had open-heart
surgery at six months -- he must have cried so much, and there was
nothing his parents could do, but he is a perfectly normal and
happy kid now.  So don't put too much stock in the crying -- it's
upsetting to you, the parent, because it's meant to be, but it
doesn't always mean something is horribly wrong that you can
fix.

<strong>
<em>Who Runs This Country, Anyway? A Guide to Canadian Government</em>
    by Joanne Stanbridge</strong> is a kids' book but since I knew
    nothing about the structure of our government I needed something
    with small words and lots of diagrams.  This served the purpose
    and now I know more stuff.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Fiddlers</em> by Ed McBain.</strong>  Ed McBain is dead.  This makes me
sad.  Ed McBain wrote lots and lots of books, and I have only begun
to scratch the surface of them.  This makes me feel a little better.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>In Her Shoes</em> by Jennifer Weiner
</strong> is pretty good fluff.  Yeah, they made that movie about it.
I'm sure the book is better -- it's pretty thick and I'm sure they
had to cut a lot of it out to make a movie.  I won't be renting the
movie to find out though.  (It wasn't THAT good.)  The characterization
is a little suspect, though; people change but the author isn't
really convincing as to why they change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Collapse: How Societies Choose to Succeed or Fail</em> 
    by Jared Diamond
    </strong> took me forever to read, not because it's badly
    written but because it's long and Diamond is teeth-achingly
    thorough.  He examines at least eight societies in minute detail
    in order to make himself clear.  It's more like taking a course
    than reading a book.  By the end you're well and truly convinced,
    though.
    </p>
<p>
    It was an interesting read in light of the other book I read about
    how it's all going to hell, <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/books/_2005/november11.html"><em>The Long Emergency</em></a>; Diamond isn't as
    pessimistic but it's clear that he's thinking something big is
    going to happen within our lifetimes or those of our children
    (although probably not his since I think he's in his seventies.
    The man is awesome!  So smart and sprightly and he has that dapper
    Abe Lincoln beard-but-no-moustache thing going on.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Ingrid and the Wolf</em> by AndrÃ© Alexis
</strong> is a book for young adults which I would have loved when
I was younger.  I still quite like it now.  It was too short, though --
I would have wished it had gone on for much longer.  As an adult I
see that it is a good length for the story, though.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Who's Afraid of a Large Black Man</em> by Charles Barkley
</strong>.  Not much to say -- this didn't suck.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Your Two-Year-Old: Terrible or Tender</em> by Louise Bates Ames
</strong>.  You know how everyone says "my kid didn't come with a user's
manual!"  Well, here it is.  This is just a discussion of what kids
are like, and it's one of a series covering different ages.  There
isn't much specific advice, but what there is is delightfully non-judgemental
and pragmatic.  I'm reading the one about three-year-olds, and their
recommendation for dealing with three-and-a-half-year-olds?  Put
them in daycare, because they're at an age where they want to evoke
an emotional reaction in their mother, so they act up.  With a daycare
provider, no emotional reaction, no acting up, everyone is much 
happier.  Failing that, they say, get a babysitter.  Awesome!
</p>
<p>
They also give some advice which set my mind at ease: they give you
a bunch of "techniques" (ie, tricks) for dealing with your toddler
and getting things done, like saying "Let's put away your toys" instead
of telling the kid to do it and then getting into a huge battle of wills
ending with the inevitable timeout.  If you say "Let's..." then you can
just go ahead and do it without your kid's help, and no-one has lost face.
I had been thinking that I can't do stuff like that because I Have To
Show Her Who Is Boss -- Ames says it's more important just to get through
the day without a thousand battles than to make every interaction about
who is boss.  So, very useful books.

I have this friend who just had a baby, and I am about busting
with advice that she does not want.  But!  There is so much I
have learned about babies!  I want to share!
</p>
<p>
So I will non-agressively put what I have learned here so she
can take my advice or not without giving offence, and also so it's available for
anyone else who wants it.
</p>
<p>
Of course I don't suggest that all of this advice will work
for everyone, but some of it will work for someone, and I
think the more we all talk about how we handle this parenting 
thing the better off we will be.  (To that end you should go
read <a href="http://smartypants.diaryland.com/">Mimi
Smartypants</a> and <a href="http://www.dooce.com/">Dooce</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Your baby is going sleep most of the time, but after she's a
couple of weeks old she'll be awake sometimes too.  Most of the time
you'll be feeding her and changing her diaper, but sometimes 
you're going to want to put her down.  Get a <strong>high
chair</strong>.  One that reclines a lot so you can put a 
newborn in it.  We have an Evenflo Simplicity Easy-fold which 
I am very happy with.  Cordelia sits in it and hangs out while
I'm cooking or typing or whatever.  Also it has wheels on it
so I can wheel her around the condo with me.  (You're not
supposed to wheel it around with the baby in it, but whatever.)
And I tip it all the way back and put a blanket on her and
a soother in her mouth, and bang, she's asleep.  (I think
the way the chair surrounds her is more comforting than lying
flat on her back in the crib -- she's only four months out of the
womb, after all.)  It's her one-stop captain's chair.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly I haven't heard this advice anywhere else -- where
do other people put their babies when they're awake?  Alone in
their crib?  In a bouncy chair so all they can see is knees?
Flat on their back in a playpen to look at the ceiling?  I don't
know.
</p>
<p>
Okay, that's all for now because Cordelia is howling (in her
high chair -- it doesn't work miracles!).

No particular reason for that title, I just always wanted to use
it, and it is generally true.  In fact, I could pretty much use
it as the title of my entire journal.
</p>
<p>
First some shout outs (shouts out?) to my crippled friends.
On the other side of the pond is my friend Frances, who I
knew when I was in the equivalent of grade seven and eight,
and who I have by some miracle managed to keep in touch with
ever since, off and on.  We barely know each other, really,
but we persist in keeping in touch because we're stubborn
like that.  And as it turns out she likes Minette Walters
too, so she must be at least as cool as she was back in 
1907 or whenever.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, she is laid up with a broken leg which she suffered
in a bar fight at the hands of two unnamed female assailants while nobly
protecting a friend.  Fortunately Frances is a kickboxer
so if she has a broken leg I shudder to think what shape
the others were in.  
</p>
<p>
A little closer to home, my friend Kathryn (Delphine's
"beatifuw Kafryn") also broke her ankle over Christmas.
Sadly she doesn't have a good story like Frances, but she
does have an assortment of plates and pins in her leg which
necessitate her carrying a card at all times stating that
she is not a terrorist.  I think that's pretty cool.  
</p>
<p>
Kathryn is one of those people who seems to be blessed with
longer days than the rest of us, because she crams in so
much.  Besides being a teacher she also is in at least two
bands (she plays flute and piccolo) and my choir.  She plays
volleyball and just the other day I suggested we go skating
together sometime (after she's better, of course) and she
casually mentioned that yeah, she's a certified CanSkate
instructor.  All this and she's pretty too.  She
has a <a href="http://inquisiturient.blogspot.com/">new
blog</a> so all y'all can read about her interesting 
and busy life.  (No pressure, Kathryn.)
</p>
<p>
Cordelia just woke up so that will have to be all for now.
I'm off for a cuppa tea.
