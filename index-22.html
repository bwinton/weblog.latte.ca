                    <p>
Here I am in the most curious of situations; I have a
generally clean house and two sleeping girls.  I have
time on my hands.  I should spend it reading, because
I have books which a due back on Friday and which I
won't be able to renew because other people want them,
but on the other hand I should post here, because
clearly I have been neglecting this space.
</p>
<p>
About that...  a long, long time ago, I posted a big
whine about how I never do the things I want to do 
because I spend too much time watching television.  
Well, I am finally doing something about that.  Last
night I sat down and wrote down all the shows I 
<em>want</em> to watch (as distinguished from the shows
I watch because I am parked in front of the tv when
they are on) and what time they are on, and I don't
intend to switch on the television except at those
times.  (Unless I am checking the weather on channel
24.)
</p>
<p>
That should free up lots of time for reading, which
is good because I have forty books on hold at the
library.  And for posting here, which is good because
I miss it, and for reading my favourite discussion
board, which is really good because I really miss it.
</p>
<p>
Television isn't the only thing I am writing down;
I also started making four-week meal plans -- I 
come up with list of dinners, make a grand shopping
list and get Grocery Gateway to bring me everything
I will need.  Perishables I buy a week in advance.
It's awesome knowing what I am going to make for
dinner every day, and it's nice not to have to do
a big grocery shop every weekend.  Also it lets
me balance and control the amount of, say, beef
versus vegetarian meals we eat.
</p>
<p>
I'm also doing <a href="http://www.fitday.com">Fitday</a>
again, just to see whether I'm eating the right
amounts of things.  
</p>
<p>
Generally I seem to be seeking control over as
many aspects of my life as possible.  I don't
know why, quite, but I expect it has something
to do with the uncontrollability of babies and 
small children.  And more directly, I was getting
sick of my groundless feelings of helplessness
regarding, on the one hand, my failure to read
enough and on the other my failure to eat properly
and take care of myself.  Sitting around moaning
about your problems doesn't make them go away,
writing stuff down and getting on with it does.
At least if you're me.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, I feel (a little)
bad writing this much stuff
about myself; I feel like everyone comes here to
read about my children, not me.  Which is pretty
amusing considering I had an online journal long
before I had any children.
</p>
<p>
But more about me... we just got back from a
week in Saskatchewan visiting my parents.  It
was a nice time; we flew our kite, Delphine and
I went out in a boat, we ate lots of birthday
cake (Delphine turned three and my Dad turned
eighty-five while we were there), met new people.
My parents had a nice time with Delphine; my
mother was particularly amused by her constant
"Why"s.  We had fun coming up with good answers.
</p>
<p>
Now we're back home and everything is getting
back to normal.   These days, normal means
Delphine goes to daycare two or three days a
week, for the whole day.  She still enjoys it,
although she's been crying when we drop her off
since we got home from Sask.  I expect that will
pass soon.  The days she is in daycare, Cordelia
and I go for a long walk.  I do housework, I
amuse Cordelia, I cook and bake, I read.  
</p>
<p>
When Delphine
is home we generally don't stray far from home --
we might go to the park or to the convenience
store.  I do more housework but less baking, and
we read books, or do puzzles or play with 
playdough.  I don't get to read when Delphine 
is home because she bothers me to read to her
or play with her, except on the odd occasion
when both girls sleep at the same time.  Delphine
doesn't usually take a nap at home, although
I suspect she probably should.  (She usually
sleeps at daycare, they say.)
</p>
<p>
The girls have dinner at five and bedtime starts
at five-thirty.  If I am lucky everyone is in
bed by six-thirty, although it's more usually
around seven, and then Blake and I cook dinner
together.  We eat, we watch TV, we sleep, we
do it all again the next day.
</p>
<p>
On the weekends I get up when the girls do (six), 
and I let Blake sleep until seven-thirty or
eight.  Delphine and I make pancakes and eggs
one morning; the other morning we just have
cereal, and then after Blake wakes up we go
to the patisserie to get croissants and stuff
and the deli to get meat and cheese for 
brunch.  We go up to Eglinton to do errands 
(Shopper's, Dominion, bulk food, Future Shop),
grab a coffee on the way home.  That's our
weekend.  We're very domestic.
</p>
<p>
It's starting to feel a little crowded in our
condo -- Delphine is now sleeping in her bed
in our room, so that Cordelia can get used
to sleeping on her own before we move the two
of them together.  There really isn't room in
our bedroom for Delphine's bed, so I'm constantly
shimmying sideways to get past things.  
The toys are starting to take over the living
room, particularly the big things which can't
be hidden in boxes.  We have wagons and bikes
and strollers tucked away in every nook and
cranny.  And the kitchen is getting too small
-- there are multiple small appliances I am 
waiting on getting until we have a bigger
kitchen, not to mention the frustration of
only having space for one kind of rice.
(Chinese food with basmati is just weird;
ditto sticky rice with curry.)
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, we will have to put up with it
until next spring.  The plan, then, is that
I will get a part-time job which will bring 
in some extra cash, and we can then make an
informed decision about how much we can 
afford to pay for a house.  I have
a horrible fear that in the meantime our
neighbourhood will become massively trendy
and we won't be able to afford to stay here,
but I am willing to put up with a pretty crappy
house in order to stay close by, so I guess
it will work out in the end.
</p>
<p>
That's enough blather.  Cordelia is awake and
any moment now she will get tired of chewing on
my toes and go for the computer cables instead.

Delphine just turned three.  We went out to visit my parents
in Saskatchewan for her birthday, and they furnished a suitable
amount of cake, candles, fancy decorations and presents to
satisfy her little self.  We had a nice time.
</p>
<p>
We went to the doctor this morning for Delphine's three year
checkup.  She was a little nervous, but it turned out she
didn't get any shots, so that wasn't so bad.  She lay down
on the examination table properly, opened her mouth nice 
and wide,
and let the doctor check out all her vitals.  Generally she
is doing fine, although a little small for her age -- 
around the 40th percentile for height and a little lower 
for weight.  We're not concerned about it because she 
eats well, but we'll do the measurements again at 
3 and a half, just in case there is something up so 
we can catch it early.
</p>
<p>
And Cordelia is awake.  Thus ends the blogging for this
month...

...now with short reviews.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Accomodating Brocolli in the Cemetary or Why Can't Anybody Spell?</em>
    by Vivian Cook.  Fun, more list-y than I expected.  Good for reading on
    the crapper.</li>
<li>
<em>Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores The Hidden Side of 
    Everything</em> by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner.
    Thought-provoking, stats-based perspectives on just about everything.</li>
<li>
<em>One Summer's Grace: A Family Voyage Around Britain</em> by Libby Purves.
    I love Libby Purves.  I wish she lived next door to me and could come by
    for tea.</li>
<li>
<em>The Well-Ordered Home: Organizing Techniques for Inviting Serenity Into
    Your Life</em> by Kathleen Kendall-Tacket.  Apparently I already have
    a well-ordered home, because I didn't find anything particularly new
    in this book.  That is as I expected, and 
    not to say that wouldn't be useful to you, if you do not find your 
    home to be well-ordered.  (I only took it out because it's by one
    of the authors of the nursing book I just read, and I was curious.)</li>
<li>
<em>The Devil's Feather</em> by Minette Walters.  Minette Walters
    is always great, and this one was better than usual because she
    didn't spend so much time being bitter and miserable about the
    English.  This book ate an entire day of my life, which is pretty
    clever considering I am supposed to spend my days looking after 
    my children, not reading thrillers.</li>
<li>
<strike><em>The World is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century</em> by
    Thomas L. Friedman</strike>. I didn't finish this before it came due at the
    library; what I did get through wasn't anything 
    new to me, since it was mostly about
    the Internet revolution, and I was there studying or working in software
    when Netscape came out and when the web got big and Y2K and so on.  Towards
    the end of the book I think he gets into the social implications of the
    world being flat (ie, geography no longer being a limiting factor in
    the economy) but I didn't get to that part.  I wasn't sorry -- this was
    one of those books I read because I felt I ought to, not because I
    was really interested.</li>
<li>
<em>Willow and Twig</em> by Jean Little.  Loved this.</li>
<li>
<em>You Don't Have To Be Thin To Win: The Official Chub Club Coach's
    Workout Program</em> by Judy Molnar. Inspiring, if a little impractical --
    I am not about to train for a triathlon, or even a marathon; who has
    hours every day to work out?  (Having said that, I did put 
    Cordelia in the big stroller and go for an hour-long brisk
    walk today.  Like I said, inspiring.)</li>
<li>
<em>Goblin Market</em> by Christina Rosetti.  Why have I never
    come across this before?  Creepy and good -- I would love to see
    <a href="http://leontinemay.blogspot.com/">Leontine</a> illustrate
    this.</li>
<li>
<em>Goodnight Nobody</em> by Jennifer Weiner.  I wasn't sure about
    this at first because the protagonist doesn't really seem to like
    her children very much, but as it turns out she was just having one
    of those days, and also her husband was an asshole.  I can't imagine
    dealing with kids without a good, helpful, <em>present</em> husband
    at my side.  I think I would rather be not married at all than
    married to someone who was never home and not helpful when he was.
    But I digress.  (You have to read that in a South African accent,
    because I always say it with one in my head.  I'm not sure why.)
    Very fun book; I am happy Jennifer Weiner has written two more books
    I haven't read yet.</li>

                    <p>
<strong>1. Square Meatballs.</strong>
</p>
<p>
I got this from <em>Better Baby Food</em>, which is my favourite cookbook
these days.  In the book it's a recipe but here I will just describe
the idea: square meatballs.  Instead of making little round meatballs,
which involves lots of time spent with your hands coated in raw meat
(not so good when the baby gets into the Choking Hazards), you pat
your meatball mixture in a thin layer (three-quarters of an inch?)
in a baking dish, and then bake them for twenty minutes at 350F.  Yes,
it's basically a thin meatloaf.  
</p>
<p>
After they are done, use a sharp knife to cut them into little squares
for the kids and bigger squares for the grown-ups.  Genius!
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. Thing</strong>
</p>
<p>
My in-laws make a dish called Zucchini Thing, which is really so
unlike anything else that the only possible name 
for it is Thing.  I have the recipe, but I am loathe to make anything
that calls for Bisquick.  To my delight, though, I found a recipe in
a magazine for the very same thing, except without Bisquick:
</p>
<p>
3 C grated zucchini<br>
1 small onion, chopped<br>
1 C all-purpose flour<br>
1 C grated provolone cheese<br>
3 eggs, beaten<br>
1/4 C vegetable oil<br>
4 T grated Parmesan<br>
2 t chopped fresh basil<br>
1 t baking powder<br>
1 t salt<br>
1/2 t black pepper
</p>
<p>
Mix it all together, slap it in a greased pie plate, cook it at 350F 
for 45 to 50 minutes or until golden brown, let it cool for 10 minutes,
and <em>voila</em>!  Thing!
</p>
<p>
The nice thing about Thing, though, is that it is forgiving.  Substitute
some other pureed vegetable for the zucchini (provided it is about as
moist as grated zucchini, which is pretty moist).  Stick some other
kind of cheese in!  And best of all, kids love it and it has three (3)
food groups.  Cut it into little squares and let 'em pick it up in
their fingers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. Chocolate charoset</strong>
</p>
<p>
I just made this up today.  I was making charoset for Passover dinner
tonight (I know, we're late) and I did it Sephardic style, in little
balls rolled in cinnamon.  After I had done a few I thought they looked
like truffles, and my mind wandered to truffles coated in cocoa.  "Hm."
I thought.  "I wonder..."  So I tried it, and they're really tasty.
Dessert charoset!

<p>
Inspired variously by the fact that Cordelia isn't growing
as fast as she should, the knowledge that she isn't getting
nearly as much sleep as she needs, and 
<a href="http://www.dooce.com/archives/daily/03_31_2006.html">Dooce's 
post on the topic</a>, 
Blake and I decided to gird our loins and start putting 
Cordelia to sleep in her crib, alone, at appropriate times.
</p>
<p>
We, too, are using <em>Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child</em>
by Dr. Mark Weissbluth; it was what got us through teaching
Delphine to sleep.
The idea is to put Cordelia to sleep, after a nice little
routine, at a good early hour.  Then we just walk away and
let her work it out by herself.  Also, we're supposed to put
her down to sleep in her crib for two naps a day, when she
seems tired.
</p>
<p>
(Incidentally, don't take this as advice, because it probably
won't apply to your child at whatever age she is now.  If
you want advice you should really go read the book, because
I am far from qualified to give advice on this topic.)
</p>
<p>
Last night was the first night. Cordelia didn't have a nap
in the afternoon because she is so abysmal at getting to
sleep; the more tired she gets the more worked up she gets,
and she won't be soothed unless I catch her by surprise
with a nursing.  So after unsuccessfully trying, from two 
in the afternoon until five, to get her to sleep, I decided
I would take advantage of her sleep-deprived state and my
own determination born of frustration, and get on with 
teaching her to sleep in the crib.
</p>
<p>
I changed her into her pyjamas and then nursed her, at which
of course she fell asleep, so I carried her into the bedroom
and put her in the crib.  She immediately detected the fine
layer of hot pins we keep always at the ready in the crib, and
started screaming.  I tried to soothe her by rubbing her 
back, patting her bum, giving her a soother, but she was having
none of it.  Finally I just left her and closed the door
(after the cats decided they didn't want to stay in the 
bedroom listening to that racket, thanks).  She cried from
6:20 until around 7:10, and then again from eight until, 
I don't know, 8:30?  I wasn't really paying attention.
(New <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>.)
</p>
<p>
At that point (well, during an ad break) I broke down crying 
at the idea of leaving her
in the crib overnight; I am not ready to give up (for life!)
the delicious solid warmth of a baby at my side in bed.  
Blake figures that Cordelia is smart enough to deal with
sleeping in the crib from 6:00 until 10:30 and then coming
into bed with us.  (I'm still not sure if it will work but
I really want to try it. I want to have it both ways -- a baby
with a proper bedtime and a baby who co-sleeps.)
</p>
<p>
She started crying again after ten, and since we were going
to bed anyway Blake went and picked her up, and once I was
ready for bed tucked her in with me.
</p>
<p>
Today we screwed up the naps royally; she was tired at
9:00 am, as she should be, but we were in the middle of
bathing Delphine and getting ready to go out for croissants.
We weren't quite ready enough to put her in the stroller
to sleep (she sleeps really well in the stroller, even
if it's just sitting in the living room),
but if we put her in the crib and waited for her to finish
her nap we would have been too late.  So Blake held her,
and she fought sleep for half-an-hour.  She slept on his shoulder
for a few minutes, maybe twenty, then woke up and didn't
fall asleep again.
</p>
<p>
For the afternoon nap, she normally gets tired at 2:00,
but today we all went out to get cat litter and milk at
around 1:00, and she fell asleep in the stroller.  We
were only gone around a half an hour, and she woke up soon
after we got home.  (Naps are supposed to be in the crib,
and at least an hour, according to Weissbluth.)
</p>
<p>
So tonight, again, she was good and tired.  I changed her
into her jammies at around 5:45, gave her a little nurse
(she didn't fall asleep this time) and put her down at
6:00.  Again she screamed frantically, but at 6:09... silence.
Nine minutes!  She awoke at 7:50 but didn't cry for more
than a couple of minutes.  It's almost too easy.
</p>
<p>
I remember this from Delphine, the
weird feeling of emptiness that you get when neither of 
you is holding baby.  You can read, because you don't have
to keep the lights down!  You can play on the computer!  You
can cook!  It's like... why, it's like having no children at
all!  Bedtime is awesome.
</p>
<p>
I have some friends with children Delphine's age whose kids
stay up until their parents go to bed, and I think they 
are INSANE.  
I would easily trade a few nights of screaming, for whole 
evenings of adult time.  Not to mention how badly you are 
screwing you
kid over by depriving them of the hours and hours of sleep
they need, that you don't.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, lest you think I am a completely callous bitch,
I hate the screaming.  It sucks, and like I said
to Blake, I wish I could somehow be with Cordelia to comfort
her, and simultaneously not be with her so she can learn how
to sleep by herself.  But the dangers of leaving your baby
to cry it out are hypothetical, while the dangers of sleep
deprivation are well documented, and this is the best way
of getting my children to get the amount of sleep they need
-- possibly the only way.
Weissbluth actually has a whole section about why he thinks
it's okay to let your baby cry it out, which I found quite
convincing, if hard to remember when the actual crying is
taking place and your blood pressure's up and your boobies
are leaking all over the place.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, so far so good.  As you can see, when we did this
with Delphine Blake actually thought it would be such
a big deal that it would need a whole 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/delphine/sleeping">category</a>
to itself.  You will also see that the category has only
one post; it really turned out to be a non-event, and
she has been a fantastic sleeper ever since.  Here's
hoping the same is true of Cordelia.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
Oh, I'm sure Baba would like me to mention that Cordelia said
her first word: "Baba".  I think Russian grandmothers are
the smartest grandmothers, picking baby's very first consonant
to form their name.

We took Cordelia for her six month checkup.  She had two
shots (Pentacel and Prevnar, I think; I wrote it down) and
was weighed and measured.  She's 17 lbs and one ounce,
27 inches long and has a head circumference of around 17
inches.  Her growth curve is levelling out a little too rapidly
for our doctor's  liking; the same thing happened with 
Delphine, and it only resolved itself when we started
enforcing a proper sleep schedule.  Cordelia's sleep
is appalling and we are going to have to fix it, but
I don't want to think about it.  There will be crying.
</p>
<p>
She still smiles a lot, and has taken to laughing.  You
can make her laugh by tickling her, but she also laughs
if you laugh, or if you make a silly face, or if you
put her on your head like a hat.    And she makes me
laugh, with her silly gummy smile and her noisy babbling.
</p>
<p>
She says "Ba ba bah", and pushes up onto her hands and
knees, and can sit up by herself, although I still like
to lurk nearby when she's sitting
because she's not adept enough to fall over
gracefully, and inevitably smucks her head on the floor.
She's pretty mobile, in a limited kind of way -- she
gets around on her belly, and I'm never sure how much
of the getting around is deliberate and how much is
just incidental to her flailing.

Jeez, I just typed out the names of the books I read since my 
last post, and it's clear I read too damn much.  Honestly, I don't
know where I find the time, so don't ask me.
</p>
<p>
(I remember when I was a kid I would say -- well, brag about, really --
how many books I read, and the mothers would look at each other and
roll their eyes and say "Well, I guess you have a lot of time!"  Hah!
Take this, snarky mothers!)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I have time to read them but not blog about them, so this
is going to be short.  Ish.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Akimbo and the Elephants</em> by Alexander McCall Smith</strong>
is also short, a little wee thing which I think took the author as long
to write as it took me to read.  It had a hurried feel, the characters
were thin, it was all a little obvious.  As if some elephant charity had
called the author and said "Write a nice little book about elephants!"
and he knocked it off in an afternoon.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>I Gave My Mom A Castle</em> by Jean Little</strong> is a 
wonderful collection of poems about families and gifts.  Little has
a knack for capturing children's thoughts and voices.  I remember 
enjoying her stuff when I was younger; perhaps now is a good time
to revisit it.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>PÃ¨re Goriot</em> by HonorÃ© de Balzac</strong>
is one of my New Year's Resolution books, because it has a character
named Delphine in it.  It might even be the character that my Aunt
Delphine is named after, although naming your kid after this
Delphine seems like asking for trouble.  Anyway, Balzac is one
pessimistic bastard and almost everyone in this book is scheming
and dishonest, and those that aren't mostly get screwed in the end.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Breastfeeding Made Simple: Seven Natural Laws for
Nursing Mothers</em> by Nancy Mohnbacher and Kathleen 
Kendall-Tackett</strong> is an excellent book on nursing.  I got
it out so I could look it over and decide whether to recommend
it to a friend, but I ended up learning a bunch of stuff myself.  It
approaches nursing from the perspective of what's going on and
how you can make the natural process work for you, like growing
a seed, rather than giving a series of steps on How To Nurse, like
building an Ikea bookshelf.
</p>
<p>
I think this book should be recommended reading for every expectant
or nursing mother.
</p>
<p>
It also has a <a href="http://www.breastfeedingmadesimple.com/">fairly
tacky website</a> which might have some useful stuff in it.  Check
out that title!  Now that's professional!  (Ah yes: 
"&lt;meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 4.0"&gt;"
Always a good way to make a crappy impression.)
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Culture of Fear: Why Americans Are Afraid Of
The Wrong Things</em> by Barry Glassner</strong> is a nice,
reassuring book, in the sense that you don't really have to
be afraid of all the things the media would like you to be 
afraid of, but very unreassuring in that it give you 
the sense that people are very
stupid and can't seem to think for themselves.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Sir Charles: Wit and Wisdom of Charles Barkley</em> 
by Charles Barkley and Rick Reilly</strong>; Charles Barkley is
a pretty funny guy, in that he says stuff that everyone else is
scared to and he's usually right.  What I would give for this kind
of self-assurance.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Don't Get Too Comfortable</em> by David Rakoff</strong>.
Apparently if you are a good enough writer you can get someone
to pay you to do crazy stuff like visit a cryogenics lab, or fly 
the Concorde, or interview some dude at the Log Cabin Republicans,
just so you can write about it.  That's what this book is, and 
it's pretty funny and well-written and occasionally thought-provoking.
(I liked the part about the faux-poverty.)
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Understand Your Child's Growing Mind</em> by Christine 
Healy</strong> is another interesting, science-based book about
a parenting topic.  It's pretty dense, covering lots of ground
with respect to mental development, but readable.
I would recommend this to
anyone concerned with their child's intellect.  
</p>
<p>
The book has lots of 
neatly sidebarred tips on how to help prepare your child's mind
for reading, mathematics, etc.  Unfortunately if you added up
all the sidebars you would end up with about eight hundred
bulleted items, and if you tried to follow them you would never 
have time to brush your own teeth, you would be so busy massaging 
your kid's brain.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Dress Your Best</em> by Clinton Kelly and Stacy London</strong>
is basically <em>What Not To Wear</em> in book form.  It's divided
up by body type with tips for each type, but there are general tips
for everyone scattered throughout the book, so you have to read the
whole thing to get maximum utility out of it.  I managed to glean a
full page of tips from it, but sadly there was no five thousand dollar
credit card in the book, nor anyone to babysit for a week while I 
shop.  I guess looking fabulous is going to have to wait.
