Now that both England and Brazil are out of the World Cup
finals I'm having a hard time getting excited about the
last few games.  At least Italy are in; they are always
a useful second backup after Brazil, but while I am glad
to see them play, I don't really care all that much whether
they win or lose.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's hard watching football around here.  Watching a 
football match properly calls for a degree of attention
that is impossible while you are making sure that Child 2
isn't choking on some abandoned crayon, and at the same
time reading Pooh (with all the right voices) to Child 1.
So mostly it's been on as background noise for the last 
month, a screen saver for the television.  It's the most
TV Delphine has ever watched, I think.  We talk
about where the players come from, and what their names
are.  (Delphine now knows that Germany is a country.)
</p>
<p>
I will be sorry when it's all over; I have tried being
interested in league football, but I just don't care,
and even the Euro Cup (or whatever it's called) isn't
all that interesting.  You have to have the little 
African countries to root for, and the wonderful 
South Americans.  So I'll put my fan hat away until 
2010, when Delphine will be seven and Cordelia
will be three and a half -- older than Delphine is
now.  (Last World Cup we had no children at all!)  And
maybe next time England will win...

I realized today why my injured knee has been bothering me
so much, emotionally.
It's because that horrible little man, that man who lives
in the back of my head and who I thought I had banished
forever, is dancing with glee.  He is dancing with glee
and hissing "You see?  I told you!  I told you you are too
fat to be a runner!'
</p>
<p>
Shut up, nasty little man, and crawl back in your hole,
because my knee feels better today and I will run again.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
Okay, you know the other thing that pisses me off
about this?  (Soon I will stop going on about this,
I promise.)  Blake decided that he was going to
ride his bike up to Balm Beach, like, 135 kilometers, 
and you know what,
I bet he is going to do it.  But <em>I</em> decide 
I am going to start running
and not two weeks into it I am couch-bound with a stupid
injury!  This after I had to give up hot yoga 
because of my back!  It's like every time I try and
get fitter something fouls it up.
</p>
<p>
How come everyone else can do this stuff and I can't?
Waah!
</p>
<p>
I know, welcome to my pity party.  I hope that eventually
this will just be a humourous anecdote about the 
inauspicious start to my long running career.  There I will
be, cocktail in hand: "I had only been running for
a week -- I had been out three times! -- and there
I was with an injured knee!  Ha ha!  Can you believe
it!  Well, then I got proper shoes and 
here I am, three marathons later!  Incredible!  
Ha ha ha!  Pass the olives!"

We went to the doctor yesterday for Cordelia's nine month
checkup.  Here are her specs:
</p>
<p>
Weight: 20 lbs<br>
Height: 29.3 inches<br>
Head Circumference: 18 inches
</p>
<p>
No shots this time, and I couldn't think of anything to say
to the doctor.  She has reached all the appropriate milestones

A couple of weeks ago, after I read that Silken Laumann book,
I realized that I no longer had any excuse not to take a
running clinic at The Running Room.  
I had thought for a while about taking a clinic, thought about it, 
planned to do it at some unspecified point in the future...
and suddenly I realized that that point was now.
Cordelia is old enough
that she can be away from me for a while, and Blake is
more than willing to look after her and Delphine
while I go out running.
</p>
<p>
So I signed up for the Learn To Run clinic, a ten-week
program that promises to take the slobbiest
slob and render them capable of running a 5K.
I dug out
my old running shoes and showed up 
the first Saturday, 8:30 in the morning.  
I was full of energy, keen
to go, had been up for hours already!  I ran, I walked,
it was great, it was easier than I thought, I loved
being out in the fresh air first thing in the morning
before all the crowds.  I went for a practice run 
that Monday,
and then for a bike ride with Blake on Thursday.  
I was feeling 
good, healthy, my back was feeling looser and
less painful than it had in years.
</p>
<p>
Okay, my knee was a little sore on the bike ride,
but hey!  My knees are always a little sore!
Arthritis, right?  Getting some exercise and losing
weight will only help, right?  So I went to the clinic
and ran again -- it was still good, but a little harder
this week.  Oh, and they mentioned that you should 
really get new shoes after you have babies because
your feet change.  Oh.
</p>
<p>
By then my knee really hurt, but I walked
the twenty-minute walk home, then back up to the
store again later that day to buy new shoes, and
home again.  (I am really stupid.)
</p>
<p>
My knee still hurt by Wednesday -- all the time,
whether I was walking or running or just sitting -- 
so I went to see my physical therapist.  And as
it turns out, I have injured the cartilage in my
knee and I won't be able to run for at least a
couple of weeks, if ever.  (The "if ever" part
we will find out through a process of trial and
error, lucky me.)  
</p>
<p>
And in the meantime, I have to stay off my feet
as much as possible;
no trip to the store, no
trip to the library to pick up the books I have
on hold there.  It's a blessing that
Starbucks is just across the street, that's all
I say.  The irony is that I started this trying to
get fit, and here I am more sedentary than ever.
</p>
<p>
Oh woe, oh woe, but at least I am not dead.  
(A friend of a friend was killed in a horseback
riding accident last weekend, a timely reminder
that it could always be worse.)

    <p>
Cordelia is going to be nine months old next Tuesday.
She is strong and big, she is charming and funny.
She smiles at people; I will be walking along
with her in the stroller, and someone coming the
other way, someone frowning or lost in thought,
will suddenly start
to smile like they have seen a long-lost friend.
I will start to panic: do I know this person?  Should
I remember their name?  Then I realize they are
been sucked into the vortex of joy that is Cordelia's
smile; it's like they literally can't resist smiling
back.  I hope she always uses her powers for good,
not evil.
</p>
<p>
Just a couple of days ago she gave up the commando crawling
in favour of the traditional hands-and-knees method, which
seems more efficient and doesn't pick up so much dust. 
But crawling, for Cordelia, is just a method of getting
to something she can use to stand up.  She <em>loves</em>
to stand up, against the couch, against the table, 
even against the wall.  She loves the challenge of 
standing up against the glider ottoman, because it
moves; if you wiggle it back and forth when she's
leaning on it she laughs.  She likes to stand up and
hold on with one hand; she will turn and catch your
eye and grin: "look, mum!"  This morning I was holding
just one hand while she stood up, and I let go and she
stayed upright, although it was the momentary
uprightness of, say, a two-by-four balanced on its
end.  I caught her before she toppled, but while 
she stood there she was grinning like mad.  She is
fearless and a bit of a show-off.
</p>
<p>
She is eating almost everything except milk and 
the usual things which are verboten until one 
year (eggs, honey, berries).  She eats soft
table food, like cheese and toast with the crusts
cut off and banana, and would really prefer to 
feed herself than be spoon-fed, which means I have
to remember to prepare things which are tidy enough
to be finger food.  She's patient enough, though,
that I can give her a pile of rice on her tray
and she will pick it up, kernel by kernel, and 
stuff it slowly in.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, her pincer grasp is really good.  She
still has some trouble with losing bits of food
in her fist; if she has some toast or something
clutched in her hand she eats the parts that 
protrude from her grasp, but she doesn't know
yet that she has to open her fist to get at 
what's inside, so she tries to put her whole hand
in her mouth.  Cute; not too smart though.
</p>
<p>
She's sleeping fairly well (if you consider
going to bed at 6:30 and waking up at 5:00 
to be well).  She naps twice during the day,
alone in her crib just like a TV baby.
I think the early wake-up is because we put
her to bed so early, but I'm not sure how to
shift it later without ballsing up our whole
evening; after Cordelia goes to bed we put
Delphine to bed, which usually takes between
half-an-hour and forty-five minutes, and then
we make dinner.  That puts us making dinner
at seven and usually not eating until eight,
which is about as late as I can stand it.  If
we move the girls' bedtime later, I think we
would have to start having dinner with them,
but that would make either our dinner too early or
their bedtime too late, plus I don't relish
the idea of cooking a proper dinner whilst
supervising the girls.  (I usually cobble
together sometime fairly quick (but still
healthy!) for the girls and then make something
more elaborate for Blake and I.)
</p>
<p>
So, whatever, I guess we will just leave it
as it is for now and try and go to bed earlier
ourselves so as to deal better with the five 
o' clock reveille.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
I'm treating Cordelia completely differently
than I treated Delphine.  This morning after we
had breakfast I left her in the living room while
I did
something in the kitchen (there's a window
from the kitchen to the living room, so I wasn't
entirely out of sight) and she hung around doing
her thing; she stood up, she sat back down, she
pulled books off the shelves, she climbed in
amongst the toys and sat smugly in the midst of
all that plenty like a tiny rajah.  
</p>
<p>
I would never have done that with Delphine; the
moment I tried to put her down she would have
started crying and I would have picked her up
again.  She was on my hip constantly 
until she was about
fifteen months old.  
If she did play in the living room, 
I would have been hovering behind her,
spotting her as she stood up and holding my 
breath as she sat down.    
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure, and never will be, how much of
Cordelia's boldness and independence is because 
I'm not hovering over her, and how much I am 
able to not hover because she's so independent.
Similarly I will never know how much of Delphine's
clinginess as a baby was because I never let 
her experience what it was to be alone.  What I do 
know is that Delphine is independent and confident
now, so whatever insecurity she experienced about
being alone, she had the resources to deal with
it when the time came.  
</p>
<p>
I think the difference 
is that Delphine learned to be on her own at
twenty months, and Cordelia has learned to be on
her own at six months, and I expect that doesn't
amount to a hell of a lot of difference in the
long run.

<strong><em>In Your Face: The Culture of Beauty and You</em> 
by Shari Graydon</strong> is a beauty myth primer for teens,
and as such didn't really tell me anything I didn't already
know, although I think it did me good to be reminded of this
stuff.  I've been watching too much <em>What Not To Wear</em>
and am starting to think that it's good and right to want to
be pretty all the time.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Risk: A Practical Guide for Deciding What's Really 
Safe and What's Really Dangerous in the World Around You</em> by 
David Ropeik and George Gray</strong>.  This is really what
it claims to be: a practical guide.  It's a huge list of
everything you think is scary -- radiation, electromagnetic
waves, pesticide residue, tap water -- with discussions of
how scared you should actually be, and why, and what you
can do to protect yourself.  This would be a handy reference
book to keep around the house.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>An Intelligent Person's Guide to Judaism</em> by 
Shmuel Boteach</strong>.  (Actually now I'm not sure whether
I got the 1999 edition by "Shmuel" or the 2006 edition by
"Shmuley".  I wonder what else changed...)  I got this because
I am vaguely interested in Judaism and also because I love
Shmuley's show on TLC.  As it turns out, Judaism is pretty
cool but I can't get past the believing in God requirement.
I guess that's a pretty fundamental part of this whole
Abrahamic religion thing but I just can't do it.
</p>
<p>
Some other thoughts: Shmuley doesn't like Ashkenazi
culture.  What's wrong with knishes?  What's wrong with
klezmer?  Nothing, that's what!  
</p>
<p>
The part refuting the Christian idea of suffering
being a means to better oneself threw me for a loop
because I realized I have bought that concept entirely.
When someone claims that their suffering made them
stronger I nod agreeably; it had never even occurred
to me that it might not be so.  I'm still not sure
that it is always false; I think that some suffering
is good for you.  Where Shmuley and I may differ is
in the scale of the suffering under consideration;
he is talking about being, say, imprisoned and used
for creepy medical experimentation where I am thinking
more of, say, not having a TV in your bedroom.
</p>
<p>
The whole section about women was a little creepy.  I'm
just not sure where I stand on the whole gender thing
these days. Having read <em>Gender Wars</em> (and
having a working brain) I know
that women are not identical to men; being a feminist I
believe that women are legally, morally and in every
other way equal to men; being a mathematician I know
that the differences between men and women in most
meaningful scales are less significant than the 
variation within either group; being a parent I believe
that someone has to put the home and family first
and their career second.  Shmuley thinks that the
woman is most biologically suited to that role, but
I don't think that's so.  Shmuley also says women
are naturally more spiritual than men, gentler,
more compassionate, smell better -- a lot of nice
things which make me think maybe I am being 
patronized.  Maybe not, though, perhaps I am over-sensitive
and suspicious.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I will read some more Shmuley books and see
how they are.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Better House and Planet</em> by Marjorie
Harris</strong> is a book about how to keep your house 
in an environmentally sensitive manner.  It's actually
one of those "1000 Household Tips"-type books that 
were popular in the eighties.  I took it out because
I wanted some tips on cleaning without using nasty
cleaning products, but this book is more like a big
game of "Bullshit or not?!"  A sliced avocado won't brown
if you don't take the stone out: bullshit or not?  
Bullshit!  I can't remember any more, but this book
had a concentration of about one urban legend per
two pages.  
</p>
<p>
Very disappointing, and I still don't know
how to clean without using nasty products.  Maybe
I will just use vinegar for everything.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The World's Best Street &amp; Yard Games</em> by Glen 
Vecchione</strong> is a collection of all the cool games
you played (or didn't play, in my case) when you were a kid,
and lots more besides.  Games for when you are feeling rowdy
or when you are all dressed up and can't get dirty; games
for day and games for night; games for the sidewalk and
games for the park.  It's an excellent collection,
and it made me wish the girls would hurry up and grow up
so we could play.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Cross Bones</em> by Kathy Reichs</strong>.  Another
good Kathy Reichs, although again her sentence fragments —
and paragraphs consisting entirely of a single sentence
fragment — got on my nerves.  And this time her
"my subconscious is trying to tell me something"
shtick that she does at the end of every book she writes
annoyed me as well.  (Then Jeffrey Deaver did it in his
book too — do all mystery writers do it and I just
never noticed before?  Surely not.)
</p>
<p>
But what annoyed me most of all was how much they screwed 
up this character and the stories when they made the TV
series <em>Bones</em>.  It's like they threw out everything
that was good about the books, threw in David Boreanaz and
half-baked the whole thing.  Is that show even still on?
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Naked</em> by David Sedaris</strong> is very 
funny and good, although his constant moaning about what
a sad loser he is is a bit of a demotivator when after all,
he is the one who wrote the book and there you are sitting
at home reading it.  If he's a sad loser, what does that
make you?  I don't really know how he went from being a
sad loser to having his book on my shelf, but there you go.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, if you like this you might like the 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/books/_2006/mar31.html">David
Rakoff book I read a while ago</a>; they are both gay New 
Yorkers named David who do weird things and write about them
amusingly.  
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>When You Lunch With The Emperor</em> by Ludwig Bemelmans</strong>.
Anyone who has read to Delphine knows that Ludwig Bemelmans
is the <em>Madeline</em> guy, but apparently he also
wrote books for grown-ups.  This is a collection of his
autobiographical essays; witty, cutting but not catty,
poignant, favourable adjective, favourable adjective.  
I will read more of his stuff eventually; you should too.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Twelfth Card</em> by Jeffrey Deaver</strong>.
This is a Lincoln Rhyme book; if you remember the movie
<em>The Bone Collector</em>, it was an adaptation of an
earlier Lincoln Rhyme book starring Denzel Washington
as Lincoln Rhyme in an unusual spot of race-blind casting.
Unfortunately it caused me some mild confusion at the 
beginning of this book, because the Lincoln Rhyme in the
book is not only white but is required by the plot to be
somewhat ignorant of black culture.  Once I sorted out
the "he's actually white" thing I was fine.
</p>
<p>
The book was heavy on information, with lots of clunky sentences
like "Mel Cooper lifted several samples off the tape and ran
them through the gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, the 
workhorse instrument in all forensic labs.  It separates 
unknown trace into its component parts and then identifies them."
Smooth, but then I suppose you have to get that information
out somehow, and I would rather the author just blurt it 
out rather than giving it to a character as some crude
expository dialogue: "Mrs.
Jones, this is a gas chromatograph slash mass spectrometer.
Perhaps you already know that it is the workhorse..."
</p>
<p>
I supposed the "romance" between Sachs and Rhyme (or as
I think of them, Angelina and Denzel) is developed in
one of the earlier books, but in this book I just 
couldn't see the attraction; Rhyme seemed like a
patronizing ass, and Sachs seemed to be annoyed with
him much of the time.  As I would be.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, having said all that, still an enjoyable read
with a damn good mystery, some surprising twists and a 
satisfying result.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Get Your Tongue Out Of My Mouth, I'm Kissing You Goodbye</em> 
by Cynthia Heimel</strong>.  Despite the tacky title and 
the even tackier cover, this was a collection of good, funny
essays by an author I hadn't encountered before.  I
will see if she has written anything more recent though,
because this book was really dated: she makes references to Miatas
and <em>Ghost</em>, she claims New Yorkers don't eat sushi
and that you shouldn't wear high heels with jeans.  It
boggles the mind, really, but I suppose that's what
happens when you write a pop culture book.

<strong>Neutrogena Fresh Cooling Body Mist Sunblock, SPF 30</strong>:
This is the stuff that is advertised that you don't have to rub it in, 
you just spray it on.  I hate using sunblock because of the sticky
goo factor, so I thought I would try this.  It's an old-school metal
aerosol can, which I don't usually buy because they're so hideous
for the environment.  It does indeed spray in a very fine mist;
so fine that about sixty percent of it flies into the air and 
never actually makes it to your skin.  Instead it goes all over
your bathroom, or worse, into your lungs.  Well, into your
nose; hopefully it doesn't actually make it to your lungs.  
It's so bad that I banish the children from the bathroom
and put on the extractor fan before I use it.
It also gets caught in all the little 
hairs, so I wonder how much of it is really reaching my 
skin.  And to add injury to insult, it gave me a painful,
itchy, flaking rash on my neck and shoulders.  Boo.  I am
using it up on my feet and the tattoo on my ankle, and I will
never buy it or any other aerosol sunblock again.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, I do like gel-based sunblocks for me and Blake
and sunblock in stick form for the girls.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 55</strong>,
for daily use as a facial moisturizer/sunblock.  I
bought this because of a recommendation years ago from Katie
on The Suspects.  I had been using the Oil of Olay face
lotion with sunblock, but that left me really greasy and shiny,
so I'd have to use powder on top.  Katie said this stuff left
a really nice finish, so I gave it a try and I love it.  It
goes on quite thick but really does dry to a powdery finish;
it doesn't feel heavy at all.  It's not meant as a moisturizer
so I don't know how it would be for someone who needs a lot of
moisture on their face, but for me it's perfect.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Anita Nursing Bra Model 5058</strong>.  The previous
gold standard for nursing bras was the 
<a href="http://www.anita.com/de/en/148,1,104,1480,39183__products-detail.htm">Anita 
5062</a>; two
separate bra boutiques sold me that bra and it is a 
fantastic bra.  However, last time I went to my bra
shop they showed me the 
<a href="http://www.anita.com/de/en/148,1,104,1480,41666__products-detail.htm">new
5058</a> and it's even better; it has more cotton so it's
less stretchy and provides, as they put it, more "lift".
More lift means my boobs are up where they're supposed 
to be and my midsection appears mysteriously thinner.
It also has pretty pink ribbon, which is good for morale.
Hooray!
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, the bra boutique where I spend all Blake's
hard-earned money always does a proper sizing, of course.
Guess what size I am?  Go on, guess. You'll never guess.
38G.  Seriously.  Who the hell is a 38G?  That's just
silly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Colgate Luminous Toothpaste, Paradise Fresh flavour</strong>.  
I bought this because I had a coupon, and I liked the shiny
box.  At first I loved it; it's purple, it has little sparkles,
it comes out in a star-shape, it tastes faintly fruity.  It's
like toothpaste for a princess, apart from that you have to
squeeze it out yourself.  But
now I am annoyed because it's too foamy — it foams up
to, like, three times the volume of regular toothpaste within
about ten seconds, so you have to spit right away and start
over.  And the "clean cap" technology is a joke, in that way
of something advertised to have a particular characteristic
which then turns out to have quite the opposite characteristic.  
I have never had a toothpaste tube so encrusted with dried
toothpaste goo in my life.  I will not buy this pretty purple toothpaste again.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<a href="http://www.princelionheart.com/site/t_str_6550.html">Prince 
Lionheart Stroller Connectors</a></strong>.  This
is probably one of the worse baby-related purchases I have
made.  The theory is sound, but in reality the width of two
umbrella strollers plus the generous six inches of the
connectors is too wide to go through a standard door, so 
you can only use this on wide sidewalks or maybe in big
suburban malls, provided you're not going to actually go
into a store.  Also (and this is my own stupidity)
you're not suppsed to use the umbrella strollers for children
heavier than 30 lbs, and Delphine is only one pound shy of 
that now, so we won't be able to use this for long anyway.
Fortunately the connectors were only $20, so no great loss.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Chi-chi Foo Foo Manicure</strong>.  I bought my friend
Kathryn a manicure at a fancy upscale nail spa for her birthday,
and a couple of weeks ago we finally got around to going.
As a birthday present it worked out well; the experience
was fun and we got a chance to hang out.  As a manicure,
though, it was dismal.  I am quite capable of 
putting lotion on my own hands and filing my own nails;
the part I have trouble with is getting the nail polish
on really perfectly and having it stay on.  Sadly that
seemed to be the part these manicurists had trouble with
too: the polish job was shoddy and started chipping off
within a couple of days.  Also both Kathryn and I had
dirt under our nails (we both work with children!) and
they didn't clean them.  On the one hand it's kind of
creepy and gross to ask someone to clean your nails for
you, but on the other hand can you really call it a
successful manicure when your client walks away with dirty
nails?

Today Delphine is at daycare.  Blake is in Montreal on 
business so to lighten my load, my in-laws took 
Delphine for a sleep-over last night.  She was
really excited to go:  "Can I sleep in the crib?"
They have a Pack n' Play and Delphine still loves
to sleep in it even though she can't stretch out
in it any more.  This afternoon I will go and pick
her up from daycare at around 4:30; when I get there
Cordelia will be mobbed by all the little children
who are not lucky enough to have a baby sister, and
Delphine will play it cool, walking away from me
and finding something else to do.  After a few
minutes she will come back and show me what she
is doing, and then she will say "Wanna go home."
And we will walk around the corner and down the
block, stopping to examine an ant or some broken
glass, and to step up onto the entrance at Pizza
Pizza.
</p>
<p>
She's good company these days.  She is hardly
ever arbitrarily defiant any more; mostly she
is compliant and friendly, and if she isn't it's
because she's tired or hungry or she wants to
wrest your attention away from Cordelia.
</p>
<p>
I'm feeling a little sad lately because we
don't read as much as we used to, because of 
Cordelia.  I used to literally sit and read to
her for an hour or more, but Cordelia isn't 
old enough to sit and be read to yet, so she
comes and crawls all over us and pulls the book
away and is generally a nuisance.  I try and read
to Delphine while Cordelia is napping, but I
also have to fit in sundry housework in the 
hour she's asleep, so we usually don't get 
through more than a couple of books.  I hope
once Cordelia is old enough to be read to
properly we can go back to our old habits.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia is, unfortunately for Delphine, at that
Godzilla stage where she lumbers around the
house destroying things because that is all
she is capable of; she pulls books off shelves
and bends them and mouths them, she overturns 
towers of blocks and deranges puzzles.  As
an adult I can accept this, knowing it is
temporary, and I can move my precious things
to high places, but Delphine can't.  She's 
stuck down there at Cordelia's level and
she doesn't appreciate my "she's just a baby"
excuses.  I wish Delphine had her own room
where she could keep things, but for now she
is just going to have to suck it up.  I suppose
it will build character.  In a way it's nice
that she gets to go to daycare and be free
of the barbarian horde for a few hours.
</p>
<p>
Other than those unfortunate incidents, 
Delphine gets along quite well with Cordelia.
She knows that you are not supposed to snatch
toys from her, that if she has something you
want you have to find something else for her
to play with in exchange.  She shares her
food with Cordelia and she knows to ask what
babies can have.  She knows to be quiet when
Cordelia is sleeping.  She likes to make
Cordelia laugh.  She is a good big sister.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
They have this chart of verbal development
which tell you when you should worry -- say,
if your three-year-old isn't forming sentences
or if your one-and-a-half-year-old doesn't
say five words or something.  The chart goes
up to age five and apparently if Delphine were
five, we wouldn't need to worry about her verbal
development.  She knows colours, she asks the
meaning of words, she counts to ten, she knows
all the nursery rhymes.  She knows nursery
rhymes you haven't even heard of.  
</p>
<p>
She's starting to show signs of literacy;
she knows that letters are associated with 
sounds, and she has started asking "what does
that say" when we read books.  She can recognize
some words, although I am still not sure if it
is recognition of the word or just remembering
what that particular instance of that particular
word is.  I mean, we were reading an Eric Carle
book and I pointed to the word "Eric" and asked
her what it was.  She got it right, but did she
recognize the word "Eric" or did she remember it
was "Eric" from the last time we read the same
book?  Either way it's a step in the right
direction; all we need to do now is teach her
the <em>correct</em> spelling for "Erik".
</p>
<p>
I feel like I am being too braggy and I should try
and think of something bad to say about Delphine,
but I am not trying to brag.  I just really
like her.

    <p>In pseudo-preperation for biking from North of Barrie back to
Toronto, I've bought a new set of tires for my bike.  So now, instead
of the 2" knobbies, I'm riding on a set of 1.5" slicks.  I haven't
noticed the difference so far, but it's a fairly short ride from <a href="http://www.ucycle.com">the bike shop</a> to <a href="http://www.phantomfiber.com/location_contact.php">my office</a>,
and along the way, I was carrying my old tires.  I'm hoping that I'll
notice more of a difference on my ride home.</p>

<p>But that's not really why I'm posting this.  (I'm also not posting
this in an attempt to drown out Amy's talk of cute children and
chcoclate cake.)  I'm posting this because just this morning, I
changed my tires for the first time in my life!  It's true, I've never
had a flat before, and I was a little nervous about getting one one my
big trip, but now that I've changed both the front and the back wheel,
I see how easy it really is, and it's no longer a concern for me.
(The instructions I heard from a guy at <a href="http://www.mec.ca/">MEC</a> last Bike Week really helped, and it's really just not that
hard, although I expect it's a little trickier when it's pouring
rain.)</p>

<p>In other news, does anyone know of a good bike route from <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.09024,-95.712891&amp;sspn=0.953042,1.7276&amp;saddr=7+Tiny+Beaches+Rd+N,+ON+L0L+1B0,+Canada+(Georgian+Grill)+%4044.693924,-79.998813&amp;daddr=1901+Yonge+Street,+Toronto&amp;om=1">Balm Beach to Toronto</a>?</p>

<strong><em>How To Cut Your Own or Anybody Else's Hair</em> by
    Bob Bent</strong>.  This was indeed useful -- apparently the key to
    cutting your own hair is to cut a guide section in front
    and then match all the other hair up to that section, using
    lots of mirrors to see the back.  I'm pretty sure you 
    couldn't do a complicated style in this manner, but I expect
    it would work for a simple style if you could stand a
    few weeks of wearing the results of your own practice.
</p>
<p>
    Sadly some jerk decided to cut out the section on how
    to cut straight kid's hair (the straight hair of a kid, not
    the hair of a straight kid -- we don't know about that
    yet), which is of course the one thing I really wanted 
    the book for.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>On Bullshit</em> by Harry G. Frankfurt</strong>.  Of the
three bullshit books I have recently read, this is by far
the most successful, with a very intriguing conclusion.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Curse of the Narrows: The Halifax 
Explosion 1917</em> by Laura MacDonald</strong>.
I love a good disaster book, and this is a good disaster book.
I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had not tried
to read it on vacation, surrounded by a million distractions.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>False Alarm: The Truth About the Epidemic of 
Fear</em> by Marc Siegel</strong> approaches the current
American state of constant panic from a more medical point
of view.  I don't know if it's just me, or if it's all of
Canada, but I don't experience the kind of constant fear 
that he talks about, and I don't really know anyone who
does.  
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Undercover Economist: Exposing Why the Rich 
are Rich, the Poor are Poor--and Why You Can Never Buy a 
Decent Used Car!</em> by Tim Harford.</strong>  This is
a pretty interesting book about how economists think about
stuff (much like Freakonomics, but slightly less
amusing).  Harford leans a little further to the right
than I am used to, which got my back up a bit, but 
his arguments are convincing, so in the end I'm sure
it did me good.
