I mentioned in a previous post that Delphine likes to
postpone the actual sleep part of bedtime by coming
up with ingenius time-wasting requests.  I will be
sitting in the living room and I will hear the quiet
click of the bedroom door opening, and Delphine will
emerge in her adorable pajamas and look at me with
improbably large eyes and say "Mummy..."  I regard 
her seriously, and after a moment of silence I say
"Yes?"
</p>
<p>
And she says "I need another buddy."  Or, "I need cold
fresh water."  Or, "I need a
cuddle."  And today, the best yet,
</p>
<p>
"Can I be a juggler?"
</p>
<p>
I took a deep breath, tried not to laugh:  
"Yes, when you grow up you can be a juggler, but
right now you have to go to sleep."
</p>
<p>
And she solemnly turned around and climbed back 
into bed.

Tonight I did my first one-and-one — one minute of
running for each minute of walking — since my knee
injury healed.  (Previously I was doing two minute of
walking to every minute of running, so on average you
could hardly call it "running" at all.)  
It went pretty well, considering it was
thirty-two degrees with a Humidex of thirty-nine.  My 
knee was hurting a little bit, but I babied it and I'll
ice it tonight if I remember.
</p>
<p>
I noticed I'm not getting terribly out of breath on 
these runs, probably because I am running really slow.
I breath fast, but it's not that desperate, panting,
bile-taste-at-the-back-of-my-throat breathing I remember
so well from phys ed.  Ahh, phys ed.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, my friend Michelle, who was my real-life
inspiration to start running, is training for her first
half-marathon, and is documenting the whole gory process
on her 
<a href="http://30somethingrunner.blogspot.com/">running
blog</a>.  Michelle is in my choir, and we got to be
friends because she laughs at my smartass comments.
(Laughing at my jokes is a very short path to my heart.)
</p>
<p>
When I found out she runs I was a little surprised, 
because I always thought runners were kind of...
different.  Athletic.  Jockish.  That runners were
perhaps some entirely different species that I could
never fully relate to.  Since I was pretty sure that Michelle
is my kind of people, I had to reconsider my perspective
on runners, which made it possible for me to seriously
consider running myself.  And here I am, with Michelle
cheering me on.

Delphine is seldom Delphine.  Sometimes she's Pooh, and I'm
Piglet.  Sometimes she's the mummy, and I'm the baby.
Sometimes she's Ursa, and I'm Delphine.  Sometimes I am
Stella and she's Sam, and sometimes I am Sam and she's
Stella.  Lately, she has been Corduroy and I have been
Lisa.
</p>
<p>
She has a tremendous imagination.  Today she pretended
a calendar on the wall was a baby, and she was rocking
it to sleep.  Any pair of things where one is bigger
than the other become a mummy and baby: "Mummy spoon, 
mummy spoon, I am sad!  Want up mummy spoon!"  And
she holds the baby spoon approximately halfway up the
mummy spoon.  
</p>
<p>
Yesterday she and Blake were playing with balls, and
they held them on their heads and Delphine said
"Look Mummy!  We got two heads!"
</p>
<p>
It's so much fun being along for the ride with her
amazing little brain.

It recently became obvious that Delphine doesn't need to go
to bed at six-thirty any more.  We put her to bed, bright-eyed
and fresh, and she sat up and read books, or popped
out at regular intervals to make contrived requests: "Mummy!
I need sumpin'."  "What do you need?"  "I need another buddy
(stuffed toy)."  Uh-huh.
</p>
<p>
Since we had been feeding her supper at five
and then making and eating our supper after she was in bed, we
couldn't really move her bedtime any later unless we included
her in our supper, which we have done.  She sits on the 
counter and watches while we cook, or joins in and helps;
yesterday she swished the lettuce around in the cold
water to rinse off all the delightful organic lettuce
goo.  And then she eats with us; we all sit at the 
big table and make conversation like a real family.  I'm
fairly excited about this — I think eating together
is one of the nicest things you can do as a family, and
I have been looking forward to this for a long time.
</p>
<p>
It kind of hoses our evenings, though.  When Delphine 
went to bed early we could tuck her in and then
eat supper in front of the television like slobs.  It's
an appalling habit, and I suppose it's good that we
don't do it any more, but it was very efficient and
allowed for plenty of TV-watching.  With Delphine 
in bed at 
seven-thirty or eight that only leaves us a couple of
hours to tidy the kitchen and watch TV before it's
time for bed, since I am trying to get into bed before
ten so I can get enough sleep before the Cordelia wake-up
call at five-thirty in the morning.  If you take away 
half an hour for a run and another twenty minutes for
an epsom salts bath, that barely leaves enough time for
last night's <em>Daily Show</em>.  I am turning into one of those
people who are too busy, even if it's only too busy
to watch television.
</p>
<p>
It also means I have to put together a good repertoire
of quick and easy meals, which I suppose is par for the
course for people with children.
</p>
<p>
Here's our evening routine, a snapshot of life with a baby and
a three-year-old:
</p>
<p>
<strong>4:30</strong> pick Delphine up from daycare (when applicable)<br><strong>5:00</strong> snack for Delphine and I, supper for Cordelia<br><strong>6:00</strong> Cordelia's bedtime — sometime between 6:00 and 7:00
Blake gets home from work<br><strong>6:30</strong> make dinner<br><strong>7:00</strong> eat dinner<br><strong>7:30</strong> Delphine's bedtime: pyjamas, pee, brush teeth, read
two books, watch two movies on Daddy's computer, bed<br><strong>8:00</strong> I go for run (three days a week) while Blake cleans
up after dinner (yeah!)<br><strong>8:30</strong> home for dessert and TV<br><strong>9:30</strong> bath and read a book<br><strong>10:00</strong> bed<br></p>

My knee is better.  On my chiropractor's* advice I went to see
a podiatrist to see if I have any functional problems with my
feet, and he didn't find anything.  He thought it was a
"weekend warrior" injury, which I find curiously flattering
since no-one has ever accused me of being in any way 
warrior-like before.  I think he's right, I just overdid it;
not only was I wearing the wrong shoes, but I was also trying
to run like a real runner when at this stage I should be
doing the old-lady-shuffle to get my body used to this
unprecedented level of physical activity.
</p>
<p>
I resumed running a couple of weeks ago, but I only managed
to go out a couple of times before we decided to switch
our evening routine around, which left me without a good
time to go out.  Blake and I talked about it, and finally
decided that the only time I can go is after dinner.  I was
reluctant to go out after a meal, but there is no other 
good option, as I will discuss in another post (if I have
time).  And it will encourage me to eat a lighter dinner,
which I could certainly stand to do.
</p>
<p>
Last night I went for my first postprandial run and it was
great.  I didn't really want to go — it is against my nature
to leave the house after seven at night — but
go I did.  I ran on the Beltline, an old rail track nearby which
has been converted into a trail, again on my chiro's 
recommendation because it's softer and easier on the 
joints than pavement.  I thought it would be boring
running the Beltline all the time, but I really enjoy
all the people I see; couples with little kids going
out for a walk after dinner; fat people like me trying
to get fit; trim, middle-aged rich women walking briskly
in pairs or groups; serious runners with expensive
gear; groups of teenagers on bikes; people out walking 
their dogs.  Yesterday I saw an old lady out for a
fitness walk wearing white shorts and a t-shirt, 
thin putty-coloured ankle socks and 
<a href="http://www.shoes.com/productimages/shoes_ib49552.jpg">plimsoll 
runners</a>, and no bra.  And I thought I would be
bored!
</p>
<p>
I am still doing two minutes of walking and one minute
of running, which is how they start you off in the
Running Room clinic.  When I got home last night I realized
it had been a pretty easy run, so next time I will step
it up to one-and-one.  
</p>
<p style="font-size:80%">
* While my chiropractor is technically a chiropractor, the
care she gives me is mainly something called 
<a href="http://www.activerelease.com/about.asp">Active
Release Techniques</a> which is basically very targeted
massage with movement, designed to loosen tight muscles
and break down scarring.  Since pretty much all my 
physical problems stem from tight muscles in my legs and
butt it works really well
for me.  I say this because I don't want you to think
I am dumb enough to go to a chiropractor for a sore
knee — I would no more do that than go to an opthamologist
for a sore elbow.

Once upon a time, a long time ago, when Delphine was still
a baby, some friends wondered how a person who can barely
manage to feed themselves without a takeout menu
can manage to feed a child.  I used to think I would
be able to answer that question, but the fact is I
have become very domestic in the last few years; I
have a kitchen that is almost always clean enough
to cook in, I have multiple pans and knives, I have
a working dishwasher, I have enough staples on hand
to cook a dinner or bake a cake.  I even have a 
chest freezer. 
</p>
<p>
One day this could be you (well, maybe not the chest
freezer).  
The journey from urban restaurant forager to urban
chef has been one of many steps, and one of
them was having a child who needed good food, not 
just leftover pizza (although they still get that
sometimes).  So it may be that having to
feed your child properly is exactly the kick in the
pants you need to learn how to feed yourself properly too.
</p>
<p>
But that is neither here nor there -- what you need
to know right now, with your hungry six month old
on your knee, mouth agape, is how and what do I feed
her now?
</p>
<p>
Your first and best friend in this task is the boxed
baby cereal.  The one I always get is Heinz -- look
for one with as few extraneous ingredients as possible,
especially without milk or added formula.  
Lots of baby cereals have
milk in them; those cereals are for formula-fed babies
who have already been exposed to the 
hard-to-digest foreign proteins in cow's milk -- if
your baby is exclusively breastfed there is no need
to expose her to those proteins until she is ready for
them, in a couple of months.  So look for cereal that
just has grain, and probably a couple of vitamins,
in the ingredient list.  Get used to reading ingredient
lists -- you will be doing it a lot.
</p>
<p>
Start with rice cereal -- rice is the easiest grain
to digest.  If you're a champion pumper you can mix
it with breastmilk, otherwise use water.  You're
supposed to use boiled, cooled water -- I just used
whatever's in the bottom of the kettle from my last
cup of tea, which was never very long ago.   If you
trust your municipal water supply, after a while you
will just use tap water if you're lazy like me.
</p>
<p>
A little bit of cereal a couple of times a day is 
fine to start off with.  Remember, real food is just
recreational for now -- your baby gets all 
her nutrition from breastmilk (or formula) at this
stage, and will until she is a year old.
</p>
<p>
Do rice for a week, then try barley and oatmeal -- 
these are also very easy to digest.  If you are
brave enough to try them, you will find that the 
tastiest of the cereals is barley, despite being 
the unappetizing grey colour of <em>papier mache</em>.
</p>
<p>
You're supposed to wait four days or so between 
introducing new foods -- Cordelia is almost eight
months old as I write this, and I am introducing 
new foods at a manic pace of one a day or so.
You might be more conservative if you have any
concerns about allergies or if your baby is 
sensitive to new tastes and takes a while to get
used to them, or if you're just nervous.  
Whatever works for you.
</p>
<p>
After you have your baby nicely warmed up on
cereal, you can introduce fruits and veg.  My
doctor suggested doing orange, then yellow,
then green, but I think this whole process is
complicated enough without bringing the rainbow
into it.  Just introduce whatever you think would
be fun.  (See the chart I posted for ideas.)
</p>
<h4>Jarred Food or Homemade?</h4>
<p>
Both.  Jarred food is convenient, and you can get
good stuff.  You can even get organic if it's 
important to you.  Just, again, read the labels 
and don't buy anything with added sugar or starch.
If the jar says "Sweet Potato" the ingredient
list should say "sweet potato" and nothing else.
Use your good sense.
</p>
<p>
Two things to avoid: jarred banana tastes weird
because it's cooked, so it actually has that
fake banana taste, and also, how hard is it to
mash up a banana with a fork?  Buying jarred banana
is just embarrassing.  And jarred green beans 
are sour and horrible -- homemade green beans
aren't nice either; they just don't puree well.
Green beans can wait until your baby has learned
how to chew.
</p>
<p>
But homemade baby food is nice, too -- there
are lots of fruits and vegetables that you 
can't get jarred -- okra?  asparagus?  mango?
And there's a warm, fuzzy feeling to feeding
your baby something you have made with your
own hands.
</p>
<p>
How to make homemade baby food?  This is the
easiest way: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>open a bag of frozen peas</li>
<li>dump some in the beaker that came with your
hand blender (You do have a hand blender, don't
you?  How do you make milkshakes?)</li>
<li>Pour in just enough water to cover the peas</li>
<li>put a saucer over the top of the beaker</li>
<li>stick it in the microwave for a few minutes,
    until the water boils and the peas get
    a little bit soft</li>
<li>drain off the water</li>
<li>blend the peas into mush</li>
</ol>
<p>
Put some in a bowl, wait until it cools, serve.
Put the rest into those little one-cup or half-cup
Gladware containers and freeze.  (Everyone says to
use ice cube trays, but they are a pain in the
ass, and my kid easily eats a quarter-cup at a
sitting, which is way more than one ice cube.)
</p>
<p>
You can do the same with other frozen vegetables,
or frozen or canned fruit (you don't have to microwave
the fruit, obviously).  If the resulting puree 
is too runny, add some of the dry baby cereal to
thicken it.
</p>
<p>
If you have a clean knife and cutting board kicking
around, you can do much the same thing with any
fresh vegetable or fruit (with the exception of
berries and tomatoes, which can be allergenic).  
If you prefer, cook it in a 
pan on the stove, if you have a clean pan and your
stove works.
</p>
<p>
Get someone else to clean up, you have done enough.

next.

Surely every mother has experience the too-long nap.  
Or is it just me?
You put her down for a nap, you walk away,
she sleeps.  You hurry to get the things done that you can't
do while she's awake.  You answer email, you take out the
trash, you cut up meat and vegetables for dinner.  You 
still have a few minutes to sit down before she wakes up!
You don't brew tea — takes too long.  You make instant
coffee with plenty of sugar and sit down with a 
magazine or a book.  
</p>
<p>
You read a few pages, you look up.  She is still sleeping.
It's been hours.  (Really only an hour and forty minutes.)
She never sleeps this long.  Something is wrong.  She is
surely dead.  You check the clock — yes, it's really been
almost two hours.  She never sleeps this long!
</p>
<p>
What do you do?  She is almost surely fine, and sleeping
this long because she needs to sleep.  Do you check on
her, thereby ruining her nap <em>and</em> your 
much-needed quiet time?  But what if she isn't fine?  
What if she's in trouble?  Stopped breathing?  Choked
on a loose button?  Caught up in a blanket?  Fell out
of the crib and knocked herself out?  What do you do?
</p>
<p>
You decide to let her sleep and try and relax, and 
just as you are getting
to the good bit in your book, she cries.  Your stomach
loosens and you breathe deeper as you go in to lift her
up and hold her close, more beautiful than ever.
