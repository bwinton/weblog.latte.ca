    <p>
It has been way too long since I did this, and I have read about a
thousand books.  I hope I don't miss any.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</em>
by Malcolm Gladwell</strong> is a book I read before.  Since we own a copy,
and it seems to be a book that is still being referred to quite a lot
(notably in <em>Child's Play</em> by Silken Laumann) I thought I would give
it another whirl.  It's still an interesting and thought-provoking book
about the reasons why people do things, and I am glad I gave it another
read.
</p>
<p>
It was alarming, though, to realize how little of it I recalled from the
last time I read it.  It made me realize again how little I actually absorb
of the books I read.  So I have started taking notes while I read, which is
incredibly geeky, but it's such a waste of time to read so much and not really
take any of it in.  Plus it's an excuse to buy myself some cool notebooks
and pens.  (The real reason I had children is so I could buy school supplies
every August.)
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Porgy</em> by DuBose Heyward</strong>.  I got this out of the 
library because it was mentioned on the flap of the dustjacked of a wonderful
picture-book rendition of the lyrics to Gershwin's "Summertime", and I was
intrigued that <em>Porgy and Bess</em> started off as a novel.  A few pages
into the book I was tempted to give up on it because of the annoying
phonetic handling of vernacular ("Yo' bes sabe yo' talk for dem damn dice.") which
makes the book nigh-unreadable until you get used to it, and that creepy 
early-1900s racism ("Crown was crouched for a second spring, with lips drawn 
from gleaming teeth. The light fell strong upon thrusting jaw, and threw the 
sloping brow into shadow.")  But for all that I kept going because I wanted
to know what happened next, and I was interested in the characters, and it
turned out to be an enjoyable and thought-provoking read, with a couple of
excellent turns of plot.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>When Anger Hurts Your Kids: A Parent's Guide</em> by Patrick 
Fanning, Kim Paleg, Dana Landis, and Matthew McKay</strong>.  I ordered 
this book from the library because I have some trouble controlling my temper,
and when I get angry I tend to do the kind of mean things to my children
which appall me when I see other people do them on television.  Nothing
terrible, and I don't think it is bad enough to do any irreparable harm, but
I still don't like to be an asshole parent, even just on occasion.  Especially
since every mean thing I do to Delphine, she turns around and does to
Cordelia.  Nothing quite like the mirror of a child's mimicry to show you
how you really are.
</p>
<p>
So this book had some useful advice, most of which I already knew.  It covered
a lot of information about what to expect from children at different ages 
— apparently a lot of people who get angry at their children do it because
they have unreasonable expectations.  That's not my problem, I have a pretty
good handle on normal childhood development.  There was also information about
how to talk to yourself about a situation; instead of saying to yourself,
"She's dawdling to get on my nerves, she knows we are running late and she
is deliberately sabotaging me", you should say "she is at a stage where she
doesn't like to be hurried, I need to give her lots of warning,..."  But I don't
see Delphine as vindictive or deliberately difficult, either.   So that's not 
my problem, either.
</p>
<p>
My problem is that I get irritated when I ask her to do something and she 
doesn't, and that she is at a stage where she is defiant towards me specifically
because I am her mother, because she is asserting her independence from me.  
So I tell
her to do something, and she automatically says "no" because that is the stage
she is in.  Which is all well and good, but sometimes I am just not up to
jollying her along and distracting her and offering reasonable choices, sometimes
I just damn well want her to do what I tell her to, and now.  So I shout at
her.  My problem is that I need to get more sleep and to not be in constant
physical pain, or fear of it, so that I have the patience to deal with her.
The better news is that she seems to be moving out of that defiant phase
into something a little more reasonable.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Clean and Green: The Complete Guide to Non-Toxic and Environmentally
Safe Housekeeping</em> by Annie Berthold-Bond</strong>.  I have been looking
for a useful book on hippie housecleaning ever since the smell of my usual
all-purpose cleaner started to make me feel ill.  I read a couple that were 
useless, and
then I got to this one, which is about perfect.  It goes over all the
ingredients you will need to make your own safe(ish) cleaning supplies, 
discussing what they are and how they work, and
then offers about a million recipes for each application.  I used to seek
the one perfect recipe for each product (all-purpose cleaner, tub scourer, etc)
but I think this way is better, since it allows you to tailor your cleaners
to your needs.  
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I liked this book so much that I went out and bought
a copy, and it now lives in my kitchen for easy reference at any time.
I like how making your own cleaning products brings an element of creativity
to the cleaning process.
</p>
<p>
The only concern I have with this book is that it treats Borax as if it were
as non-toxic as vinegar and baking soda, which it really isn't.  
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Thinking Fan's Guide to the World Cup</em> by Matt Weiland and
Sean Wilsey</strong>.
</p>
<p>
This book is a collection of essays, one for each team in the World Cup 
finals, about football and the countries themselves and how they relate.
Some of the essays are more about football, some of them are more about the
country, some of them aren't really about either, but most of them are good
and interesting and added another dimension to the whole World Cup 
experience.
</p>
<p>
I had this on order from the library months ago, but it only came in just
before the end of the World Cup.  I managed to squeeze in a couple of essays 
— Italy and France, of course, and Brazil and England — before
the Final.  The Brazil essay, by John Lanchester, has a wonderful description
of why football is such a beautiful game, and so thrilling and hard
to watch:
</p>
<blockquote>
That's what you learn, as soon as you start to play and watch 
football: that football is difficult and beautiful, and that 
the two are related.  Players kick the ball to one another, 
pass into empty space which is suddenly filled by a player 
who wasn't there two seconds ago and who is running at full 
pelt and who without looking or breaking stride knocks the 
ball back to a third player who he surely can't have seen 
who then, also at full pelt and without breaking stride, 
crosses the ball at sixty miles an hour to land on the 
head of a fourth player who has run seventy meters to get 
there and who, again all in stride, jumps and heads the 
ball with, once you realize how hard this is, unbelieveable 
power and accuracy toward a corner of the goal just exactly 
where the goalkeeper, executing some complex physics entirely 
without conscious thought and through muscle-memory, has 
expected it to be, so that all this grace and speed and 
muscle and athleticism and attention to detail and power 
and precision passion comes to nothing, will never appear 
on a score-sheet or match report and will likely be forgotten 
a day later by everybody who saw it or took part in it.  This 
is the beauty and also the strange fragility, the 
evanescence of football.
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong><em>Access All Areas</em> by Ninjalicious</strong> is a book about
urban exploration, which is the fine art of going places you're
not supposed to go, mainly abandoned buildings or parts of buildings, 
construction sites, drainage systems, and the like.  This book is very
well-written; Ninjalicious (if that is his real name!) is funny, persuasive,
passionate, and strongly moral, which makes it all the more miserable that
he died (almost exactly a year ago) of some 
<a href="http://www.uer.ca/forum_showthread.asp?fid=&amp;threadid=22279&amp;currpage=6&amp;pp#post112">stupid 
liver disease</a>.  So donate
your organs, people, you won't need them after you're dead.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Affluenza: The All-Consuming Epidemic</em> by John De Graaf, David 
Wann, and Thomas H. Naylor</strong> is a book which I'm sure I must have read
years ago in my anti-establishment, screw-The-Man days, but which I don't
remember at all.  It is all about how Americans decided sometime in the
fifties to put money and things before time, so now we (they) are all working
their asses off to earn plenty of money to buy things they don't have time
to enjoy, and how stupid is that?  
</p>
<p>
They covered some very interesting material about philosophical insights into
leisure time; the fact that this stuff is new to me suggests that I didn't
actually read this book before, because I am all about the leisure and I
am sure I would have remembered it if I had come across it.  Apparently
plenty of very intelligent people have thought long and hard about the need
to take time away from work and walk around or read or garden or mess about
in boats.  I thought I was just lazy, but no, I was walking in the 
intellectual footsteps of some of the greatest thinkers in history.
</p>
<p>
The authors tend to profligately blame
affluenza for all the troubles of our time, from obesity to pollution, which
is mostly fair but gets a little hysterical after eight chapters.
Anyway, thought-provoking, interesting, I give it two thumbs up.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Bringing Back The Dodo</em> by Wayne Grady</strong> 
This is
a collection of essays about nature and science, quite interesting although
some of Grady's pet theories are pretty useless; the man desperately needs
to read <em>Guns, Germs and Steel</em>.  When he's not theorizing he's 
smart and readable.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Devil May Care</em> by Sheri McInnis</strong> is a fluffy beach 
read which I
actually read on a beach; possibly a lifetime first for me.  (I didn't care
much for beaches before I had children.  Don't care much for them now, really.)
A pleasant read with an interesting meta-physical twist and a surprisingly
ambiguous conclusion.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Cat's Eye</em> by Margaret Atwood</strong> was more enjoyable than
I thought it would be.  (I just read it because I'm Canadian and I should and 
it's good for me, kind of like I eat Red River Cereal.  Chew, chew, chew,
chew.)  It was a bit hard
to read as the mother of girls — is this what they're in for?   But I
really (really, painfully) related to the protagonist's attitude to men and
women, and after I decided not to read it at the cottage but save it for the
city, I really got into it. (It's not really a cottage book; too depressing,
too much thought required.)
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>A Thousand Barrels A Second: The Coming Oil Break Point and the 
Challenges Facing An Energy Dependent World</em> by James Tertzakian</strong>.
There's one of those self-explanatory sub-titles for you.  This is the more
sane version of that <em>The Long Emergency</em> book by James Kunstler I
read last year; Tertzakian thinks we are coming to a break point in the oil
economy — there is a limited supply of oil, and soon it will become
too expensive to fuel our economy in the manner to which we have all become
accustomed.  Kunstler figures there is going to be some kind of post-industrial
revolution, millions will die and the rest of us will go back to living in the 
Shire; Tertzakian thinks the change will be slow enough to allow us to adapt,
with some difficulty, and that technology will ultimately save the day.
</p>
<p>
I am leaning towards Tertzakian's view, if only because it is a little less
scary.  I think life is going to become drastically different in the next
few decades, and I think the twentieth century will be looked on as one of
unparalleled energy consumption, but I think we will be able to make the
transition to a less energy-intensive society without too much pain, at least
here in nice stable Canada.  I also think cheap, consumer 
airplane travel will sooner or later
be history, so do your international trips now before the government gets smart
and starts taxing aviation fuel like they should.
</p>
<p>
Blake and I are sitting pretty in this whole situation because we have,
almost accidentally, made a life for ourselves which is much less oil-intensive
than the average North American's.  We don't have a car, Blake bikes to work,
I can do all my errands without even using public transit.  I  buy
local produce as much as I can, and lean towards organics where practical.
We live in a multi-family dwelling, so we don't spend as much on heating as
we would in a house.  All in all, when the revolution (or evolution) comes,
it is going to be much less painful for us than it will for the Joe Suburb 
family who live miles away from the grocery store and need two cars just to
carry on their business.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>How Not To Be The Perfect Mother</em> by Libby Purves</strong>.
I had to buy this from Amazon because the Toronto Public Library doesn't have
a copy, except in Cantonese.  It arrived yesterday, just in the nick of time
because I needed a morale boost.  Libby Purves is a mother of two who tells
is like it is.  Like it <em>really</em> is.  On breast feeding:
</p>
<blockquote>
Let nobody kid you that breastfeeding is not going to be hell at first.  That 
mammary lobbyists are so keen to promote 'breast is best' (well, it is) that 
many of them have tended to slide rather dishonestly over the discomfort and
exhaustion of the first weeks.  Consequently, I suspect, a lot of willing mothers
give up, convinced that they are rare cases who 'can't do it'.  And indeed,
anyone with throbbing, bleeding nipples, dreadful heavy swollen red bosoms,
sharp needling letdown pains and a baby who still demands feeding every hour
and a half at six weeks old, is entitled to any tantrum she cares to throw.
I remember waking my husband up at 3 a.m. one painful morning with the words,
'Shall I tell you something?  I <em>hate</em> bloody breastfeeding, that's
what!'  There are many paintings of the Madonna and Child, but in none of these
has the feeding Madonna got her teeth clenched and her toes curled, as the
dreadful infant mouth takes its first agonizing drag.
</blockquote>
<p>
She makes mothering a baby sound like the cross between the appalling annoyance
and the jolly adventure that it really is (often in the same hour,) and it's such
a relief to know that I am not the only one who finds it so.
</p>
<blockquote>
Another great advantage of handing new babies around to everybody ('The milk
bill?  Ah, yes, I'll just find the money — take the baby, would you?')
is that new babies need to be talked to.  And you may not feel like doing it.
Next to the section on 'bonding' in the baby books, there is generally a 
paean of praise for mothers who talk all the time to their babies, maintain
'eye contact', allow infants to study their faces endlessly, and stick out 
their tongues to test reflexes.  This is fine, when you have the time and if 
you are fortunate enough to have developed an instant adoration of the baby.
If you are busy, or tired, or depressed at your life with this unsmiling
little creature which gives nothing back and wakes you up four crippling times
a night, the task of chatting to it may loom as unwelcome as all the other
hundred jobs you have to do in your twenty-four-hour day.  Despite underlying
love, I hated talking to my second child for nearly two months; she never
smiled until then, and I was exhausted, ill, and in constant jealous demand
from the older child.
</blockquote>
<p>
Just to read someone admit that other mothers sometimes feel this way is 
immensely reassuring and makes the whole business a lot easier to deal with.
Babies are hard, dude.
Okay, just one more quote (I love this woman; I would just retype this
whole book if it wouldn't be faster to lend it to you):
</p>
<blockquote>
When my son was four weeks old, he had only been to three places in his life:
hospital, home and the Olympia Horse Show.  We had friends with a box, and
permanent guest tickets, and the baby's godfather John Parker was driving
his coach-and-four in the final tableau and taking a team of Hungarian greys
through an avenue of fire.  So every single night I set off across London
with the basket, wearing a loose-fitting lurex top to combine the constant
feeding with a gesture towards glamour; and every night, in the box, Nicholas
lay in state while friendly drunken Scotsmen lurched up to press lucky pound
notes into his fist.  He smiled at everyone, fed contentedly, and dozed off
while Dorian Williams bawled his commentary on the show-jumping across the vast
arena below.  'Thank God,' the baby seemed to be saying, his beady eyes
swivelling busily around the scene, 'someone has at last understood my
requirements.'  All he had ever wanted, to keep him passably amused, was ten
thousand people, four military bands, two hundred horses and a boxful of
tipsy admirers.
</blockquote>

I'm into two and ones, two minutes of running and one
minute of walking.  I've been for two runs at that pace
and they have been hard but not impossible.  I had to
consciously slow myself down so that I would be able
to get through the two minutes a couple of times, and
some of those one minute breaks seemed pretty short,
but I've managed.  I think I will do another couple of
runs at this pace before I move to three-and-ones; so
far I have only done two-and-one in the blistering 
heat and humidity, so I am curious to see how they are
in reasonable weather.
</p>
<p>
Also next weekend my Learn To Run clinic (second
attempt) begins; they will start back at one-and-twos
so I will be in great shape for that.
</p>
<p>
I continue to shock myself with how motivated I am
to run, but I know why.  I usually exercise because
I knew I should exercise, because it's Good For Me.
I don't know what the human aversion is to
doing things just because they're Good For You, but
it definitely exists:  I hated to exercise and would
create all kinds of excuses not to do it.
</p>
<p>
But running has managed to elude being categorized
as exercise in my brain; somehow it seems to have
slipped into some kind of Hobbies and Activities
category.  I run for the sake of running, not for
the exercise or because it's good for me or to lower
my cholesterol or lose weight.  I run so that I 
can run more, so
that I get better at it, so that I can do a 5K in
September.
</p>
<p>
So much so, in fact, that when I noticed my shorts
were getting a little looser it took me a while to
think that, yeah, it's probably because of the
running.  I actually thought, surely twenty minutes
of running three times a week wouldn't make that 
much difference.  But I haven't changed anything
else, so that must be it.  (Unless I do have some
wasting disease, which was my first thought.)

We installed new compact fluorescents in the bathroom
because the government told us to.  Delphine, of course,
doesn't miss a trick, and she said,

and it is about homonyms and homophones, so she's had
them on her mind lately), and the other day she 
said "There are two mangoes!  Mango the colour,
and mango the fruit!"  And I wasn't sure whether
to correct her or not; it's not exactly a homophone
because the two words are obviously related, but I
hate to split hairs with her on something so esoteric.
She's three!
</p>
<h4>Poop</h4>
<p>
Today we had everyone over for dinner.  After we were
all finished eating Delphine decided she had to use
the facilities, which are unfortunately right next
to the dining area, and she still does all her business
with the door open.  So she did her thing, which
of course turned out to be pretty noisy, and we all
laughed.
</p>
<p>
"Are you laughing at me?  I just farted!"
</p>
<p>
"Farts are funny," I said, which provoked a short
discussion about why it's not funny when Zaida farts.
I said we're laughing on the inside.
</p>
<p>
Then Delphine said "I have lots of farts.  I'm 
full of farts!"
</p>
<p>
And then she got off the toilet and assumed the
"please wipe my bum" position so I had to excuse myself
and take care of her business while trying not to 
pee myself laughing.  Ah, parenthood.

Tuesday was my birthday, and I am finally thirty-one.  
Thirty-one is a bit more convincing than thirty, which
sounds a bit like you're making it up, or at least
rounding.  And when you're thirty-one you're really,
properly in your thirties, not just, thirty.
</p>
<p>
Delphine's daycare is closed this week, so I invited
a bunch of her friends over and the day that worked
for everyone happened to be my birthday, so we had
Ursa and Tanya over, and Dexter and Ellen and Maxine.
I was talking to Delphine about our plans for the
day over breakfast, and I said, "Who's coming over
today?"  She said "Dexter."  "Who else?"  "Ellen,
and Maxine."  
</p>
<p>
I said, "Who else?"
</p>
<p>
She said, "Who?"
</p>
<p>
"Ursa!"
</p>
<p>
"Ursa?"  She looked slightly alarmed.  "Two friends?"
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, two friends!  Is two friends too many?"
</p>
<p>
"Yeah.  Why two friends?"
</p>
<p>
It turned out that two friends wasn't actually too
many, but she didn't like the idea of it.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, we got some KFC (which I always have for my
birthday), and Morgan and Kathryn came over too, and
Morgan brought cake, so
the house was noisy and full of fun for my birthday,
which I love.  I was absolutely exhausted by the end
of it all, but it was a good exhaustion.  I like my
friends.  And my friends' children.
</p>
<p>
Then tonight was the family dinner; Morgan and Erik
and Baba and Zaida came over and we had steak and 
mashed potatoes and honey-spice cake which Blake
made for me.  
</p>
<p>
It has been a nice birthday, unambitious and simple
and thoroughly enjoyable.

<p>It would have been a lot shorter if I hadn't made three wrong
turns.  The first was missing the short turn South from Holland
Landing Road onto Bridge Street, and instead going up Bathurst to the
"No Exit" sign.  (I'm very glad I decided to stop when I saw that
sign, since the road got quite a bit worse after that.)  The map I'm
using makes it look like you can just continue along the Holland
Landing Road, and it will turn into the Bridge Street, but you really
do need to jog South.</p>

<p>The second was trying to take the North Simcoe Rail Trail, which
turned out to be much like the Belt Line or the Don Valley Trail, in
that it was unpaved gravel, but worse, in that it was overgrown by
flowers, bushes, and grasses.  It also turned out to not be a
continuous trail, and at one point (between Golf Course Road and
Hendrie Road) I came across an electrified fence, beyond which were
six or seven cows.  Now, there were warnings that some sections of the
trail ran through private property, and because we're not in England,
where there are Right Of Way laws which force people to let travellers
through, some of the owners have decided to disallow access through
their sections.  I'm fine with that.  Of course, since there was no
way around, I had to backtrack to the last road.  The thing that irks
me is that there was no indication that that section of trail was a
dead end, so instead of just cutting around it, I had to waste my time
finding out for myself.  Between that, and the slow pace I had to take
while riding through the weeds, and the many road crossings, which
slowed me down even further, I resolved to stick to paved roads for
the rest of the trip.</p>

<p>The third was the longest inadvertent detour, and most
disheartening of all.  When I was heading out of Elmvale, I thought I
was on Highway 6, which would take me straight to Balm Beach Road, but
I was actually on Highway 27, which, if you don't take the Highway 6
exit, turns to the right, and heads off to Waverley after going up a
huge hill.  A nice couple asked me if I knew where I was, and I had
them convinced for a second that we were all in Wyevale, because how
could I be <i>that</i> far off course?  But no, I was, indeed, that
far off course, and had to backtrack to Highway 6 to continue my
journey.</p>

<p>Between the extra mileage from the wrong turns, and the extra
mileage from trying to avoid hills and traffic by heading up Leslie
instead of up Yonge, and by trying to take the North Simcoe Rail Trail
and the Tiny Trail, I ended up biking 172 km on the way there, making
that my first Imperial Century (107 miles).  (And I'm not just saying
that so that I can have ridden more than <a href="http://crazybikerchick.blogspot.com/2006/07/my-first-century.html">Tanya</a>.)  For comparison, on the way back, starting and ending at
the same points, I only went 131 km (81 miles).</p>

    <p>
We just got home from a week at the cottage; at <em>a</em>
cottage, I should say, a place we (or more accurately, Blake's
parents) rented for a week up on Georgian Bay.  The cottage
was right on the beach, and we spent a restful week playing
in the water, sitting on the beach, eating corn and ice
cream and making sand castles.
</p>
<p>
The first day we were there Cordelia started standing on
her own, and she spent the rest of the week practicing;
she can stay up for about twenty seconds before she plops
down onto her bottom.  As soon as we got home we set her
up with Delphine's old push cart thing, and she loves to
zoom around with it (although she can't steer yet —
she goes in a straight line until she runs into something).
</p>
<p>
Delphine spent the week basking in all the attention
from her Baba and Zaida, and conquering her fear of
the water.  She's scared of pretty much everything
these days, so it was great for her to have an 
opportunity to confront something scary with the
support of such tireless cheerleaders.  And she
did great — by the end of the week she was 
happily walking into the lake by herself, jumping
over waves and playing in the water.
</p>
<p>
Blake and I had a nice week too, as you can imagine 
with two extra sets of hands around to help look after
the girls.  We both got lots of reading done, and 
we fit in a romantic walk on the beach and a nice
dinner as well.  
</p>
<p>
Delphine also went through a lot of books; I packed
a couple of Pooh books, a Stella and Sam book and
another library book with a watery theme.  Unfortunately
the cottage we rented came ready-stocked with some
crappy kids books which, of course, Delphine loved.
(I have heard from a couple of sources that children
will naturally gravitate towards quality books,
but Delphine certainly doesn't; some of her favourite
books are garbage and I have to "lose" them because
I can't bear to read them any more.)  Among a 
whole selection of
lousy books (and a couple of good ones; a Robert
Munsch and some Arthur books) at the cottage 
were picture-book-length adaptations
of <em>Disney's Aladdin</em>, <em>Disney's The Little
Mermaid</em> and <em>Disney's The Jungle Book</em>.
(Spotting a trend here?)  You can't really fit an
hour and a half of movie into thirty paragraphs, so
there was a lot of "Suddenly!" and sentences like
"Aladdin tricked
the genie into taking them out of the cave on a 
magic carpet," or "It took a lot of tricks for Baloo
and Bagheera to free Mowgli from the monkeys!"  
I don't remember the movies, but something
tells me that's at least fifteen minutes of film
and no small amount of characterisation and action
squeezed into one lousy little sentence. 
</p>
<p>
Delphine's favourite of those three was Aladdin.
Her favourite character was the genie, and her 
favourite line, which she repeated all
week, was "Proceed!  Touch nothing but the lamp!'  
which is a pretty great sentence when uttered
completely out of any context in a <em>very gruff</em>
voice by a three-foot-tall girl.  "<em>Proceed!
Touch nuffing but da lamp!</em>"
</p>
<p>
The girls each had their own bedroom at the cottage,
and the result of that was that they both slept
better; Cordelia was sleeping until 6:30 instead
of 5:30, and Delphine started sleeping until after
seven!  I am pretty excited about buying a house
now.
</p>
<p>
All in all, the week at the cottage was a success 
— we expect we will do it again next year,
even Blake who hates the great outdoors.  We will
probably try and get a nicer cottage next year; this
one was kind of, um, retro.

My daughter the goth: "I like to be dead."  She talks about
being dead a lot, but I don't think it means what she thinks
it means, because apparently it can be cured by eating corn.

My daughter the... I don't even know if there is a word

to Balm Beach on my bicycle.  Well, the date has been set, and it's
this coming Saturday.  I've done a couple of successively longer rides
after the 87km Musselman Lake ride, a 103km ride out to Holland
Landing and back, and a 126km ride up to Keswick and back.  I've
planned out a route (see right), and think it should be a long, but
do-able ride.  It's a little bit longer than my longest ride (which
was yesterday, up to Keswick and back), but I'm going to start earlier
(8:00am from Steeles, instead of 9:00am from Finch), and I don't mind
finishing later.  (I finished the Keswick ride, including taking the
subway home from Finch, at 5:30pm, but these days, it's light out
until almost 9:00pm.  I don't really want to be biking for 13 hours
continuously, but it's good to know that the option is there, if I
decide to stop for a really long lunch, or something.)</p>
