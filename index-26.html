Blake and I usually tidy up the living room every
night after the girls are in bed, but last night we
were just too tired and couldn't be bothered.  
</p>
<p>
This morning Delphine was appalled when she came
into the living room.
</p>
<p>
"It's so messy!  It was messy ALL NIGHT!  You guys were supposed
to tidy up!"
</p>
<p>
I think 4:30 has just officially become "Tidy-Up 
Time".  "You guys" indeed!

    <p>Cc:-ed to the MacPython list, because they might know.</p>
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I'm trying to get Subversion bindings for my installed version of
MacPython (/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/)  This
seems to mean that I want to install Subversion, and if so, I would
like to get it hooked up to Apache so that I can connect to
http://svn.latte.ca/ (or whatever) on my work computer and access my
home repository.</p>

<p>Now, I can install the subversion python bindings using
DarwinPorts, but that won't hook into the Framework version of Python,
so I've downloaded the Subversion 1.3.2 sources, and I can build them,
but they complain about my version of Apache.  Specifically, about
apxs being too old.</p>

<p>Do I really need to upgrade apache to Apache 2 to get this all
working?</p>

<p>Is there a good way of replacing the default Apache with Apache 2,
or is that a really bad idea because the Software Update will get
horribly confused?</p>

<p>Is there another place I should be asking these questions?</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>
Blake.</p>

<strong><em>The Highly Sensitive Child: Helping our children thrive
when the world overwhelms them</em> by Elaine Aron</strong>.  After
Delphine decided she hated music class because the leader was too
loud, a friend recommended I read this book.  It is about the
15 to 20 percent of children who are apparently highly sensitive,
and how to parent them effectively without making them miserable.
</p>
<p>
So is Delphine highly sensitive?  Kind of...  she's unusually sensitive
to noises, and to the emotional state of others.  Combine the two and 
logically you could determine that she is very sensitive to 
noisy expressions of emotion, as we saw at the music class and
as Baba's friend Ann found out.  (She had cause to gasp loudly in
surprise in Delphine's presence once; Delphine cried
a lot, and ever since then Delphine has periodically mentioned,
"Ann shouted, and then I cried.  Why did Ann shout?")
</p>
<p>
It does make her easy to discipline by shouting at her, but I'm
not a big proponent of the "Discipline by Scaring the Shit out of
your Child" method, so I try to avoid it.  (Easier said than done,
since shouting is what I do when I'm angry, and getting angry is
what I do when I'm depressed, and depressed is what I get alarmingly
easily, it seems.  More about that later, though.)
</p>
<p>
Delphine's not sensitive to other things that the book discusses
though; she doesn't care if her food touches, and she isn't bothered
by tags on clothing or seams on socks or tactile annoyances of
that nature.  Thank goodness, because it seems like it would be
irritating to have to work around those kinds of sensitivities.
I am quite sympathetic to Delphine's sensitivities because I think
I share them (I will read the adult version of the book sometime
and see) and so I can quite easily understand her and figure out
what is going to upset her, especially now that I have read this
book and know what patterns and situations to watch for.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn't read this book if you don't think you have a sensitive
child, because that would be borrowing trouble — if you don't
have to worry about this stuff I would strongly recommend you 
don't.  But if you think your child might be sensitive, or seems
to react disproportionately to certain situations, this book is
probably worth a look.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Vices of My Blood</em> by Maureen Jennings</strong>
is a murder mystery set in Victorian Toronto, which is just
brilliant.  I love getting a picture of what Toronto was like in
the past, and Jennings does a great job painting that picture.
The characters are appealing and the mystery was good; what more
can you ask?
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>How To Read Literature Like A Professor: A Lively
and Entertaining Guide To Reading Between The Lines</em> by
Thomas C. Foster</strong>.  I am frankly a little pissed off that
I haven't read this book before.  I have been hinting around needing
a book like this for ages — when I read <em>How To Read and 
Why</em> by Harold Bloom, I thought it really failed to discuss
the How part.  This book does.
</p>
<p>
The book is a high-level discussion of the symbolism found in
literature: every trip is a quest; eating is always significant,
usually of communion or trust among the eaters;
weather is usually about something other than weather; and so on.
Foster also discusses sonnets, and briefly (one chapter each)
touches on Shakespeare, the Bible, Children's Literature, and mythology
(mainly Greek) as precursors or fodder for allusions or roots or 
— there must be a word for this but I can't think of it —
anyway, stuff that writers allude or refer to in order 
to enrich their text.  Foster discusses intentionality (did the
author really mean that to be a symbol/allusion/pattern?  Answer: yes.)
and irony, and then caps the whole thing off with a short story
to practice your newfound skills on.
</p>
<p>
I love this book.  I might buy a copy.  It makes me wish I had read
it before I read <em>Cat's Eye</em> because I am sure I missed a 
whole lot in that book by just reading for plot.  But I have the
rest of my life to try and read more deeply.
</p>
<p>
It made me think, though.  First, reading like a professor seems like
a lot of work; you have to keep track of symbols, you have to look
for patterns, you have to try and figure out where you have seen this
story or this character before, you are always looking for the next
layer or layers of meaning below the simple action and dialogue in
the story.  And is it worth it?  Do you really get that much more
out of the book?  I guess you do, or else no-one would bother.
</p>
<p>
And then, after you have been doing that for a few years and get
good at it and do it automatically, mustn't it be horribly 
disappointing when you pick up a normal book, a potboiler someone
left at the cottage or something, and you keep trying to find
depths of meaning that just aren't there?  
</p>
<p>
Like when you are used
to watching <em>Buffy</em> and <em>Firefly</em>, and you watch
a regular show and you realize that the enticing hints being
dropped will never be picked up on, that the characters really
are as one-dimentional as they seem, that the really obvious
foreshadowing is actually just plain foreshadowing and not the clever 
misdirect you assumed it would be.  
</p>
<p>
It must be like when you
drink Manischewitz kosher wine and at first it tastes like
sweet grape juice and you are waiting for the hit of spiciness
or mellowness or depth that you would get if it were a good
wine, like maybe ice wine... but instead it just turns sour
and flat.
</p>
<p>
And another thing.  The short story he gives as an example to
practice on.  It's a lovely story and being the simple-minded
lass I am, I enjoyed it for the characters and the plot and
the setting.  Then I re-read it and tried to find the symbolism
and allusions and the meaning, and I came up with a couple of
pretty good insights.  Then I read the professor's interpretation,
and as it turns out the end of the story is a big huge, 
kind-of-obvious reference to Persephone's journey into Hades which
I <em>entirely missed</em>, not surprisingly because I know
nothing about Greek mythology (although Foster did helpfully
present the myth earlier in the book, so I can't entirely
plead ignorance.)  
</p>
<p>
But now I have this idea that reading
like a professor is like solving a riddle, and that in this
case I have failed. I know that isn't entirely true;
I'm sure that having been able to see that allusion contributes
to one's appreciation of the story and therefore it is valuable,
but I enjoyed the story for what I got out of it without making
that connection.  But I can't help but feel like I got it wrong,
somehow, and that I have to "solve" each piece of literature as
if it were a mathematical problem.
</p>
<p>
Thus I conjure up an image of myself poring through heaps
of classics trying to figure out the hidden meaning, and triumphantly
snapping each one closed and setting it aside as I "decode" it.
"Figured out that one!  Next!"  Which I am sure is not the point.

<p>As I <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/firstpost.html">mentioned
before</a>, we got a Mac Mini.  It's been a bit of a pain getting it all
set up, but I think we're finally done.  The web server is moved over,
along with all the websites.  The mail server is moved over, and I took
the opportunity to delete my mother's account.  (That's not as bad as it
sounds.  She had it redirecting to GMail anyways, and the error message
says as much.  Of course, since I haven't told her about it yet, this
will probably come as a bit of a surprise.)  Uh, and that turned out to
be all the servers I was running.  Well, I was running CherryPy, and
some other stuff, but it wasn't particularly important, and I've found
better ways of doing it, for the most part.</p>
<p>But that's not really why I'm posting here.  I'm posting here because
I got some cool Python stuff working under the Mac, and I wanted to
share it.  Specifically, I (or rather, my wife and I) wanted to have a
window showing on the login screen, displaying <a href="http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/city/pages/on-143_metric_e.html">the
weather</a>.  After several bits of trial and error, and liberal
"borrowing" from <a href="http://livingcode.org/">Dethe Elza</a>'s <a href="http://livingcode.org/project/pastels/">Pastels project</a> I
finally got something which would do what I wanted.  First, the code:</p>

    <p>Delphine (still) asks us why a lot.  Sadly, sometimes I don't have a
good answer, which sort of led to the conversation we had this
afternoon.<br><br>
[First scene.  Two cactuses are dancing.]<br>
Delphine: "Why are the cactuses?"<br>
Me: "Well, uh, they just are.  Questions about why a thing is don't really
have answers."<br><br>
[Next scene.  A goat has paint on himself.]<br>
Delphine: "Why is he dirty?"<br>
Me: "..."<br>
Delphine: "He's dirty cause he was painting."<br></p>
<p>So, I guess some questions about why a thing is something are easy to
answer but some questions about why a thing is something have no good

"intrinsic", or "just because"?</p>

The short-term goal of all this running foolishness is
to run the 5K event in the Toronto
Waterfront Marathon on September 24th, in aid of the
<a href="http://www.awhl.org/">Assaulted Women's Helpline</a>.
Initially my friend Michelle talked me into doing the 5K
walk because she is involved with the helpline, and then
I decided to upgrade to the run.  And now I have to collect
pledges, which I hate doing.  I sent out email, and I am posting
here, and hopefully that will earn me enough pledges to
get me off the hook.
</p>
<p>
It makes it easier that this is a pretty compelling cause.
If you
want some idea of why the helpline is needed, go to their
chilling page on 
<a href="http://www.awhl.org/security.htm">how to erase your
online tracks</a>.  Can you imagine
living under that kind of scrutiny, with someone who
believes they are entitled to that kind of control
over you, and having no way out?  It makes me angry just
thinking about it.
</p>
<p>
So if you want to pledge some money for a good cause,
or just to express your astonishment that I am actually
running anywhere for any reason, 
<a href="https://www.icanpledge.com/cyberpledge/pledge.asp?member_id=6347&amp;org_id=130&amp;fund_id=74">here's my online pledge page</a>.  Thank you!

I went running last night with my friend Michelle, my real-life
inspiration for all this perspiration.  It was the first time I
have been running with someone else, apart from the clinic.  It
was easier than running alone; the time goes a little faster.
We chatted about this and that and she gave me some hard won
running tips.  (Breathing is good!)    She is training for a
half-marathon which means she runs for, like, multiple hours
at a time, and is doing hill training and real athletic things
like that.  That's so cool!
</p>
<p>
Since I was running with company (company, moreover, with a
fancy interval-timing watch) I decided to try three-and-ones 
for the first time.  The first set was fairly hard but we
slowed down a little and the rest were quite doable, if a
smidgen on the long side.  
</p>
<p>
Running with someone was fun, but running alone is nice, 
too — it's good to have some
time alone with myself.  I think it will be less pleasant as I
increase my running time; I imagine it will be harder work and I
will find it more difficult to keep my mind off the pain, or
maybe the boredom.  Perhaps that is when I will treat myself to
an iPod.
</p>
<p>
I'm back in a Learn To Run clinic again; last Saturday was
the first meeting.  Obviously, since I attended the first two
weeks of the last clinic before my injured knee forced me to
drop out, it was all familiar material.  The run portion was
a cakewalk for me since it was two minutes walking, one minute
running, although we were running a little faster than I have
been.  I hit it off with another girl and we ran quite far behind
everyone else.  She was embarrassed but I didn't care; better to
run slow and keep running than to run fast, save face, and hurt
yourself.

Cordelia is talking.  She says "Cat".  Okay, she says
"Gah!"  But she says it a lot, when she sees a cat.  "Gah!  Gah gah 
gah!"  And she grins, and claps her hands.  She loves the gahs.
</p>
<p>
She isn't walking yet, but she stands with aplomb, holding things in
her hands, picking them up, putting them down again, drinking from her
sippy cup while holding something in her other hand and not falling
over, all at the same time.
</p>
<p>
She has an excellent sense of humour, with a particular taste for
the absurd; silly hats, funny faces, things where they are not 
supposed to be give her pleasure and result in infectious throaty
chuckles.  She also likes it if you run towards her making silly
noises and then nibble her on the neck.  But then, who doesn't? 
Try it on your boss sometime.
</p>
<p>
She is a bit mischievious; the other day I was on the 
computer while she played and Delphine was napping on the big
bed.  I suddenly noticed that Cordelia was heading into our bedroom
to torment Delphine, so I pushed my chair back and said "uh-uh";
Cordelia immediately squealed with delight and accelerated, her little hands 
slap-slap-slapping on the hardwood.  "Chase me!"  Little monster!
</p>
<p>
She sleeps quite well, provided she is not disturbed.  I put
her down after a short ritual at about 6:30, and she sleeps until
6:00 the next morning, with maybe one or two breaks to howl a
couple of times, then back to sleep.  She's fairly easily woken, so we
have had to move Delphine's bed into the office/living room.
Poor Delphine goes to bed in the big bed and then when we come to
bed we move her into the office; she has been squeezed out of her
own bedroom altogether.  I guess that's the price you pay
for being the one who sleeps well.  It will be nice when they
each have their own room.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia doesn't like to be spoon-fed, so I feed her finger food
as much as I can; toast, crackers, cereal, beans, zucchini,
cooked carrot, fruit.  She gets a fairly good variety, most
of which seems to go on the floor.  But she's still nursing
three or more times a day, so I am not too worried about it.
</p>
<p>
It seems weird that she is almost a year old.  I am glad;
I am looking forward to having two walking, talking, 
going-to-the-bathroom-all-by-themselves kids.  But it still
seems kind of soon, somehow.  This baby is growing up much faster
than  the last one did.

Yesterday Delphine and Cordelia and I went out to run some errands.
On the way home Delphine said, "Do you remember the Vikings?  In 
Daddy's movie?"
</p>
<p>
I didn't remember, but she went on to tell me the story of the 
Vikings, most of which I missed but which ended with "They went
home.  The end."  
</p>
<p>
Then she decided she was going to be a Viking, so she put on her
imaginary
Viking helmet and charged around happily shouting "Vike!  Vike!
Vike!"

<p>Based on my experiences with tricky detours heading up to Balm
Beach, I thought that I should just take nice straight routes home,
and see how that worked out.  So I took Highway 6/27 straight into
Barrie, then Concession Road 10 to Bradford, then Yonge Street stright
to Finch Station.</p>

<p>As I said in the previous post, there was some craziness on the
trip back.  The weather prediction was a 40% chance of thunderstorms.
I figure those are better odds than you would get at a casino, and I
don't really have any other way to get home, so it didn't really
affect my planning.  I got to Barrie in record time, and figured that
if the rest of the trip was that easy, I would have nothing to worry
about.  After an Iced Capp at Timmy's I made my way onto Concession
Road 10, and kept on keeping on.  Sure enough, 20 minutes out of
Barrie, the skies opened, and a torrential downpour started.  For most
of it I was reduced to peering out of one mostly-closed eye, seeing
only a few tens of feet ahead of me, since the rain was apparently
pelting its way <i>through</i> my sunglasses, to hit me in the eyes.
I suppose, in retrospect, that that was a good clue to me that I
should have pulled over to the side of the road, and waited it out,
but at the time, I figured I should just keep on riding, over to the
edge more so that cars wouldn't hit me, because who knows how long the
rain would last, and I didn't want to be stuck standing there for
hours.  Well, the rain didn't last that long, but it did manage to
completely soak me, and my shoes didn't dry out that night, nor the
next.  Having said that, the wet shirt and shorts did manage to keep
me comfortably cool for the rest of the ride.</p>

<p>South of Barrie, I stopped in Bradford for a rest, gave Amy a call,
and went on South down Yonge.  It was getting a little hillier, and so
I tried to take it a little easier, stopping every now and then.  I
met a nice kid who was taking the bus to his job at Canada's
Wonderland.  He was hoping for a thunderstorm, so that he could sit
around and do nothing, and still get paid.  Heh.  He was also quite
impressed at my trip so far.  Finally, I saw the CN Tower.  What a
rush that was.  I worked out at one point that I could describe my
trip as "Go as far north as you can see.  Then look north again, and
go as far north as you can see.  Lather.  Rinse.  Repeat."  I never
did manage to keep track of how many times you would have to do that,
but it's sort of a neat idea.  Maybe next year.</p>
