I did it, I finished my first run!  I did the Scotiabank Toronto
Waterfront 5K in 42 minutes, doing
intervals of two minutes of walking and five minutes of running.
It was a good pace, fairly challenging but not so hard that I felt
like I wasn't going to make it.
</p>
<p>
It was cool to run in a real race, although there was a marked
difference between the 5K and the "real" races; we had little
kids, people with special needs, people who clearly intended to
amble the route (not that there's anything wrong with a nice
amble, but I'm not sure I'd choose Lakeshore for it).  There
was even a woman enjoying a nice, bracing cigarette before the
race began!  But hey, it was a good start and I'm really glad I
did it.

Five and ones have been kicking my ass lately and I don't know
why; the first couple of times were fine but ever since then
I have had that cruddy bronchitis feeling in my chest every time
I run.
</p>
<p>
For some reason I have been a complete slacker this week.  I ran
on Sunday, and I was going to run on Tuesday, Thursday, and
Saturday.  Then I didn't run on Tuesday because I was deathly
tired and felt kind of sick; so I planned to run on Wednesday
and Friday, and skip Saturday to rest up for my 5K on Sunday.
But on Wednesday we went to see a house in the evening; the
house was crap so I was grumpy and just felt like sitting on
the couch eating, so that's what I did.
</p>
<p>
So now it's Thursday and I just got back from a rather half-hearted
2.2K run, complete with that bronchitis feeling, but hey, at least
I ran.  I will run 2K on Saturday and go to bed early so I am nice
and fresh for the 5K on Sunday.
</p>
<p>
I have to say, if this were a 5K run instead of a 5K run/walk I
would totally not be ready.  I have never run 5K; I have never
even run 4K -- we supposedly did a 4K run in the clinic last week,
but really everyone stopped running after 3.5K and walked the 
rest of the way.  Fortunately it <em>is</em> a run/walk, so I will do
five and twos and do my damnedest to keep up that pace for the
full 5K.  And <em>next</em> time I do a 5K I will do it at
ten and ones, so there.

This post started as a response to Jillian's comment in my last post;
my response started getting really long so I figured I would post it
instead.
</p>
<p>
Here's what Jill said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fives and ones. I am in awe. I'm still doing twos and ones. 
Although perhaps that's because I live in the boonies and drive everywhere.
</p>
<p>
Someday I'll get an interval timer so I don't have to look at 
my watch every three steps. That might speed me up a little.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hey, two and ones are better than, say, the none and nones I was 
doing before this!  I have been increasing my running time every 
week or so fairly religiously.  I talked with Blake about it and he 
agreed that there's no point in waiting until one time becomes 
"easy" before moving up.  I mean, I guess it gets easi<em>er</em>
but never what I would call easy.  But then somehow the next step
up isn't all that much harder, and lo and behold here I am at
five and ones without ever feeling that I have over-exerted myself.
It's kind of weird, really.
</p>
<p>
Having a good timer must help a lot.  I am going to buy myself 
one of those cute little pink and purple Timex running watches as a 
reward for completing the 5K, I think (with my Running Room clinic 
coupon).  Right now I am using a hundred-year-old watch borrowed 
from Blake which only does one interval per set, so if I want to 
do five and ones I set it for six minutes, watch it obsessively 
for the first minute while I walk, and then run until it beeps.  
It does the trick for now, but it is neither pink and purple nor
cute.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
Some opportunistic bacteria have taken advantage of my allergically 
stuffed-up sinuses and set up residence there so now I have added sore teeth
and joint pain and general all-over misery to my existing repertoire
of sneezing and stuffiness, ironically just in time for the ragweed
pollen count to go down.  What this has to do with running is that
I skipped my run last night, which wouldn't be so bad except I 
skipped my run on Sunday too, due to being lazy and full after a
big family dinner.  So now I have skipped two runs in a row and I
am beginning to get annoyed with myself.  I should really have gone
out on Sunday; perhaps even eaten less so I wouldn't have been
so lethargic!  Now there's an idea.
</p>
<p>
I was having a look at the 
<a href="http://www.torontowaterfrontmarathon.com/en/images/stwmmarmap_big.jpg">map</a>
for the marathon I am not running on the 24th.  Notice how the 5K isn't
even shown on the map?  That's because the resolution of the map isn't
high enough to show the itty-bitty 5K route.  Damn, marathons are 
<em>long</em>!
I know, news at eleven, but look at that thing!  These people are running
all the way out to the Beaches, oh, but that's not far enough so on the way,
let's run <em>all the way down Leslie Spit</em> and back, and oh hey, that's
<em>still</em> not far enough, we have to double back all the way through 
downtown, past Roncesvalles, past High Park, to.. I don't even
know where that is!  Etobicoke?  Someplace I never go!  AND THEN
BACK DOWNTOWN!
</p>
<p>
Marathons are long, dude.

I have allergies, killer ragweed allergies.  I never used to be
allergic to anything until a couple of years ago.  I think I will
blame the children.  I can blame Cordelia, this year, for preventing
me from taking anything; we are still nursing and there isn't much
you're allowed to take.  So I walk around with a head full of 
cement all day and use a nasal decongestant spray at night so
I can sleep.  This sucks.  Apparently ragweed season goes until
November.  That sucks too.
</p>
<p>
In other news, we are poking at the idea of moving.  More than
poking, actually; we are submitting our mortgage application today
to find out how much house we can afford.  I hope we will have a
new place by Christmas, although we're not on any sort of a 
deadline so we can take as much time as we need to find a good
house.
</p>
<p>
So I'm packing up and getting rid of things and making lists
and all those sorts of things that people do, and that's mostly
why I am not posting here very much; if I have time to blog then
I have time to pack a box or two, so I do that instead.  Which I
should go do now...

Cordelia's walking.  Just a few steps at a time, and she would rather
crawl if she's in a hurry, but she's definitely walking, in her
eleventh month.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise not much is going on (surely that's enough?).  She is
cute and funny and if you make kissy noises while you are holding
her she will dive bomb your face with mouth wide open for a big
sloppy kiss.  She still has two naps a day, although they are
getting shorter and more fitful and I expect she will move to
one nap fairly soon.  She sleeps from six fifteen or so in the
evening until six in the morning. Except for the other day; the
other day she slept until seven and I literally went into her
room to make sure she wasn't dead.  (She wasn't.)
</p>
<p>
And in a couple of weeks we will be having a birthday celebration!  
Mostly I am really excited because it means we can
give her egg; her not eating egg makes it seem like every interesting
food in the world has egg in it.  Pancakes!  Muffins!  Scrambled...
well... egg!
</p>
<p>
She has an uncanny ability to find any unguarded toilet and play with
it.  I am almost tempted to thoroughly clean one of the toilets and
just assign it to her.  
And she just spread the contents of one box of toys over three
rooms-worth of floor.  And I wonder why I have a bad back.  She's
trouble, this one.  But cute.

I feel like I haven't updated for ages, but it has only been 
a couple of weeks.  But what did I read?  I was working on
<em>A Son of the Circus</em> by John Irving for a while,
but I got stuck on it.  I think I am trying too hard to look for 
symbolism and subtext and stuff and not just blasting through
the story like I usually do.  Or else it's just not very
interesting, I am not sure which.  I'll get back to it
sometime.
</p>
<p>
After I gave up on that I read <strong><em>Bloodletting And
Miraculous Cures</em> by Vincent Lam</strong>, a collection
of connected stories about a group of medical students in Toronto.
I quite enjoyed these stories; Lam is an effective writer
with a nice turn of phrase, and I enjoyed getting a glimpse
into the lives of medical students and doctors.  (Lam is
a Toronto doctor as well as a writer.)
</p>
<p>
And I feel like I must have read some more but I guess blocking
on the Irving book just felt like reading a lot. 
</p>
<p>
I am trying to work on keeping notes when I read but mostly I
forget to do it.  I am not sure how to take notes when I
read fiction; what should I write down?  I think I will try
noting when I think something is an image or a metaphor, and 
then go back and try and figure out what it means later.  
With non-fiction I really need to make a note at the end
of each chapter on what the chapter was about.  I recently 
recommended a book to a friend; she ended up hating it but
it has been so long since I read it that I can barely remember
what I liked about it.  So I just had to nod; "yeah, book
sucks.  Right."

Still running...  I am up to five minutes of running and one minute
of walking, and it's easier than I thought it would be.  My friend
Michelle said that, physically, it never got harder for her than
one and ones, which is heartening. And I have to say I agree,
so far.  Running five minutes isn't particularly harder than running
four minutes, which wasn't much worse than running three minutes...
In fact, I rather enjoy five and ones because five minutes is long
enough to really get into the running part.  With shorter intervals
I found I spent a lot of time wondering if it was almost time to
stop running yet, but you can't really do that for five minutes,
so instead you think about other things, houses and school and
work and life, and then when the beeper beeps telling you to walk
it comes as a pleasant surprise rather than something you have
been obsessing about for the last minute and a half.
</p>
<p>
The 5K run (I hate to call it a "race" since I am not running
for speed, just completion) that I signed up for is on the
24th.  So far the farthest I have run is 3.75 K, but I am not
too worried about going 5K.  I will try and run it (with walking
breaks) and if I can't manage it I will walk it in.  No harm done.
</p>
<p>
The Learn To Run clinic I am taking is getting a little lamer; 
there was one really cool girl who dropped out two weeks ago, 
and now the only people I want to talk to are really fast, so
I am stuck at the back running with boring, annoying people who 
act like they are
doing me a favour running slow with me.  I think it's actually harder
to run with someone boring than to just go by myself.  To add
insult to injury,
the instructor seems to think that I need lots of encouragement
and chivvying along; "How are you doing?  Are you okay?  You can
walk if it's too hard."  Just because I am fat doesn't mean I am
out of shape, lady, I walk more in a day than most of you do in
a week;  I think everyone in the clinic drives there except me.
Ah well, I didn't get into this to make friends.

    <p>Okay, y'all know by now that we've got a new Mac.  And in the grand
tradition of new computers, I'm trying to burn up all the hard drive
space with fun or useful utilities.  Since this is pretty much my
first exposure to OSX, anything goes, since I probably haven't heard
of it.</p>

<p>Having said that, here's what I have found:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">QuickSilver</a></li>
<li>I installed <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a>, but I don't
think anything is using it, other than <a href="http://transmission.m0k.org/">Transmission</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a>
(Freeware, from the people who make <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml">BBEdit</a>)
is surprisingly my editor of choice.  (Well, except for this post.)  I
was sure I'ld stick with vim, being old-skool like that, but I find I
want to save my Terminal window for running things, and edit my source
in an editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and the two neat new tricks I've learned so far are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Command-Shift-4, then the spacebar to take a screenshot of
just one window, and</li>
<li>
<pre>sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowText -string "My Funny Message!!!"</pre>
to print a message on the login window.</li>

    <p>In a <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/09/05/What-Ruby-Needs">recent weblog entry</a>, Tim Bray wrote about some things he thought
Ruby lacked.  Since he doesn't have comments enabled, I thought I
would share my opinions here, as a series of disjointed thoughts.</p>

<p>He said "Ruby needs an IDE.  All programming languages need IDEs."
Well, I completely agree with that, and for my serious Python
programming (as opposed to noodling around in Python), I tend to use
Eclipse, because it's there.  Perhaps Ruby could take the same
approach...</p>

<p>Of course, he also said a couple of things where I think he's a
little off the mark.  For instance "I should never have to scroll
much; IDEs go to a lot of trouble to make it trivial to jump from
wherever to the source for the method being called, or its docs, or
the next compile error or breakpoint, or variable declaration, or
whatever. Scrolling back and forth in a source-code file is just
stupid."  This I see more as a problem with his choice of editor, or
perhaps his knowledge of its features.  I'm fairly sure both emacs and
vi allow you to jump to the things he's asking for...</p>

<p>"certain aspects of Unicode are, on the surface at least,
objectively racist; for example, why does UTF-8 encoding of characters
become progressively less efficient as you move from the languages of
the Western hemisphere to those of the East?"  Hmm...  I don't know...
My first guess would be because Western languages have approximately a
10,000th the number of characters as Eastern languages.  My second
guess would have something to do with Huffman coding and the
prevalence of Western Language (mainly English) documents on the net,
but I do recognize that this could be due to my only being able to
read English.</p>

<p>As for Integration, isn't that what Parrot, .NET, and the JVM are
supposed to provide us?  If I'm wrong, and the language level is the
appropriate level to solve this problem, then I sincerely hope that
it's the Ruby and Python communities who get together to do
something.</p>

<p>And finally, he missed what I consider to be the most important
part of an IDE.  (No, not Source Control Integration!)  An integrated
debugger.  I had to go back to print statements to figure out what was
happening in Demokritos recently, and it just sucked.  So I added in
some pdb support, and while it was easy to add the breakpoints, using
it also sucked.  Can we please show me the list of variables in a box
at the top of my screen, and more than zero lines of context around
the currently executing line?  Please?  It was so bad that I'm
actually going to install Eclipse on my Mac Mini, just to avoid it in
the future.</p>
