Since I last posted I have started making notes on the books I
read in an old-fashioned paper-and-pen notebook, which is part
of the reason I haven't posted about books; I feel like I've
thought about the books quite enough between reading them and
then making notes, I don't really want to face them again in
the blog.  So I am trying to decide if I should give up blogging
about books at all.  On the one hand I feel as if books are 
the only thing of substance I write about, and I sort of
like putting my reading list out there and sharing the finds
and the books to avoid; I know there is at
least one person who gets ideas about books to read from my
list.  On the other hand I
don't know if anyone else particularly cares what I read and
what I think about it, so maybe it's not worth blogging about
and I should stick to the paper book log.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, all that aside I would like to write about what I
read in the rest of 2006, for completeness.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Baby Project</em> by Sarah Ellis</strong> is a
young adult novel about a teenage girl who gets an unexpected
baby sister, and how the new addition pulls the family apart 
and together. 
</p>
<p>
SPOILER: Of course there is the obligatory 
tragedy which forces everyone to confront their demons and
become better people. Tragedies in young adult fiction often
seem to heavy-handed and morose and obvious.  "We must
have something terrible happen to these people to move the
character development forward."  As opposed to the tragedy
happening because tragedies happen, which I suppose happens
in life, but I feel like fiction should be a little more sensible.  
I don't know how an
author finesses that fine line of having things happen to move
the novel forward without it being obvious that <em>this thing
is happening to move the novel forward</em>, but it's nice when they manage
it.  Which Ellis didn't here, but otherwise it's a good story
with well-drawn characters.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Reading Series Fiction</em> by Victor Watson</strong>
seemed like a nice complement to the book about reading like a professor.
It's about series fiction for children, which apparently is an
under-studied genre in the world of children's literature.  Watson
gives a nice overview, with lots of analysis of various series, 
as well as effectively skewering Enid Blyton.  This is a must-read
for anyone who is interested in children's literature.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Confessions of an Organized Homemaker</em> by Deniece 
Schofield</strong> is a book about how to get organized.  I can't
remember the layout or concept of this book, but I wrote down a 
bunch of good ideas from it, like keeping jigsaw puzzle pieces
in big Ziploc baggies and getting rid of the boxes (which always
fall apart, don't stack nicely and generally make life hard); keeping
all dry ingredients (flour, baking soda, rice, etc) in Tupperware 
containers which stack neatly, rather than in the original packaging
(of course I use cheap and cheerful Gladware instead).  
This was a useful book with lots of similar good ideas.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Johnny Kellock Died Today</em> by Hadley Dyer</strong>
is a young adult novel set in Halifax in the fifties.  I don't remember
much about this apart from a favourable impression and appealing
characters, and another tragedy but a much more finely drawn and
subtle one.  
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Stumbling on Happiness</em> by Daniel Gilbert</strong>
is a book about what makes people happy.  This is very nicely
written; I enjoyed reading it not just for the content but
for the author's voice.  It's an interesting book about
where happiness comes from, what makes us happy, how we deal with
tragedy, and how to make decisions that will make us happy in
the future.    It's probably a good idea for everyone to read this
book.  Everyone who wants to be happy, anyway.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Car and the City</em> by Alan Thein Durning</strong>
is an overview of how cars and cities work together, or rather
how they don't work together, and how we can create cities which
improve our lives and lessen our dependence on cars (which are
pretty much synonymous in  my mind).  Useful book, easy to read.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Children of Green Knowe</em> by Lucy Boston</strong> and
<strong><em>Autumn Term</em> by Antonia Foster</strong> are both discussed
in the aforementioned <em>Reading Series Fiction</em> book.  <em>Green
Knowe</em> is about a little boy who is sent to live with an ancient
relative in a spooky old house, and the friends he makes there; 
<em>Autumn Term</em> is an excellent representative of the English
Boarding School genre.  Both are very good and I will suggest the
girls read them when they are older.
</p>
<p>
I did not finish
<em>Allergy: History of a Modern Malady</em> by Mark Jackson.  I thought
it would be more chatty, more lighthearted, but it turned out to be a 
dense discussion of the history of allergies in medicine, and I gave up
after a couple of chapters.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Blue Shoes and Happiness</em> by Alexander McCall Smith</strong>
and <strong><em>Cold Moon</em> by Jeffrey Deaver</strong> were good
easy reading.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The March of Unreason: Science, Democracy and the New
Fundamentalism</em> by Dick Taverne</strong> is a really nice comparison
of anti-scientific doctrines and beliefs with the old religious
fundamentalism. Taverne discusses the role of the media and 
post-modernist thought in the mongering of fear of such diverse
bugaboos as multinational companies, pesticide, genetic modification,
and modern medicine.  His arguments are sound and this book is very
thought-provoking.  It's also nice to think that one doesn't have to
go around being scared and cynical all the time.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Kindred</em> by Octavia Butler</strong> is an awesome 
book.  It's about a modern (well, seventies) black woman who is
sent back in time to the slavery-era South to save a white man who
will become her ancestor.  Imagine the best possible book with that
scenario, and that's what Butler has written.  I am glad to have 
found this author because she wrote a lot, and you know I am always
running out of things to read.  
</p>
<p>
I didn't read <strong><em>Blink</em> by Malcolm Gladwell</strong> because
I wanted to, but because every else in the world has read it and I
felt left out.  I'm glad I did, though, because it's interesting and
Gladwell is always a pleasure to read.  It's more of that same brain
stuff like in <em>Stumbling on Happiness</em> and <em>The Paradox
of Choice</em>, and the more I know about how the brain works
the more in control I feel, and the more I understand about the
world.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Fourth Horseman</em> by Andrew Nikiforuk</strong> was
really disappointing.  It's a book about plagues and pandemics, and I
love a good plague.  One of my favourite units in History was on
the Black Death.  But in my notebook I wrote "A discussion of various
plagues and pandemics through the ages, fatally marred by the author's
disdain for doctors, technology, and facts."  It's a weird book;
at one point Nikiforuk talks with disgust about how underwear was
originally worn to protect more valuable outer garments from body
soil.  Isn't that why we wear underwear now?  I mean, except
Paris Hilton, for whom outerwear <em>is</em> underwear.  He also
goes into a wistful reverie about the good old days when half of
children born didn't make it to age five, and old people were 
really respected because there weren't so many of them.  He speaks with
disdain about the "germ theory" of disease, the radical theory
that microorganisms are the cause of many diseases.  And a cornerstone of
modern medicine.  I think Nikiforuk is a kook in journalist's 
clothing; this book was a jarring contrast the <em>The March of
Unreason</em>.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Little People: Learning to See The World Through My 
Daughter's Eyes</em> by Dan Kennedy</strong> is a book by the father
of a little girl born with achondroplagic dwarfism, about his 
journey to understand why she was born different and what that
means for her future and for the world she will live in.  It was
an interesting book and a good read.  It was also fun to read the
bits about the Roloffs, because I know you watch <em>Little People,
Big World</em> every week like I do.  Or at least you should.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Break No Bones</em> by Kathy Reichs</strong> is better
than the last one â€” she's back to her usual formula and it's
working.  Although I hope she resolves this husband/boyfriend love
triangle thing, it's starting to drag on.
</p>
<p>
So that was a lot of books and it took me a really long time to
write about them; was it worth it?  I don't know; I'm just really
tired.

            <p class="byline author vcard"><span class="byline-name fn">Amy Brown</span></p>

        </div>

    <p>
Cordelia is my little monkey.  She is fearless and ambitious â€”
this morning she was hauling the cat carrier around the house,
dragging it behind her and bashing into every damn thing.  She
dragged it into the kitchen and before I could turn around she had
climbed on it and was messing around on the counter.  She
does appalling things like that every day; I certainly didn't
get any experience with this kind of behaviour from Delphine.
</p>
<p>
Last time I posted about Cordelia, she had just started
walking.  Well, she's been walking for four months now and
she's pretty darn good at it.  Mostly.  The other day I put
her down in  the front yard and she took off like a flash down
the path; there's a little step right before the path meets
the sidewalk, and she stepped down it.  Unfortunately the
step is about four inches, and Cordelia's leg is also about
four inches, and so after her foot made contact with the
ground, her right hand did, then her left, and then... her
head. She hardly cried at all, but I had to pick some grit
out of her, and now she's walking around with a gnarly big
scab on her forehead.  She doesn't care; it makes her
look fierce.
</p>
<p>
She says a few words now: cat, up, milk, ball, book, 
Mimi (which applies to all cats), Daddy, Mummy, duck, 
and of course, "no", with a
little head shake.
She always says "no" when you ask her a question;
I think she just likes shaking her head.  She had her
eye on my tea â€” the child is always thirsty â€” and asked 
for it, but then answered her own question by shaking
her head sadly: "no".
</p>
<p>
Fifteen months is the age Delphine was when we started
putting her down to sleep alone; Cordelia has been sleeping
alone for almost a year.  She sleeps from six or six-thirty
until six in the morning, and she goes down without a
fight.  Last night I was nursing her to sleep and she 
stopped nursing and looked around.  I issued my usual
ultimatum: "Boobie or bed!"  Her typical response is
to latch right back on in a hurry, but last night she
said "Bed!", and sat up to be put in the crib.
</p>
<p>
She's down to one nap a day, mostly â€” she just suddenly
stopped needing a morning nap one day.  The catch is
that when she's sick she still needs two naps some days,
and I'm never sure whether any given day will be a one-napper or
a two-napper.  Makes planning ahead hard.
</p>
<p>
Being in the house with Cordelia is also really hard; if I
want to go upstairs or to the basement, I have to pick her
up; I can't work in the basement with her because there
are too many hazards: cat litter, stairs, unexpected pointy
things.  Upstairs we don't have a baby gate for stairs, so 
I have to pick a room to work in, shut the door, and stay
there.  So mostly we stay on the main floor, which makes
unpacking and doing laundry and any other multifloor
pursuit very difficult.  I do miss having everything on the
same floor, but I have to remind myself that one day
Cordelia will be able to handle stairs and being by herself,
so I will be able to get stuff done much easier.
</p>
<p>
And in the meantime, she makes me laugh every single
day.

People keep asking me if we're getting settled in,
and until today I was getting pretty tired of it,
because I really didn't feel all that settled.
Today, though, we moved a bunch of boxes out of
the living room and laid down the rug, cleared
the upstairs landing, and unpacked a couple of
big bins, and now it finally does feel like we're
getting settled, like this is really where we 
live and not just where all our stuff is.
</p>
<p>
Of course we still have a million things to
unpack, but we have been cleverly hiding boxes
in the basement rather than face them, and we
are managing quite nicely with the forty 
percent of our possessions that we have unpacked.
I have a grand plan for unpacking the rest 
which involves a large box labelled "Garage
Sale"; Blake and I will dig into that project
in the New Year.
</p>
<p>
It's a crappy little house (in some ways, and
in others it's wonderful), and sometimes I 
wonder why we bought it.  The kitchen needs 
redoing, the bathroom needs redoing (not to
mention there's only the one), the basement
isn't done at all... this house is a money sponge
capable of absorbing every spare
penny for the next two decades.  Why didn't we
buy one of the shiny, renovated perfect houses
with the dug-out, finished basements and the
second bathrooms and the nice kitchens?  
</p>
<p>
Money, for one thing; we didn't pay much for
this place.  But we're going to have to put more
than the difference back into it to get it up
to snuff.  The burning desire to be knee-deep
in plaster dust for the next five years?  A
passion to express myself through interior
design?  That can't be right.
</p>
<p>
I don't think that's the reason we bought
the house.
I think we fell in love with the
oldness of it, with the perfect trim and the
retro cabinets, and with the challenge of
taking this beloved old house and bringing it
up to date without erasing its character; 
deciding what to keep and what to take away.
Taking what is in a sense a blank slate and
making it our own.
</p>
<p>
We've got some pretty good ideas about keeping
the character while still beating the house
into twenty-first century submission.  We're
going to rip down a bunch of walls, but save
the trim and cleverly use it elsewhere:  we're
going to use the trim from between the living
room and the dining room to frame a huge
pass-through between the kitchen and the dining
room; we're going to use trim from one of the
doors to create an archway at the end of the
new front hall; we're going to use two doors
to make a headboard, and another to make a mirror
for the top of the stairs.  We're going to 
salvage the doorknobs and line them up on a
board to hang coats and hats on.  We're going
to patch the floors rather than refinish
(or replace) the hardwood.  And of course
I want to do the kitchen in a style reminiscent
of the fifties; I almost want the kitchen to 
look like it was installed in the fifties
and impeccably maintained, rather than to
look like a new kitchen with all the latest
fashions and gadgets.
</p>
<p>
I think when we're done this first phase of
renovations, the house will be modern and
comfortable, with an open living space, lots
of light and air, a large, usable kitchen,
and new wiring and light switches in sensible
places, but it will still retain the patina of
age that we love.

Delphine might be the only three and a half-year-old
in North America who has never seen an entire movie.
This week her Auntie Morgan tried to get her to watch
<em>Finding Nemo</em> but it was too scary for her.
I don't know if they made it all the way to the end,
but they definitely skipped some bits in the middle.
</p>
<p>
Delphine is still on the delicate side of the 
sensitivity scale; she is reserved with new people,
and she doesn't like scary or violent characters
in movies or TV shows.  Books don't bother her so
much; we read her Little Red Riding Hood and Chicken
Little, and she doesn't flinch at the devouring of
grandmothers or the biting off of heads.
</p>
<p>
Once she gets past her initial reservations
she rises to the occasion.  At Hanukkah dinner she
made conversation with Baba's friends, and just last
night she very bravely petted a large, friendly dog.
She can even put her face in the pool for three
seconds!
As long as she gets lots of cuddles and patience she
faces her fears admirably.
</p>
<p>
She is very solicitous of others and loves to be
the mummy.  When I am scared of something, (or pretend
to be) she comes up and pats me and says "It's okay
Mummy, I will protect you."  She has lots of baby
dollies, and she takes great care of them, feeding
them and putting them down for naps.  We all
have to be quiet when they are taking a nap.
</p>
<p>
She gets into these weird proto-Goth funks sometimes,
where she goes all nihilistic:  "I don't want any
toys, I don't want you, I don't want anyfing!  Go
away Mummy!  I want to be sad!"  And then she has
a big cry.  It's almost like she's picking at a
scab, emotionally, like she wants to experience
the pain of sorrow in an environment she has 
created and controls.  I'm never sure what to do
but mostly I let her go through it and just 
stay around to administer cuddles when she's ready
for them.
</p>
<p>
Delphine loves puzzles and
accordingly got a whole pile of them for Christmas.
She's fairly good at them; she needs a little help
the first time through, but  she can usually
do them on her own thereafter.  I am looking forward
to when she's older and we can all do jigsaw
puzzles together properly.  For now they all have to be
done high up on the dining table, out of the reach
of Cordelia the Marauder.
</p>
<p>
Delphine likes sticking stickers, which is like
drawing only not creative.  And she spent literally
hours playing with a pair of paper dress-up dolls
my cousin sent her â€” you know, the ones with
the clothes with little tabs on them?  The old toys
are still the best.
</p>
<p>
Delphine's getting better at reasoning, which means we
have to have airtight reasons when we tell her to
do (or not do) things.  This morning she asked for
a lollipop; I said she shouldn't have candy in the
morning, but somehow she knew I had already had a
cookie.  She reasoned that a cookie
is a treat, and a lollipop is a treat, so she should
be allowed to have a lollipop.  I couldn't really 
argue with that without getting into subtle, and
frankly dubious, arguments like the presence of flour
and egg in cookies rendering them slightly closer
to actual food.  So she got her lollipop.
</p>
<p>
The lollipops, incidentally, were also a gift from my 
cousin.  They are little jellies in the shapes of
Santa and snowmen and stuff, on a lollipop stick.
Delphine is not a chewer of candies, so she sucks
these little jellies and makes them last literally
for hours, which of course drives Cordelia mad 
because she's not allowed to have jelly lollipops
at all.
</p>
<p>
Three and a half is great.  It's a little psychotic
sometimes, but (just like all the other ages) often
because she's tired or hungry.  And mostly it's great;
she can talk, she can think, she can go up and down
stairs by herself, she has friends and ideas and 
opinions.  She's a real person, and I quite like her.

Today I ran for the first time in a month and a half.
I  signed up for the Resolution Run 5K on December
31 in an attempt to motivate myself to keep running
through the winter, but I didn't count on the move
joining forces with the cold weather to put me off
lacing up my sneakers.
</p>
<p>
So between cleaning and packing and moving and
unpacking and being busy and exhausted, I haven't
been running.  It seems there are things I give 
up on when I am very busy, and things I don't;
the things I give up on are exercise, reading,
baking and cooking complicated meals.  The things
I don't give up on are watching TV, sleeping,
flossing, going to choir practice and seeing 
friends.  And eating â€” I hear there are
people who get so busy they forget to eat, but
that's never been an issue for me.
</p>
<p>
I did, finally, go for a run today.  After the
collosal binge that is Christmas Day I was 
desperate to do something healthy, and I thought
I should test the waters to see how well I can 
expect to do at the Resolution Run on the 31st.
I did 2K today, and I didn't die; I made it through
the first ten minutes okay, although I started too
fast and almost wore myself out.  I had to take a
walk break in the second ten minutes, but only for 
half a block.  I think I should be fine in the
Run if I do five and ones or seven and ones.
</p>
<p>
Now that we are getting settled in and it's no
longer imperative to spend every spare moment
unpacking, I am going to try and go out for two 
2Ks and one 5K every week.

We made it in, and back on the internet in record time (after the
cable dude drilled a hole in our wall.  All the way through our wall.
With a really long drill bit.)
</p>
<p>
Moving day went pretty smoothly, all in all.   It took way longer than
I thought it would to move us over; we have a lot of stuff, which is
funny because I hate stuff.  I guess I don't hate it all that much.
We weren't all moved until seven at night, and then we had a minor
crisis because I wasn't smart enough to set aside pyjamas and toothbrushes
and stuff, so we had to go digging through boxes before the girls 
could go to be.  In fact they both went to bed in regular clothes
because I gave up on their pyjamas.
</p>
<p>
Today Blake and I and Morgan worked hard building furniture and
unpacking, and the place
still looks like hell but we did manage to sit on our actual sofa
and watch some actual TV this evening, and isn't that what it's all
about?  
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow the plumber comes to install our 
<a href="http://www.clawfootsupply.com/product463">shower converter thing</a>
(not that exact one but something similar) and our 
<a href="http://www.clawfootsupply.com/product906">super sexy
bridge faucet</a> (that exact one, I believe, although we didn't buy
it from that supplier).  Also the couch dudes come back to reassemble
the huge couch in Cordelia's room, and then I think that's all for
people coming to fix stuff.  For a while, anyway.
</p>
<p>
I kind of love my little house.  I knew I would.  It seems to be
holding all our stuff fairly well, even without buying new furniture
and installing clever storage solutions and, you know, adding fifteen 
feet to the back.  Although I am still trying to figure
out how previous owners have managed without any kind of coat
closet.  I love the Deco fixtures, I love how it gets warm really
quickly and stays that way (because it doesn't have a wall of
eight-foot windows in every room), I love the neighbours, I love
having rooms for the girls. 
</p>
<p>
We are still getting used to the new noises. The floors upstairs
are so creaky that our ten pound cat sets them off;  last night
poor Blake kept getting up because he thought Delphine was coming
down the hall, but no, it was just Thomas.  Tonight Blake and
I spent some time figuring out the source of a weird pinging noise;
turns out a floor joist in the dining room is attached to a duct,
and every time you step in it it flexes the duct enough to make
it ping.  And now we think we can hear the neighbour's television.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow is Monday; Blake is off work and Delphine is in daycare,
so hopefully we can get a good pile of stuff done.  Hooray!

Tomorrow we move.  We move from a spacious tenth-floor condo to a 
tiny earth-bound house.  We move from the longest street in the
world to a tiny block in a sweet, domestic, leafy neighbourhood.
From sky to ground, from noise to quiet, from city to... well, 
what used to be suburb, eighty years ago.
</p>
<p>
Everything is pretty well packed, apart from the stuff we will need
today and tomorrow morning, and Delphine's toys which we left out
to keep everything as normal as possible for her.  We signed all the 
legal papers yesterday, and we should get our new house keys today.
</p>
<p>
The new house is going to be an adventure, perhaps more of an 
adventure than you necessarily want your primary residence to be.
Between the no shower and the no dishwasher and the ancient stove...
well, as my real estate agent keeps telling me encouragingly,
"it will be like being at the cottage!"  Without the beach
and the ice cream stand.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, yesterday I learned that "So are you all packed yet?!"
is the "Still pregnant?!" of moving, and equally annoying and 
unhelpful.  "No!  Piss off!"
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
We're going to be offline for a couple of days; cable will shut down
tomorrow and the cable guy isn't coming to set it up at the new place
until Sunday morning.  And I am frankly a little skeptical that he
will be able to get it working; I don't think the cable company 
appreciates the depth and breadth of the non-cable-having-ness of
the new house.  (No cable.  Ever.)  We'll see.  
Anyway, the website will be down and
we won't be getting email, so if you want to contact us you'll have
to phone, except the phone will be shut off on Saturday morning.
So you'll have to visit.  We'll be somewhere on Davisville.
</p>
<p>
See you in the new house!

Delphine, being only three and a half, still has lots of those
little kid speech peculiarities which are so adorable that parents
insist on talking about them for years, and even try and teach
them to their grandchildren (ask Blake's father about "meemor" 
and "monsert" some time.  Or don't.)
</p>
<p>
Delphine's most distinctive one is switching consonant sounds
within words, for example "bastick" for "basket", or "bistick"
for "biscuit".  Our doctor's name is Dr Paquette, and Delphine
calls her "Dr Pateck".  Since she also has trouble with the
word "protect" she decided that Dr Pateck is called that because
she patecks us.
</p>
<h4>Delphine Tells A Joke</h4>
<p>
Yesterday Delphine received her first issue of the magazine <em>Chirp</em>,
which is targetted to three- to seven-year-olds.  That's a pretty big
range, so a lot of the magazine is over her head, including the page of
jokes at the end.  I read a couple of riddles to her, but she remained
characteristically stone-faced; however when I read her the knock-knock
joke she laughed.  Encouraged, I read it a couple more times, and then we 
practiced doing it properly, with me taking the lead:
</p>
<p>
"Knock knock!"<br>
"Who's there?"<br>
"Anita!"<br>
"Anita who?"<br>
"Anita cup of hot chocolate!"<br>
Peals of laughter from Delphine.
</p>
<p>
So I thought I would get her to go and tell Daddy the joke as a
surprise.  I coached her a little bit, and sent her off.  
</p>
<p>
Here's
how it went:
"Knock knock!  Who's there?  Daddy!  Daddy who?  Daddy cup of hot
chocolate!"  And she laughed and laughed, and Blake was bewildered.
Still funny, but not in quite the same way.

(Michelle, you should maybe skip this post in light of our conversation
re: passing out during an episode of ER.)
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, as I was shuffling, shoeless about the house (as usual) I stabbed
my foot on a splinter.  Crap, I thought, that hurts; but I was in the middle
of preparing supper for the girls so I carried on, and in a lull in the
cooking I got my tweezers and tried to pull the splinter out so I
could get on with my evening.
</p>
<p>
The splinter didn't come out; I couldn't get a good grip on it with
my shiny red Tweezerman slanted tweezers while I was hopping around
on one foot, so I brought a dining room chair into the kitchen 
(where the light is best) and sat down.
</p>
<p>
Once, twice, three times I pulled and somehow always lost my grip on
the splinter before I got it out.  Finally I really dug those pointy
Tweezerman corners into my foot, pinched the splinter as tight as I
could and pulled hard.  
</p>
<p>
To my horror what I had thought was a little sliver
turned out to be an inch-long spear of hardwood floor.  I immediately 
started 
bleeding all over the floor, great big bright red drops, so I grabbed 
a tea towel off the stove
(there's a good reason to make sure you get a fresh tea towel out
every day; if you injure yourself at least you know there's at most
a day worth of crap on the first towel that comes to hand) and applied
pressure with one hand while calling for backup with the
other.  Fortunately Zaida was only a couple of minutes away so 
he came right over to help with the girls' supper while I bandaged
myself up and cleaned the kitchen floor.
</p>
<p>
That was yesterday.
</p>
<p>
Last Tuesday, I woke up in the middle of the night with the most
excruciating pain I had ever had (although bear in mind I didn't
go through labour, so this could be nothing compared to that).
It felt like someone was punching me all over my chest and back.  It
went on for ten or fifteen minutes and was gone as soon as it had
come.  It came again on Thursday morning (there's just something
especially cool about lying on the floor in agony while your three-year-old
tries to figure out what to do with herself -- Mummies aren't supposed
to get sick!) so on Friday I went to the doctor.  She thinks I
might have gallstones, so I am getting an ultrasound this Friday to
check it out.
</p>
<p>
While I was at the doctor she informed me that those red bumps on my
belly which I thought were maybe bites or something are actually
shingles,
for which she gave me a prescription for a week's worth of blue
horse pills, anti-virals, and an exhortation to rest.  (I laughed,
and offered to let her come over and look after Cordelia and pack
while I rested.)
</p>
<p>
So to recap: gallstones, shingles, and a bloody great hole in the
bottom of my foot.  It made yesterday's application for life insurance
a barrel of fun, for sure.  Well, Blake laughed a lot anyway.
