                    <p>
It's been ages since I've updated, and a lot has changed, although
it seems like mostly in the last couple of day.
</p>
<p>
Delphine's a champion stander now; she easily pulls herself up on
whatever is around, and she will stand and play at a coffee table
or chair for ages.  She's even started experimenting with only 
holding on with one hand, and she  cruises from one piece of
furniture to another.
</p>
<p>
On the crawling front, though, she hasn't advanced much.  She can
get around pretty quickly, but she's still commando-crawling, and
hasn't discovered the superiority of the hands-and-knees technique.
I'm beginning to wonder if she won't bypass that stage altogether
and skip right to walking.
</p>
<p>
Much to my relief, she has finally discovered consonants; Friday
she figured out muh-muh-muh-muh, and by Sunday she had added
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba and da-da-da-da-da.  Soon she'll be writing sonnets.
</p>
<p>
She's eating lots of different foods now; fruits, vegetables, 
cereals, yogurt, cottage cheese and beans.  This week I'm going to 
give her tofu, and then we'll try actual dead animal.  The only 
thing that seems to stop her is chunks; she still likes things
well pureed, or else she has to make dealthy gagging sounds until
I rescue her from the killer peas!  In her mouth!  And then sometimes
she vomits.  I've learned my lesson.
</p>
<p>
She's cut her nursing way back; she doesn't nurse at all in the morning,
and sometimes we go all afternoon without nursing either.  She
still nurses in the evening and through the night.  The only thing
that settles her when she wakes overnight, in fact, is nursing.  
Sometimes I get tired of being the human pacifier, but it's not 
like she'll be a baby forever.
</p>
<p>
She's well and truly into the separation anxiety phase, apparently
right on time.  She doesn't even like it when her aunt or grandpa
hold her, and she never used to have a problem with them.  Now,
it's Mum or Dad or nobody.
</p>
<p>
We went to playgroup for the first time 
last Wednesday; it's a program with music,
games and crafts.  I signed us up as much for an activity for me
as anything.  I need something to break up the weeks or this
winter is going to last for years.  
</p>
<p>
I was really looking forward
to it, to learning some new songs and meeting other mothers, and
in that respect it was disappointing.  I didn't like some of
the new songs, and the ones she sung that I knew were kind of 
mangled: "hush-a, hush-a" in "Ring Around the Rosies" instead
of "a-tishoo, a-tishoo", and "all around the town" in "The
Wheels on the Bus" instead of "all the livelong day", not that
that makes any sense.  I know they're folk songs, and that's what
they do, change, but it seemed weird and wrong.  I'll get
over it.
</p>
<p>
The other mothers weren't so friendly; I felt like the new
girl all over again, trying to make eye contact and smile and
be friendly, and everyone seemed to avoid my eyes and close
off into their cliques.  It was quite weird.  I did end up
elbowing my way into a conversation or two, and I'm sure it 
will get better as the weeks go on.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
I've decided I'm going to stop worrying about whether I'm
doing things right. I kept second-guessing myself; should
I be feeding Del this, or that?  Should I try and make her
sleep in the crib?  Should I nurse her more?  Less?  Make
her nap longer?  How?  Hold her more often?  Less often?
Read to her?  Make her listen to classical music?  Describe
everything she sees, loudly, like some 
deranged docent?
</p>
<p>
Finally I realized that I'm a reasonably intelligent and 
emotionally stable and if I follow my instincts and listen
to my heart, I won't go far wrong.  I don't need her to
pass the RCM Grade 12 piano exam by the time she's eight,
or cure cancer or remedy world hunger.  All I want for her
is happiness, and right now that means sleeping with me and
eating bananas and going for walks.
</p>
<p>
She's pretty smart, too, and I'm sure she'll figure out how
to go to sleep by herself, and how to talk, and how to read,
without me shoving it all down her neck.

Another gastronomic breakthrough for Delphine today; we both
had the same thing for lunch, Habitant Pea Soup.  I thought it
was time to introduce Delphine to the lard food group.
</p>
<p>
She also had bananas, yogurt and rice cereal mashed up, for dessert.
I had cucumber sandwiches on thinly sliced, homemade oat bread with
a chutney and horseradish mayonnaise.  Sometimes I eat fancy.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
In other food news, I'm still trying to redeem my averages from
Christmas, and the post-Christmas leftover eating.  It doesn't
help that on Friday I had a three thousand calorie day.  The horrifying
thing is that it wasn't all that hard; pastry for breakfast, 
a jam sandwich as an afternoon snack, a grande mocha for a treat after
Blake got home, pizza and wings for supper and a half-cup of
frozen yogurt for dessert.  Any of those things alone would be
reasonable, but when you have them all in one day...  Well, three
thousand calories.
</p>
<p>
It makes me realize that I must have had a lot of three thousand
calorie days back when I wasn't paying attention.  Sort of
explains the 240 lb thing; genetics, my ass.
</p>
<p>
In an attempt to get my averages back in line, and also as an
experiment, I had a sixteen hundred  calorie day on 
Saturday.  Also, surprisingly, not that hard.  Toast and tea
for breakfast, hot and sour soup for lunch, another mocha 
(tall this time), and salad for supper, but a tasty salad
with facon and egg and cheese.  We even had dessert, custard
made with skim milk.  There's hope yet.

If I learned anything from 
<a href="http://www.celluloideyes.com/holidailies/">Holidailies</a> it
was that it takes a village to write an entry, or at least a household.
Each entry I wrote was a commitment of at least forty-five minutes,
and I'd need Blake to look after Delphine while I wrote it.  Most of
the entries I wrote after dinner, in the evening, when we would normally
be going to bed, and I think it shows.
</p>
<p>
Long story short, since apparently I don't even have time to write
a little weblog entry, I'm shutting down my other journal for the 
forseeable future (probably until Delphine and Little Number Two
are in grade school) and writing here instead.  (Later when I have
time I will put a note to that effect on the journal page.)  
I think it will be easier to write more often
with a weblog.  And hell, some of my

                    <p>Last night, as I (Blake) was holding Delphine, and letting her chew on
my finger, I noticed that it hurt a little more than usual.  When I
checked further, I felt the top of her first tooth!  I immediately
passed her to Amy, to double check, and we both agreed that there was
a tiny sharp something there.  I think it was the first time I've
noticed something new about Delphine, and I'm quite excited about it.
Amy claims that she even saw the tooth, but Del refused to let us get
a picture of it (sorry, Mom).  Every time something like this happens,
I realize a little more that she's not going to be the tiny perfect
baby that she currently is for the rest of her life.  She's growing
up, at a rather alarming rate, and I'm very excited to find out who
she'll be at various points.</p>

                    <p>It's 4:00 on the Friday before I leave for a week-long vacation,
and all of the management-types and sales people left the office an
hour or so ago.  And I'm so bored, it isn't even funny.  The online
forum I usually read isn't being entertaining enough, and I'm not even
getting deluged with email.</p>

<p>I suppose not doing anything isn't really a good reason to
complain, but dammit, I can feel my brain dissolving, and my will to
do anything slipping away.  And I'm not sure why, but I can't bring
myself to play a few rounds of <a href="http://www.diabloii.net/">Diablo II</a> to pass the time.  And
so I sit, and mindlessly surf the InterWeeb, and chat with whomever's
in the chat room, and wonder how long the construction people in the
office below us will be hammering on our floor.</p>

<p>Hmm.  Perhaps writing an entry about being bored isn't as exciting
as I thought it might be.  Time to switch the topic.  Amy and Delphine
and I are going to visit Amy's parents in Sasketchewan tomorrow
morning.  We'll be gone for a week, and it should be quite fun, since
Amy's parents haven't seen Delphine before.  (Well, they've seen
pictures, but that's hardly the same.)  It's tough to try and decide
what we're going to take, with the added constraint that most of the
stuff we use on a day-to-day basis just isn't going to fit in our
luggage.  (Stuff like the high chair, or the stroller, or the bed rail
that keeps her from falling out of our bed, or even the play mat that
she rolls around on.)  What are we going to do without all the
conveniences of home?  And where are we going to go to hang out in a
city that doesn't have a Starbucks or a Second Cup, or even a Tim
Hortons?  (There is a local coffee shop, but its non-smoking section
wasn't separately ventilated, and noticibly smelled of smoke the last
time we were there.  I don't consider myself a non-smoking Nazi, but I
really don't want my baby daughter exposed to a know carcinogen.  That
also brings up the problem of my mother-in-law smoking.  It's her
house, and I don't feel comfortable asking her to stop smoking, but I
also don't want Del to have to breath it in.  I'm not sure what I'm
going to do.  Hopefully Amy will have some ideas, or won't care, and
I'll take my cues from her.)</p>

<p>So yeah, I'll be without the internet for all next week.  That'll
be a bit of a change.  I can't imagine what I'll do.  Fortunately,
we'll be taking the laptop, so I might get the chance to write some
code on a new Palm program that I've been thinking of.  With any luck,
I'll still be able to blog while I'm out there.  Or, at least, store
up the blogs on my Palm for posting when I get back.  We'll see how
well it works.  And I think I'll stop there, because Columbine joined
chat, and he's usually interesting.</p>

going on.  Well, nothing other than the usual stuff.  I did replace the
server, since it was starting to show its age, and it's taken me a little
longer than I thought it might to get everything back up and running.  I
have also been spending my time setting up secure IMAP so that I can check
my home email from both home and work, and not miss stuff when I'm on one
computer or the other.  Really, I'm not even sure why I'm writing, other
than to get back in the habit.  I'm reading a lot of <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/comments/tech/dynamic_polling_freq_too">
weblogs</a>, and even commenting in some of them.  I suppose that's the
real reason I'm writing this.  To give the backlinks somewhere to point
to.</p>

                    <p>Well, I've been out of the loop for a while.  In my defense, my
wife had <a href="http://baby.latte.ca/">our first baby</a>, and I
took a month off to help her.  You might think that I would have a lot
of free time to update this poor weblog, but that's really not the way
babies work.  Even though taking care of a baby only takes a couple of
hours per day, it's broken up into 5-minute blocks, occurring right in
the middle of any task you wanted to try and perform, <a href="http://baby.latte.ca/pics/2003/0512/03-w-burping.jpg"><img src="http://baby.latte.ca/pics/2003/0512/03-t-burping.jpg" align="right"></a> and so you end up only being able to do one or two
things (if you're lucky!) all day.  So I didn't get to work on the
couple of programming projects I've been thinking about, and the house
fell into a minor state of disrepair, and basically Amy and I didn't
do much other than sit around and watch some <i>Sex And The City</i>
dvds we borrowed from a friend.  Well, we tried to get out of the
house at least once a day, so that we didn't go stir-crazy.</p>

<p>In other news, I biked to work today.  It went pretty well.  If you
get a copy of the <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/cycling/pdf/map6.pdf">Toronto Cycling
Map</a>, you can follow my path from Mount Pleasant Cemetery, down
through Moore Park Ravine, pas the Don Valley Brick Works, out and
down to Castle Frank station (I took a wrong turn on Elm), over to
Sherbourne street, and down Sherbourne to King Street (on the <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/cycling/pdf/map10.pdf">next map</a>), and
finally along King to the big number 37.  It was a fairly nice ride,
but I think that the next time I try it, I'm going to stick to the
roads all the way down.  The trail through the ravine was steep and
muddy in parts.  I had to walk halfway up a hill to get out of the
ravine, and I think I swallowed a bug.  It was nice and shady, but I
think that as long as I can get going at a reasonable speed, the wind
will cool me off just as well.</p>

<p>Update: I took the streets going back home, and it took 2/3 the
time despite being mainly uphill.  (I went up Sherbourne, along Glen,
over Summerhill to Welland and then back through the cemetary.  The
route is composed entirely of bike lanes and side streets, and after I
got north of Bloor, I think I only saw about 8 cars in total.  Well,
until I got to Moore.  Crossing Moore was a bit of an adventure, due
to the volume of cars coming from the other direction.)  All in all,
it was a really fun ride, and I think that will be the route I take
when I next bike to work.</p>

                    <p>Well, the header on this page says "Thoughts from the Brown-Winton
household".  I suppose a loose interpretation of that would be that any and
all info on this site is being broadcast from a server at said
"Brown-Winton household".  With that in mind, lets consider me the roving
reporter. . .  No, National Correspondant!  Much better.</p>

<p>Woody here, coming to you live from Victoria, British Columbia.  Yah.
Well, today I have a job interview.  This is a good thing.  This will bring
me inside for the rainy winter, as I am currently a construction labourer.
Winters on Salt Spring are very wet, and I have developed many bruises from
working with hand tools on cold mornings.  Keyboards are much more
forgiving.  Not to say you can't get bruised by a keyboard.  Call blake "My
Bitch" before he's had his morning latte, and this point will be
illustrated.</p>

<p>So, with any luck, I will be doing QA for a company that writes
interfaces between ECG machines and allows for a person at one location to
bw monitored by a doctor at another location, while the data is being
stored at another.  Sounds pretty cool.  I've been missing my geek fix, so,
although I'd prefer to be doing admin on *nix systems, QA on VB will do. .
.  Hush, you!</p>

<p>Well, shower, off to print resume, off to get a Sally Bun (oh, you'll
hear more about Sally Buns in the future), then interview, then hook up
with an old buddy, then a we design contract meeting, then a squash game.
Full day, eh?  And still, I take the time to keep you updated.  Damn,
that's one fine fellow.</p>

<p>One (or two) last thing(s) before I go.  First, I haven't had my coffee.
This should explain my otherwise cryptic use of "paragraphs" in this post.
I judt kind of start a new one when the urge strikes me (as opposed to
Blake's keyboard).  Second, well, I always allow for another point when
saying how many I'll have.  That leaves room in case anything comes to mind
while prattling off the first. In this instance, there is no second, but if
there had been, I'd have been set.</p>

                    <p>Well, I meant to write something about turning 30 here last week,
when I had the whole week off, but somehow I didn't have the time.  In
my defense, I watched many movies, read four books, and went to the
zoo, so it isn't as if I was sitting around doing nothing.  I did get
some truly excellent presents from Amy.  Underwear, books, and a NetMD
(<a href="http://makeashorterlink.com/?B258129C3">this one</a>), which
I've been listening to almost constantly, making various mixes of full
albums (Norah Jones, and NWA), random songs (Blue Man Group), and even
some BBC Radio Plays (The His Dark Materials series, which spans two
minidiscs at the highest compression!  7½ hours of radio play,
taken from RealAudio, through MP3 to ATRAC3-LP4).  Other than the new
stuff, 30 seems awfully similar to 29, which I'm sure comes as no big
surprise to anyone.  Um, and that's all about 30.</p>

On to equally interesting news.  I worked out again today, pushing
the weights up a little from where I had them last week just to see
how more weight would feel.  Not so bad, so I think I'm going to use
the new settings next time.  After I worked out, I had a blood
pressure of 127 over 85, which continues to be just fine, although
we'll see what the ham I'm having for dinner will do to it.  And
tomorrow I (hopefully) play some squash with Andy Cain, which will be
a nice aerobic workout to go with the anaerobic stuff I did this
evening.
