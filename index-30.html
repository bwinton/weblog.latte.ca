We signed a contract for the reno last week, and now the work
is beginning.  The work, for now, is mostly just talking about
what goes where and where to get stuff and what colours, and 
Blake and I have to buy lots of stuff; new light fixtures,
appliances, a kitchen faucet, tiles for the backsplash and the
front hall floor.  It would be swell if we had a car right now.
</p>
<p>
We got a couple of quotes, one which was horrifyingly high and
one which was alarmingly low.  Fortunately the people who quoted
low come highly recommended and they basically lowballed us, I
think, because they like Blake's dad and because they know that
we have years and years of work to do on this house and they
want in on the ground floor, so to speak.
</p>
<p>
So this reno looks like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Kitchen:
 <ul>
<li>new Marmoleum floor</li>
  <li>new cabinets, probably from Ikea</li>
  <li>big pass-through window to the dining room</li>
  <li>new (gas!) stove</li>
  <li>dishwasher (hallelujah!)</li>
  <li>new fridge</li>
  <li>
<a href="http://www.formica.com/publish/products/en/laminate/classics/skylark_boomerang.Specifications.0001.LargeImage.Image.gif">funky</a> Formica countertops</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>new electrical throughout, because we still have knob
  and tube almost everywhere</li>
<li>new light fixtures some places</li>
<li>knock out most of the walls on the main floor to make
  it more open, although I would stop short of calling it
  "open concept" because we'll still have a well-defined
  front hall and the kitchen will still be cut off by a
  wall, albeit a wall with a big pass-through window</li>
<li>replace the hardwood in the front hall with black and
  white mosaic tile in some cool retro pattern (we'll use 
  the hardwood from the front hall to patch the holes from
  taking out the walls.)</li>
<li>New deck!</li>
</ul>
<p>
All in all it's a fairly small reno; we are not adding any
rooms or messing with any outside walls.  It is scheduled
to take about a month, with the actual work beginning
mid-March.
</p>
<p>
I am really excited; once the reno is done we will still
have a crappy old house, but it will be a crappy old house
with a really nice, functional kitchen and light switches
in logical places, and I can deal with that!

So yeah, running.  I haven't been.  For a while there we 
were in a crazy deep freeze the likes of which I moved out of
the prairies to avoid, and then I hurt my back, and... oh,
I don't know, there's always something that comes up.  
Dishes!  Dishes are the last straw for me, it seems; I can
manage to do the housekeeping and look after the kids and
go to choir and run and read and stuff when I have a dishwasher,
but when I have to do dishes by hand it all goes to hell.  How
do we generate so many dirty dishes?
</p>
<p>
I did do a tortuous and pathetic 3K last weekend, which is
better than the nothing I have done since.
</p>
<p>
But I think I'm okay with a winter lull.  I would like, ideally,
to run through December, just to counteract the holiday madness
both psychologically and healthwise, but I don't think I would
be too devastated if I took a break from running every January
and February.  It's hibernation time.  That's long enough, though.
Once March comes I will set a schedule and work towards running
5K straight through without a walking break.

    <p>When I listened to the first song, they sounded like a band I listened
to back in university.  Something like a cross between Sloan and Live,
or The Lowest of the Low.  Live, maybe?  It wasn't any of those but
that was the sort of genre it reminds me of...</p>

<p>I guess what I'm trying to say there is that as far as I can tell,
it's classic Indie Rock, circa 1994, and god help me, I love it.  I'm
sure the muscial landscape has changed in the last 12, no, wait, 13
years, but it's good to see that there are still bands out there who
are playing the things I used to hear.  Damn, does that means that I'm
old, when I start liking songs like the ones I used to hear?  I'll
just chalk it up to nostalgia instead of age.  Shut up.</p>

<p>I should probably put in <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Forecast">a link</a> to more info,
shouldn't I?</p>

<p>Finally, I know I totally missed the 1500 character target, but
man, this reviewing thing is hard.  All the harder when I'm only
listening to music at the office, where I'm really trying to
concentrate on my job, instead of on the music.  The first few times I
listened to the album, I was halfway through the following album
before I realized that I should have been listening.</p>

    <p>Pretty sweet.  They were described to me as "slightly-harder drum
and bass", which worried me a little, since I didn't know if I would
be up for something heavy, but either it was only slightly-harder, or
I don't know how hard regular drum and bass is, or I ended up being in
a heavier mood than I thought I was, because I thoroughly enjoyed the
album.  It sort of drifted into the background, which is exactly what
I'm hoping for when I listen to music at work.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure what else to say here.  I suppose I could add
that they didn't seem as minimal as the Plastikman/FUSE albums I've
got, and they were a lot less sample-heavy than Mushroom Jazz by Mark
Farina, but I don't think that really tells you much about the music
itself.  Hopefully, with more exposure to some quality drum and bass,
I'll be able to give more informed opinions, but for now, I guess this
will have to be my baseline for future reviews.</p>

<p>Oh, one more thing, the next few reviews might run a little late,
because even though I've listened to the music, I only have a couple
of hundred words written about each of them, and I'm guessing that
it'll take some re-listening to think of more things to say.</p>

    <p>Since our <del>receptionist</del> (Oops, "Office Manager") left,
and I took the opportunity to grab a copy of her entire iTunes folder,
I've been listening to a lot of new music.  Most of it is even
actually new, and not just new to 33-year old fogeys who are stuck
back in 1992.  So, along with some book reviews that I'm in the middle
of writing, I figured that I would write some reviews of the new tunes
that I've been listening to, in the hopes that it will get me posting
a little more to this weblog thing.</p>

<p>I promise to not review more than one thing per day, so as to not
overwhelm the five of you who read this weblog.  Having said that,
I've been listening to more than one thing in the past couple of days,
so I've got a few things for review queued up, which means that we'll
probably have at least one per (week-)day for the next little while.
I'm aiming for approximately 200 words per review, or more accurately
somewhere near 1500 characters, because my editor (Scite) has a count
of characters, but no word-count that I could find.  Clearly this post
isn't going to make that limit, but then again, it's not actually a
review, so I don't mind.</p>

<p>And I've just realized that I lied.  I'll probably be doing some
book reviews as well, and perhaps even a review of a restaurant, if
one catches my fancy.  If I were younger, with more desposable income,
I'ld be all over the new gadget reviews, too.</p>

    <p>
Cordelia has been talking for a while; her
first words were about the same as Delphine's,
"up" and "cat" and "Daddy!"  In the last 
couple of weeks her vocabulary has really 
expanded; "stuck" and "spoon" and "Mimi",
"baby", "milk", "'delia", "book", "more".  
</p>
<p>
She's changed in the last few days.  We
make fun of Blake's parents because
they always say the girls have changed,
every week: "she's changed so much!"  But
this week Cordelia really <em>has</em> 
changed, with
her words, with putting ideas together,
with wanting to be read to;
even her face looks less babyish.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia is very good at putting things
away; she joins in when I'm putting toys
in boxes, she puts books back on the shelf.
She loves lining up cups on coasters; she
loves order.  I think she's going to be the
neat one.
</p>
<p>
I've complained before about how tedious
and high-maintenance babies are, and I'm
not about to stop, at least not until Cordelia
is past the tedious and high-maintenance
stage.  Babies and stairs, particularly,
don't mix; if I were smarter I wouldn't
have moved from a one-floor condo to a
three-floor house until after Cordelia 
could manage stairs.
</p>
<p>
Here is what I have to do if I need to go
to the bathroom when I am with Delphine:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Say "Hey, Delphine, I am going to go
    to the bathroom".</li>
<li>Go upstairs, do my business, and come
    back.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Here is what I have to do if I need to go
to the bathroom when I am with Cordelia:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Find Cordelia.</li>
<li>Pick up Cordelia.</li>
<li>Open baby gate, carry Cordelia upstairs.</li>
<li>Go into bathroom, close door, put 
Cordelia down, do my
business while trying to pursuade Cordelia
to stay out of the trash, leave the toilet
brush alone, and not unravel the entire roll of
paper.</li>
<li>Pick up Cordelia.</li>
<li>Carry Cordelia downstairs.</li>
<li>Lock baby gate.</li>
</ol>
<p>
It's just... ugh.  It's just that little 
babies are so <em>physical</em>!  So 
physically demanding.  And prone
to falling off things.  Cordelia falls
off things all the time; she has fallen
off the step stool, off an upturned Lego
container, off the couch... it's a rare
day, in fact, when she doesn't fall off
something.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, there something nice about
babies.  Cordelia adores us; she is
delighted to see us every morning, she 
comes to us when she is sad or hurt, she
loves to cuddle and kiss and play with
us endlessly.  We are her life, her sun
and moon and stars, in a way
that we just aren't with the infinitely 
more complicated Delphine, who tells me
I am not her friend at least once a week,
who sometimes gives me the silent treatment
when I pick her up from daycare, who argues
about every damn thing just for the sake of
it.  Cordelia is still at the stage where
she is our little dolly, she can safely
be objectified, whereas Delphine is well on
her way to being an actual person, and
like any person, she on occasion objects
to being scooped up and snuggled, she 
sometimes wants to be left alone, she
frequently has desires which conflict with
ours.
</p>
<p>
I'd still rather that than have to carry
her everywhere, though, which is why I am
still looking forward to Cordelia being a
little older and little more physically 
autonomous.  But for now I am enjoying the
unadulterated baby love.

If I had one of those blogs with a "mood" field, I would write
"bummed" and put a little sad face.  I just poked around the
Queens and OISE (Ontario Institute for Studies in Education) 
websites and found out that because I got such crappy marks in
university I don't qualify to get into their teacher education
programs.  I have no idea what I should do about this -- do I
have to get another degree?  Go to someone's office and beg?
</p>
<p>
It's extra ironic because I have a three year degree, so according
to Queens that means I need a B average, but if I had a four year
degree they wouldn't even care what my marks are.  
However, the reason my marks are
so bad is that I was taking Honours (four-year) courses, which are
harder than the three-year program courses.  If I had been taking
three-year General courses I would have been getting As and Bs
instead of Cs and Ds.  And Fs.
</p>
<p>
Also ironic because
I am smart and I would make a good teacher (I think), and university
was a million years ago — since then I have worked, travelled,
become a parent — and how well I did or didn't do back then
is so irrelevant to how well I would do as a teacher now, ten 
years later, that I am frankly shocked and taken aback that it would
even come up.  But they don't have any options for mature students;
I am bound now by bad decisions I made when I was eighteen.  Still.
Again.
</p>
<p>
Stupid.  I guess I will have to go meet with a registrar and see
if they have any bright ideas.

We have finally beaten the house into enough submission that I
can sit down and read a few pages in good conscience, thank
god.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Another Day in the Frontal Lobe: A Brain Surgeon
Exposes Life On The Inside</em> by Katrina Firlik</strong> is
the autobiography of a neurosurgeon.  It's well-written and
interesting if you're like me and are fascinated by the workings
of the human body and the freaky things that happen to it.
Sometimes I wish I had done something more brainy in university,
and that I was something more impressive now, like a Doctor or
a Lawyer (not really), but this book made me glad I'm not a
neurosurgeon, or really any of the emergency-oriented
medical specialities.  I love my easy, predictable, homey
life and I would hate to work long hours and be on call all
the time.  Although the saving people and being really important
part would be cool.
</p>
<p>
I went to <a href="http://www.katrinafirlik.com/">Katrina Firlik's
website</a> and found these 
<a href="http://www.katrinafirlik.com/drawings.htm">funny little
drawings of 
neurosurgery-related objects juxtaposed with objects in nature</a>.
Also the UK title for this book, <em>Brain Matters: Adventures 
of a Brain Surgeon</em>, is a hundred times better than the
North American title.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Cockeyed: A Memoir</em> by Ryan Knighton</strong>
is another autobiography, this one by a guy who started going blind
in his teens and is now completely or almost completely blind.  It
chronicles the hijinks that ensue when you mix normal teenage
stupidity with unreliable eyesight, when you get a bunch of
blind people together at Blind People Camp (blind Tai Chi, anyone?
Blind canoeing?), and the deep, deep badness of going to
South
Korea to teach English with your girlfriend and pretend you're
not blind.
</p>
<p>
This book made me laugh until I wept; I could hardly tell Blake
what I was laughing at.  Knighton is a brilliant writer and has
a real knack for describing the inherent slapstick of blindness,
without making you feel like an asshole for laughing at it.
He is also unflinchingly honest about his own behavour and
emotions, and the effect he has on others.
I think I will try and find other stuff he has written and see
how he deals with other material.  I hope he has children and
writes about them, actually, because I bet that would be
hilarious.
