    <p>
Cordelia is just about nineteen months old.  I took her
to the doctor for her eighteen month checkup and she has
gained almost no weight and grown, like, an inch.   I
don't have the exact numbers but really, no-one is all
that interested.
</p>
<p>
She recently uttered her first real sentence: she pointed
to a spot that Morgan had recently vacated and said
"Morgan sat, uh, there."  She says "uh" a lot, and she's
fairly bad with names, including mine.  I was holding her
and looking in the mirror a few weeks ago and I said
"Who's that?"  She said "Baby!"  So I said "Who else?"
"Baba... uh... Mummy!"
</p>
<p>
She's good on her feet; she runs, she climbs, she tries
to keep up with her big sister at the park.  She can almost,
almost, climb downstairs like a normal person.  Except today
she was standing on a step and she overbalanced and came 
headfirst down the stairs.  Fortunately I was standing right
there and caught her, head first, but she's not allowed to
go downstairs by herself any more, unless she goes backwards
which she never does any more because going backwards is
for babies!
</p>
<p>
She likes to walk; every time we try and put her in the
stroller she protests, and she would much rather be out
and walking on the sidewalk, climbing up onto every
ledge and wall, picking up dubious bits of jetsam, wandering
onto people's lawns.  But once she's in the stroller she's
usually cool with that, too.  She's generally a laid 
back little kid, really.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia loves sit at the dining table and colour when Delphine
is there drawing.  She loves stickers even more, but I don't
really have any that are big enough for her to manage.  I
will have to pick some up.  She also tends to draw on the
walls, which Delphine never did, so walking around the house
with writing implements is another thing she is not allowed
to do.
</p>
<p>
She dances!  I was reading a book of nursery rhymes this
morning, and singing the ones which have a tune, and she
got up and danced; "dancing" is just turning around and 
around and then throwing herself at the ground, which
works best for Ring a Ring a Rosie but which she manages
to adapt to a surprising number of songs.
</p>
<p>
What else?  I gave her a haircut a week or so ago; she
was getting a little mulletty in the back while the wispies
at the front were getting in her eyes, so I just generally
hacked at it all around and it came out mainly pixie-ish
with a little of the Franciscan monk around the front.
You'll have to take my word for it, it's pretty cute.  
Delphine didn't like it, though, on the grounds that she
didn't look like Cordelia, and that she looked like a boy.
She seems to have gotten used to it, though.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia is very independent; she wants to put in clothes
by herself, she insists on feeding herself (and in the
manner of her choosing, which is usually with fingers --
did you know hummus is finger food?  Me either.)  She
gets very irate if you try and do things for her.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia is still a lot of fun; she is quick to laugh
and recovers from setbacks quickly.  She's affectionate
and cuddly and generally easy and pleasant to be with.
It's probably also way easier to deal with a second child;
I am fairly sure that nothing I do is going to break
her, so I just let her be most of the time.

D: I think she is real.<br>

D: She has wings, and wings are real, so she is real.

Kind of hard to argue with that, but I tried it anyway.

She has also taken to saying "Let's run along, and not get into

You go do that, then!

We're one week into the reno, and the dust is flying.  The
electrical is almost done; we are replacing all the old
knob-and-tube wiring with the modern stuff, putting in
mostly new  light fixtures and light switches  in sensible
places, instead of three feet into the bedroom, or behind
the far door to the dining room, or just nowhere at all
in Delphine's room. (She had one of those bank-pen-chain
pull switches that she didn't have a hope of reaching for
another ten years.)
</p>
<p>
On the main floor, where most of the big changes are 
happening, the demolition is nearly complete.  They have taken
down all the walls except that between the kitchen and
the dining room, and that which defines the front hall
(and keeps the drafts out).  They've taken out the old
cabinet in the kitchen, the sink and its cabinet, and
the old gnarly linoleum tiles and subfloor.  They've cut and framed
a hole between the kitchen and the dining room, which
is going to be finished with some trim salvaged from 
the original arch between the dining room and the living
room.  The only demolition which remains to be done is
taking up the hardwood in the front hall (we are going
to put in vintage-style black and white mosaic tile 
instead).
</p>
<p>
Next week the inspector is coming in for the electrical,
and then they will patch the walls and start painting
upstairs.  They are going to move the plumbing for the 
sink, and put in the vent for the range hood, and lay
the new subfloor in the kitchen.  It's been fun watching
them tear the place apart, but I am really going to enjoy
watching them put it back together.
</p>
<p>
We haven't been able, to the shock of no-one, to salvage
and reuse as much as I originally thought we would.  I
said we would keep the cabinet in the kitchen but quickly
changed my mind when I realized how much I like runners on
my drawers, and base cabinets that don't go all the way
to the floor, and not having huge frames in the way of my
stuff, and maybe upper cabinets that are deep enough to 
store a dinner plate.  I got rid of the metal trim on
the counter because Jillian's right, it's a total pain
to keep clean.  I got rid of the stove because there's 
just no way to make an ancient electric stove into a
modern gas stove.  I got rid of the cabinet for the
sink because again, I wanted to get rid of the frames
and have more versatile cabinetry (we are putting a bunch
of drawers under the sink cabinet).
</p>
<p>
I haven't even kept many light fixtures; I kept the 
pretty fixtures in the girls' rooms, but almost all of
the others are gone, with the exception of a gorgeous
Nouveau fixture from the front hall which is too dim
to be useful but which we will reuse somewhere where
we don't need all that much light.
</p>
<p>
Ironically, we are ripping out a genuine vintage kitchen
and replacing it with a vintage-inspired kitchen.  Our
cabinets are going to be 
<a href="http://ths.gardenweb.com/forums/load/kitchbath/gal1212265932402.html?14">Applad White</a> which is flat-panel painted white,
very much like the original cabinet.  The floor is
going to be 
<a href="http://www.forbo.com/framework/ModuleFiles/mod_Product/Product/Image/994/3038.jpg">Marmoleum</a> in Caribbean, and the 
countertops will be 
<a href="http://www.formica.com/publish/site/na/us/en/index/laminate/colors_collections/classics.detail.6940.0001.html">Formica's Skylark
Boomerang</a>.  Oh, and the paint is Benjamin Moore's Standish
White, which almost exactly matches the floor.  
I am going to look for a vintage-style
wallpaper to do a focal point, and maybe a cute fabric for
a little curtain.  Three more weeks to go!

We signed Delphine up for Kindergarten, to start in fall.
She's actually ready to start tomorrow -- she can dress herself
and write her name and go to the bathroom by herself -- but because 
her birthday is fairly early in the year she will be one of 
the older, more accomplished students in her class.  Fortunately
it's a mixed Junior/Senior Kindergarten class so if necessary
she can mingle with the five-year-olds, although by the time
<em>she</em> gets to SK she will be like Methuselah.  
</p>
<p>
I wonder about
skipping her to first grade a year early; I don't know if they
are keen on skipping grades in the Toronto school board, but
it seems that if you're going to do it, earlier would be
better than later, no?  But just proposing that makes me 
feel like one of those annoying "my kid is so wonderful
and smart and she needs special attention" parents.  But
honestly, if she is ready for grade one after a year of
kindergarten -- and I'm not saying she will be -- doesn't
it make sense to put her in it?
</p>
<p>
Speaking of people who think their kids are so special,
Dooce (who I normally love) wrote this in her monthly
letter to Leta, with respect to a question on a preschool
application form: "whoever gets to spend their days with 
you will be transformed by the experience, and that the 
only right answer would be: You will not be disappointed."
Seriously?  You know these people, preschool teachers, get
to meet hundreds of little kids, right?  You think your
little precious is going to be the one who transforms them?
Why?  What exactly about your kid is so special?  Is she
the reincarnation of Mother Theresa?  No, she's just 
another snotty, screaming, whining, pooping three-year-old,
just like mine and every other on the planet.
</p>
<p>
Having said that ("screaming, whining"), Delphine and I
are getting better at communicating with each other. I
read Barbara Coloroso's <em>Kids Are Worth It</em>, and
it really helped me figure out a way to talk to her and
deal with her which lets us both keep our dignity intact.
There's a real art to it, the balance between getting her
to do the things I want her to do without forcing her,
or just letting her do whatever she wants to.  I offer
her choices, compromises, I decide <em>what</em> she does and 
she decides <em>how</em>, but all the while I have to
maintain my authority so that when she's running away 
down the sidewalk I can yell "Stop!" and she will do it
right away.
</p>
<p>
Delphine loves a power battle â€” sometimes it seems
like she automatically defies me on everything: "Toast
for breakfast today!"  "I don't like toast!" (An out
and out lie.)  So then it's fun to offer no resistance:
"Okay, no toast for breakfast, let's have cereal!"  "I
want toast!"  Okay, toast it is, crazy kid.  
</p>
<p>
My favourite times are when we get to hang out together
without Cordelia.  Cordelia is still at an age where she
butts into whatever we're doing, but she's too young to
play board games or sit nicely and be read to, so when
we're all together I'm often playing interference, but when
it's just Delphine and I we can talk and read and do
things together like real people.  It doesn't happen very
often, though.

Well, it's four in the morning and I've been wide awake for at least
three-quarters of an hour.  I finally decided to stop lying in
bed thinking the same five thoughts over and over, and creep
down the world's creakiest stairs and make myself useful.
I don't think I will be sleeping again tonight, and I know
I'll regret it later this afternoon, but what can you do?
This must be what it's like to be Baba, or my brother Dave.
</p>
<p>
We are less than a week from the start of "demolition", a
rather grand name for clearing out the kitchen and taking 
down a couple of walls.  I suppose removing the little porch
from the back is pretty demolishy.  It all begins on Monday,
and in the intervening four days we need to clear as much
stuff as we can out of the main floor, and set up a makeshift
kitchen in the basement.  In the next month we are going to
become very familiar with what meals can and cannot be prepared
with a microwave, a toaster oven, a kettle and a crock pot.
I predict we will eat a lot of President's Choice frozen
meals.  And did you know they have microwave pizza?  Yeah...
</p>
<p>
The girls and I will also become very familiar with places
to hang out that are not home; Baba and Zaida's, the library,
the ROM, the park (if spring ever comes), Tanya's place, the
other library...  It's going to be a bit of a pain in the
ass, but I think the satisfaction of seeing the work progress
day after day will make up for it, unlike the changeless agony
of, say, trying to keep a condo clean and tidy while you're
selling it.

This Saturday Delphine broke a lifelong no-Macdonald's streak
by visiting the place for a friend's birthday party.  The party
was enjoyed by all, and Ursa and her mom joined us for the
bus ride home.
</p>
<p>
On the way, Delphine and Ursa amused us with their knock-knock
jokes:
</p>
<p>
Ursa: Knock knock!<br>
Delphine: Who's there?<br>
U: Orange!<br>
D: Orange who?<br>
U: Orange you glad a banana?
</p>
<p>
And then they laughed.  And then they told it again.  And again.
</p>
<p>
Delphine actually managed to deliver the "anita" knock-knock
joke successfully, but only once.  The second time it went
like this:
</p>
<p>
D: Knock-knock!<br>
U: Who's there?<br>
D: Anita!<br>
U: Anita who?<br>
D: Anita teeth!
</p>
<p>
(Delphine's go-to word when she needs to say something silly
is teeth, pronounced "teef".)
</p>
<p>
And then Ursa said "You need to learn some more jokes!"  Mmm-hmmm!
Anyone know any good knock-knock jokes?

    <p>
Cordelia is almost seventeen months old, and she's a
little bundle of fun.  She's learning lots of new words;
she's at that age where she learns new words every day,
and loves to imitate.  Today it was "snowsuit".  She
started off with "nosnos" and by the end of the day
pretty much had it down perfectly.
</p>
<p>
Lately her favourite word is "here", pronounced 
"heee-yer"; it started off as the word she uses when she
gives you something, but now she mostly uses it when she 
wants something, accompanied by urgent gesticulation.
</p>
<p>
She comes to me when I am on the computer, with
a dolly and a hat, and says "Hat!  Hat!  Hat!" until I put
the hat (usually far too large) on the dolly.  When we're
on the floor, and I'm sitting cross-legged, she 
turns around and reverses onto my lap from about a foot away.
She loves to be read to: "Book!  Book!" is another of her
favourite utterances.
</p>
<p>
She calls both cats "Mimi", and in fact she calls all 
four-legged mammals Mimi, as far as I can tell.
</p>
<p>
She bring boots: if we're going out (or if she would like
us to go out) she goes to the front hall and finds my
boots and brings them to me, one at a time.  "Boot!  Out?"
She loves to go out; the other day we went out and I 
shovelled snow while she played in it.  Because she was
trapped in a snowsuit with thumbless mittens there wasn't
much she could do, but she climbed up and down our step,
and sat down hard in the snow, "plunk", then laughed 
and got up again.  She finds her own fun.
</p>
<p>
When she goes downstairs she goes backwards, and she's
very conservative about it:  she likes
to turn around and start crawling backwards a good two
feel away from the top of the stairs.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia is very demonstrative; several times a day she
comes up to me, unbidden, and hugs me around the knees.
She loves to give kisses and hugs around the neck, too.
She laughs a lot, and if she falls you can often get her
to laugh instead of cry.
</p>
<p>
She still sleeps really well, from around six-thirty
until around six am.  She has taken, recently, to waking
up and crying around ten or ten-thirty, but Blake loves
it because he can go in and have a cuddle with her before
putting her down again.  I suppose that's a bad habit to
encourage, but I doubt she will keep it up forever.  And
honestly, if she's fifteen and she still wants a few minutes
of attention from her parents at ten-thirty at night I
will count myself lucky.
</p>
<p>
She's still nursing, in the morning and before her nap
and at bedtime, and sometimes during the day if she's 
hurt herself and needs comfort.  It's lovely.  She also
more or less feeds herself at table; we bought a 
<a href="http://www.hipposmile.com/ourproducts.php">cheap
Canadian knockoff of the overpriced Tripp-Trapp chair</a>
for each girl and Cordelia <em>loves</em> to be at table
instead of behind everyone in the high chair.  She makes a
colossal mess but she has a nice time.
</p>
<p>
She's good company; she is easy-going and quick to laugh
and to learn. I can leave her to her own devices 
during the day and she'll play by herself for ages.  She
plays with dollies, she climbs onto things, she pulls stuff
out of boxes at an astonishing rate.  She plays nicely with
Delphine too, or I should say Delphine plays nicely with her.
They are so different and so delightful; I could not have
picked out better children from a Children Catalogue.
