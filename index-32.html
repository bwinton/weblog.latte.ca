It's not all puppies and roses with Delphine.  She's
testing us all the time lately, on matters both trivial and
not.  This morning we wanted her to be quiet so she
wouldn't wake up Cordelia, and instead she screamed
"I don't want to be quiet!"  Cordelia woke up, I got
really mad at Delphine.  So I pinched her.
</p>
<p>
I don't want to admit that, because some people think
I'm such a great mother, but I have to be honest.
There are people who read this blog who have
crazy kids (like mine), who have trouble handling 
their anger, 
who have made parenting mistakes, and to sit here
and act like Delphine is always good and I am
always cool and perfect
would be a disservice to them and to the whole
concept of talking about parenting.  
</p>
<p>
I wasn't cool — I
was really really angry because it was 5:30 in the
morning and I wanted Cordelia to stay asleep and
Delphine picked that stupid time to see if we
were serious about the "be quiet" thing.
</p>
<p>
I didn't pinch her all that hard, but I wanted to.
This isn't the first time I have wanted to hurt her
because I was angry, but it's the first time I ever
did it.  I hope it's the last.  I have a horrible 
temper and Delphine is trying it more and more
lately.  Hopefully this testing phase will pass
quickly, but of course there will be other
irritating phases in the future.  As is always 
the case on all those parenting shows, the problem
that needs to be fixed is me.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, now Delphine is happily reading books
to her Daddy, none the worse for her experience.
I just hope I can keep the ratio of good 
parenting to appalling mistakes high enough that
she is always resilient enough to bounce back
so easily from my bad behaviour.

                    <p>Well, that was kind of fun, but the TTC strike, instead of being
the huge boon that I had hoped it would be, turned out to result in
millions of cars backing their way up Yonge Street, almost all the way
to Lawrence.  Since we were all in a group, we couldn't (or didn't
want to) filter past them on the right, so instead of half an hour, it
ended up taking us 45 minutes to get from Lawrence to Bloor, by which
point all the other commuters had left.  By the time we got to the
pancake breakfast, the line was far too long for me, and so I just
went straight to work.  (I should probably mention that this happened
to me last time, and so I had already packed a container of Cheerios
and powdered milk which I ate when I got to the office.)</p>

<p>An idea for next time might be to head down one of the side
streets, maybe even one with a bike lane?  That way it would both be a
faster ride, and would show people how they might get down to work on
their bikes when they didn't have police blocking traffic for them.
(I wouldn't commute down Yonge street every day, so it's not really a
great introduction to bike commuting in the city.)</p>

<p>Apart from those minor problems, it was good to meet <a href="http://bikerefugee.blogspot.com/">Darren</a>, who had twice as
many people show up for his unofficial commute as I did, (two,
counting himself, as opposed to one, counting myself, ;) and I got
interviewed for a video of some sort.  I'm afraid I didn't come off
that well.  I seemed to be repeating myself, and stammering a lot, but
I hope whomever it was got some useful footage out of me.</p>

want to be part of the Bike Week Group Commute.  So in a similar vein,
I'ld love to be part of a Pre-Group Commute from Yonge and Davisville
up to Yonge and Lawrence.  I plan on leaving at about 7:00 to make it
an easy ride to Yonge and Lawrence by 7:30.  The route will be over to
Duplex, and then up to Roehampton (just North of Eglinton), and then
up Yonge to Lawrence.</p>

<p>I'll be wearing an orange jacket and a golden helmet, and the back
of my bike will have a black pannier. Hope to see you there!</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> If this <a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/weblog/on-143_metric_e.html">weather</a>
holds up, I'll skip the orange jacket and just go with a black "<a href="http://www.goldenpalacemobile.com/">GoldenPalace.com</a>"

                    <p>
There will come a day, probably when your baby is around five
or six months, that she will no longer be amused by brightly
coloured or pastel coloured, hard or squishy baby toys.  No
matter how novel they are, your baby will somehow be able to
detect that they are intended for her, and as such she will
turn her little baby nose up at them, especially when you
particularly want her to be quietly absorbed in something,
like when you're at a restaurant or on a plane.
</p>
<p>
It is at those times that you will have to resort to baby
toys that aren't.  Fortunately there are plenty of them,
and anyone who has had a baby for a while has a few tricks
up their sleeve.
</p>
<h4>In Your Bag</h4>
<p>
Keys, of course, are classic.  They jingle, there are
lots of different and interesting textures, they are
cold and hard on itchy teething gums, and it doesn't 
matter if you slobber all over them.  Provided you
clean them off before you give them to the baby.
</p>
<p>
Credit cards (or perhaps more sensibly, loyalty cards
or something else you can easily replace) are nice too.
They're a good size and weight to hold on to, and they have those
interesting embossed letters on them.
</p>
<p>
Water bottles -- for some reason babies love water 
bottles.  Both Cordelia and Delphine played with them
for hours!  Well, minutes, which are like hours in 
baby years.
</p>
<h4>In Your Kitchen</h4>
<p>
The kitchen is packed with interesting things to chew
on.  Wooden spoons are great -- you hardly ever see
baby toys made of wood, so it's probably a new and
exciting texture for your baby.  Teaspoons are nice,
too -- smooth and hard and shiny.  Delphine really 
liked a silicone spatula, and Cordelia amused herself for
half-an-hour the other day with a bright red silicone
basting brush.  It must have felt so interesting in
her mouth, all those little soft silicone bristles.
</p>
<p>
Measuring cups and small bowls are fun too, especially
when you drop them on the floor and they make a
spectacular rang-tang-tanging noise.  (Unless you
have a baby who startles easily, in which case she
will probably scare herself and cry and cry.)
</p>
<p>
I had a surprise hit the other day with one of those
mesh bags you wash your bras in -- Cordelia sucked it,
she chewed it, she stuffed it in her mouth and pulled
it out again (it was like a magic trick), she found
the label and chewed on that.  No end of amusement!
</p>
<h4>In Your Living Room</h4>
<p>
Okay, there's not much in here -- you don't want
your kid playing with your CDs or chewing your books.
But there is one thing that every baby covets: the
remote control.  And don't try and buy one of those
brightly coloured fake-o toy remotes, either, your
kid is too smart for that.  She wants the real thing!
The only hope is to find an old remote that doesn't
work any more, take out the batteries and make sure
none of the bits are going to come off, and let her
have it.
</p>
<h4>In Your Bedroom</h4>
<p>
Hairbrushes and combs keep Cordelia amused while I
change her diaper, and sometimes when I'm desperate
I give her a lotion bottle for a few moments (after
checking that the lid is secure.)
</p>
<p>
Fabric is fun for babies; I have had success with
a lovely pair of brightly printed silk boxer shorts
(sorry Blake).  Silk is especially good for a baby
who is just beginning to grip, because it is incredibly
light and easy to get a grip on.  Cordelia 
seems to enjoy the texture of a wet or dry facecloth.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
The bottom line is, don't feel that you have to limit
your baby to baby toys.  You can give her any old thing
provided it's reasonably clean, and that it's not going to
break up into chokeable or sharp pieces. Use your
common sense, and you and your baby will be quietly
amused for, well, minutes.

One of the things -- one of the many things -- I love about
this condo is that it's right on a major street, so when
I open the windows the sounds of the city come into my 
living room.  Traffic, sirens, the "beep, beep, beep" of
a truck backing up, people shouting to their friends...
crazy people yelling, the odd car crash.  To most people,
I guess, this doesn't sound so hot, but I like the
feeling of being in the middle of something without
having to actually leave the house.

                    <p>As I <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake/random/biking/SoTired.html">mentioned
previously</a>, I'm going to head up to Balm Beach sometime in late
July.  This sort of worried me, since up until now, all my biking was
commuting (8 km one way, 12 km the other), or going on slightly longer
group rides (21 km, but only 13.6 km/h).  None of these tiny rides
would prepare me for a 135 km trek up to Balm Beach.</p>

<p>So I decided to go on one of the <a href="http://www.bikerally.org">PWA Bike Rally</a> training rides.  Specifically, the one this
morning, heading up to <a href="http://www.bikerally.org/trainingmaps2006/87k_KennedyMusselman.pdf">Musselman Lake</a>.  It ended up being almost 94 km for me, instead
of the 87 km they claim it will be, but I figure most of that is my
walking my bike onto and off of the TTC.  Even counting those slow
kilometers, though, I still managed to average 23.2 km/h, which is
really quite respectible, I feel, for my first time out.  And yeah, it
totally wasn't a problem.  I mean, I'm quite tired now, but I'm still
up and walking around, and I think I could even have biked home, if I
had to.  Much easier to pay my $2.10 to the TTC, and let them carry
me, though.</p>

<p>What else...  I met a bunch of really friendly people, and rode in
a group of two or three most of the way there and most of the way
back.  I've heard that it's quite different to ride alone, and I
expect I'll get the chance to find out (unless someone wants to ride
up north with me...  ;)  Oh, yeah, and it took me five hours of wall
time to ride the 94 km, but only 4 hours of riding time.  I wonder why

Why is it that we have three thousand different pens and pencils

good ones?  One of which is at all times attached to
last week's cryptic crossword?

                    Blake said I should post something to the weblog, so I
direct your attention to 
<a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/roadsafety/childsafe/notiavis/dser/d200204/d200204e-qa.htm#9">this Government of Canada site</a> about car seats, specifically
the answer to question number nine, "Are there other concerns
in the use of a infant car seat outside a vehicle?"

<blockquote>
Two incidents have been reported where infants in infant car seats were left
unattended on hot stoves, resulting in one death and one infant suffering
serious burns.
</blockquote>

Argh.
