    <p>As I <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake/random/biking/SoTired.html">mentioned
previously</a>, I'm going to head up to Balm Beach sometime in late
July.  This sort of worried me, since up until now, all my biking was
commuting (8 km one way, 12 km the other), or going on slightly longer
group rides (21 km, but only 13.6 km/h).  None of these tiny rides
would prepare me for a 135 km trek up to Balm Beach.</p>

<p>So I decided to go on one of the <a href="http://www.bikerally.org">PWA Bike Rally</a> training rides.  Specifically, the one this
morning, heading up to <a href="http://www.bikerally.org/trainingmaps2006/87k_KennedyMusselman.pdf">Musselman Lake</a>.  It ended up being almost 94 km for me, instead
of the 87 km they claim it will be, but I figure most of that is my
walking my bike onto and off of the TTC.  Even counting those slow
kilometers, though, I still managed to average 23.2 km/h, which is
really quite respectible, I feel, for my first time out.  And yeah, it
totally wasn't a problem.  I mean, I'm quite tired now, but I'm still
up and walking around, and I think I could even have biked home, if I
had to.  Much easier to pay my $2.10 to the TTC, and let them carry
me, though.</p>

<p>What else...  I met a bunch of really friendly people, and rode in
a group of two or three most of the way there and most of the way
back.  I've heard that it's quite different to ride alone, and I
expect I'll get the chance to find out (unless someone wants to ride
up north with me...  ;)  Oh, yeah, and it took me five hours of wall
time to ride the 94 km, but only 4 hours of riding time.  I wonder why
the huge difference, since I didn't stop for an hour at the
midpoint.  Ah well, one of cyclings unexplained mysteries, I presume.</p>

    <p>Well, that was kind of fun, but the TTC strike, instead of being
the huge boon that I had hoped it would be, turned out to result in
millions of cars backing their way up Yonge Street, almost all the way
to Lawrence.  Since we were all in a group, we couldn't (or didn't
want to) filter past them on the right, so instead of half an hour, it
ended up taking us 45 minutes to get from Lawrence to Bloor, by which
point all the other commuters had left.  By the time we got to the
pancake breakfast, the line was far too long for me, and so I just
went straight to work.  (I should probably mention that this happened
to me last time, and so I had already packed a container of Cheerios
and powdered milk which I ate when I got to the office.)</p>

<p>An idea for next time might be to head down one of the side
streets, maybe even one with a bike lane?  That way it would both be a
faster ride, and would show people how they might get down to work on
their bikes when they didn't have police blocking traffic for them.
(I wouldn't commute down Yonge street every day, so it's not really a
great introduction to bike commuting in the city.)</p>

<p>Apart from those minor problems, it was good to meet <a href="http://bikerefugee.blogspot.com/">Darren</a>, who had twice as
many people show up for his unofficial commute as I did, (two,
counting himself, as opposed to one, counting myself, ;) and I got
interviewed for a video of some sort.  I'm afraid I didn't come off
that well.  I seemed to be repeating myself, and stammering a lot, but
I hope whomever it was got some useful footage out of me.</p>

I'ld love to be part of a Pre-Group Commute from Yonge and Davisville
up to Yonge and Lawrence.  I plan on leaving at about 7:00 to make it
an easy ride to Yonge and Lawrence by 7:30.  The route will be over to
Duplex, and then up to Roehampton (just North of Eglinton), and then
up Yonge to Lawrence.</p>

<p>I'll be wearing an orange jacket and a golden helmet, and the back
of my bike will have a black pannier. Hope to see you there!</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> If this <a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/weblog/on-143_metric_e.html">weather</a>

There will come a day, probably when your baby is around five
or six months, that she will no longer be amused by brightly
coloured or pastel coloured, hard or squishy baby toys.  No
matter how novel they are, your baby will somehow be able to
detect that they are intended for her, and as such she will
turn her little baby nose up at them, especially when you
particularly want her to be quietly absorbed in something,
like when you're at a restaurant or on a plane.
</p>
<p>
It is at those times that you will have to resort to baby
toys that aren't.  Fortunately there are plenty of them,
and anyone who has had a baby for a while has a few tricks
up their sleeve.
</p>
<h4>In Your Bag</h4>
<p>
Keys, of course, are classic.  They jingle, there are
lots of different and interesting textures, they are
cold and hard on itchy teething gums, and it doesn't 
matter if you slobber all over them.  Provided you
clean them off before you give them to the baby.
</p>
<p>
Credit cards (or perhaps more sensibly, loyalty cards
or something else you can easily replace) are nice too.
They're a good size and weight to hold on to, and they have those
interesting embossed letters on them.
</p>
<p>
Water bottles -- for some reason babies love water 
bottles.  Both Cordelia and Delphine played with them
for hours!  Well, minutes, which are like hours in 
baby years.
</p>
<h4>In Your Kitchen</h4>
<p>
The kitchen is packed with interesting things to chew
on.  Wooden spoons are great -- you hardly ever see
baby toys made of wood, so it's probably a new and
exciting texture for your baby.  Teaspoons are nice,
too -- smooth and hard and shiny.  Delphine really 
liked a silicone spatula, and Cordelia amused herself for
half-an-hour the other day with a bright red silicone
basting brush.  It must have felt so interesting in
her mouth, all those little soft silicone bristles.
</p>
<p>
Measuring cups and small bowls are fun too, especially
when you drop them on the floor and they make a
spectacular rang-tang-tanging noise.  (Unless you
have a baby who startles easily, in which case she
will probably scare herself and cry and cry.)
</p>
<p>
I had a surprise hit the other day with one of those
mesh bags you wash your bras in -- Cordelia sucked it,
she chewed it, she stuffed it in her mouth and pulled
it out again (it was like a magic trick), she found
the label and chewed on that.  No end of amusement!
</p>
<h4>In Your Living Room</h4>
<p>
Okay, there's not much in here -- you don't want
your kid playing with your CDs or chewing your books.
But there is one thing that every baby covets: the
remote control.  And don't try and buy one of those
brightly coloured fake-o toy remotes, either, your
kid is too smart for that.  She wants the real thing!
The only hope is to find an old remote that doesn't
work any more, take out the batteries and make sure
none of the bits are going to come off, and let her
have it.
</p>
<h4>In Your Bedroom</h4>
<p>
Hairbrushes and combs keep Cordelia amused while I
change her diaper, and sometimes when I'm desperate
I give her a lotion bottle for a few moments (after
checking that the lid is secure.)
</p>
<p>
Fabric is fun for babies; I have had success with
a lovely pair of brightly printed silk boxer shorts
(sorry Blake).  Silk is especially good for a baby
who is just beginning to grip, because it is incredibly
light and easy to get a grip on.  Cordelia 
seems to enjoy the texture of a wet or dry facecloth.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
The bottom line is, don't feel that you have to limit
your baby to baby toys.  You can give her any old thing
provided it's reasonably clean, and that it's not going to
break up into chokeable or sharp pieces. Use your
common sense, and you and your baby will be quietly
amused for, well, minutes.

Put some frozen blueberries in a bowl.  (I like
<a href="http://www.europesbest.com/">Europe's Best</a>
if you can get them.)  Pour in just enough whipping
cream to almost cover the berries.  Wait a few seconds

This is the world's best chocolate cake recipe -- it's
really easy, it always
comes out moist and rich and delicious, and best of all it
calls for cocoa powder, which I always have in the house,
not unsweetened chocolate, which I never have.  Use the
leftover buttermilk to make pancakes.
</p>
<h4>Cocoa Fudge Cake<br>
from the Betty Crocker Cookbook, 1969 Edition</h4>
<p>
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour<br>
1Â½ cups sugar<br>
2/3 cup cocoa<br>
1Â½ teaspoons baking soda<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
1Â½ cups buttermilk<br>
Â½ cup shortening<br>
2 eggs (1/3 to Â½ cup)<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla
</p>
<p>
Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour baking pan,
13x9x2 inches, or 2 round layer pans, 8 or 9x1Â½
inches. 
</p>
<p>
Measure all ingredients into large mixer bowl.  Blend
Â½ minute on low speed, scraping bowl constantly.
Beat 3 minutes high speed, scraping bowl occasionally.
Pour into pan(s).
</p>
<p>
Bake oblong 35 to 40 minutes, layers 30 to 35 minutes
or until wooden pick inserted in centre comes out clean.
Cool.
</p>
<p>
If desired (!), frost cake.

<h4>Cocoa Butter Frosting<br>
from the Betty Crocker Cookbook, 1969 Edition</h4>
<p>
Here's a frosting recipe I've used, with similarly
excellent results.
</p>
<p>
1/3 cup soft butter<br>
1/3 cup cocoa<br>
2 cups confectioner's sugar<br>
1Â½ teaspoons vanilla<br>
About 2 tablespoons milk
</p>
<p>
Mix thoroughly butter and cocoa.  Blend in sugar.
Stir in vanilla and milk; beat until frosting is
smooth and of spreading consistency.

Fills and frosts two 8- or 9-inch layers or frosts
a 13x9 inch cake.

One of the things -- one of the many things -- I love about
this condo is that it's right on a major street, so when
I open the windows the sounds of the city come into my 
living room.  Traffic, sirens, the "beep, beep, beep" of
a truck backing up, people shouting to their friends...
crazy people yelling, the odd car crash.  To most people,
I guess, this doesn't sound so hot, but I like the
feeling of being in the middle of something without
having to actually leave the house.
