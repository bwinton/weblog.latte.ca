    Blake said I should post something to the weblog, so I
direct your attention to 
<a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/roadsafety/childsafe/notiavis/dser/d200204/d200204e-qa.htm#9">this Government of Canada site</a> about car seats, specifically
the answer to question number nine, "Are there other concerns
in the use of a infant car seat outside a vehicle?"

<blockquote>
Two incidents have been reported where infants in infant car seats were left
unattended on hot stoves, resulting in one death and one infant suffering
serious burns.

Argh.

One the way home from daycare I stopped off at the LCBO 
to buy beer because it was just that hot.  
</p>
<p>
"Erik likes this," said Delphine as we walked through
the store.  "Erik likes these", she said, as we walked
into the beer section.
</p>
<p>
"Mummy likes these too, and Auntie Morgan," I said.
</p>
<p>
"No!  Just Erik.  What is this called?"
</p>
<p>
"It's called beer."
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  I don't drink beer.  I'm too little."
</p>
<p>
"That's right."
</p>
<p>
"When I am older I will drink beer.  But not now.
I am still young."
</p>
<p>
It's good to have something to look forward to.

She doesn't say such curious things any more, because
her language skills are better, but she's still pretty
amusing.
</p>
<p>
Today I went to pick her up from daycare, and asked
if she wanted to wear her sweater home.  She said
"I would rather not wear my sweater."  We don't 
talk down to her or modulate our vocabulary or
grammar, so she comes out with these very 
grown-up-sounding words and constructs.  Maybe they're only
funny if you can hear them coming out of a three-year-old.
</p>
<p>
On the way home we walked past another mother with a
baby, and Delphine said, loudly and in a scandalized
tone, "The baby has no shoes on!"  Fortunately the other
mother just laughed.
</p>
<p>
After supper Blake arrived home, having biked.  It's
warm today so he was pretty sweaty.  Delphine said
"You're wet like water, Daddy!  We could swim in
you!"

    <p>The birth story of
<a href="http://mike.reed.org/archives/journal/Sept02/090902.html">Rosalind 
Yates Reed</a> is great.  It was a natural birth, and for a while
there it sounds like it was a real pain in the ass, dragging on
and on.  But the point is that they got through it by trying a
whole lot of different things, and they didn't go for any of the
standard hospital interventions.  
</p>
<p>
I'm having trouble expressing why this story made such an impression
on me.  I guess it's because the labour was long and hard, but they
stuck to their principles and kept trying lots of different things
to move the labour along.  So often I get the message that you can
only have a natural birth if your labour is easy and progresses well.

You may be wondering how Cordelia's sleeping situation is
working out.  Probably not, but I want to write this down
because it's one of those things that parents forget, like
the pain of labour.
</p>
<p>
If you recall, last I posted Cordelia's crib was in our
bedroom, and she wasn't sleeping very well at night.
We had it like that for a while because we were going 
to go on vacation and didn't see the point in trying to
fix anything until we got back.
</p>
<p>
When we were on vacation, Cordelia slept in another 
room and Delphine slept in our room.  Cordelia took
good naps, two a day, and slept in her own bed from
around six in the evening until three in the morning.
When she woke up at three, I brought her into our bed
because I didn't want her crying to bother my parents.
Needless to say we weren't well-rested on our 
holiday.
</p>
<p>
When we got back, we recreated the situation with
Delphine in our room and Cordelia in another room --
Delphine's room, actually -- because that worked
very well.  Delphine sleeps like a log so we don't
wake her up when we come to bed, whereas Cordelia is
a delicate flower when it comes to sleep.
</p>
<p>
So far that has been working perfectly.  I put
Cordelia down at around 5:45 -- the routine is
diaper, pyjamas, brush teeth, nurse (usually to
sleep but sometimes she doesn't fall asleep), 
soother, bed -- I close the door and either 
she sleeps or she cries and then sleeps.  She
doesn't usually cry for more than five minutes,
but you can tell we're second-time parents because
we don't even time it any more.
</p>
<p>
She doesn't seem to wake up overnight, or if 
she does it's for one or two cries, then back
to sleep again.  She wakes up at around 5:45
or 6:00 in the morning.
</p>
<p>
She has two naps, at around 9:00 am and 1:00
pm.  The routine for them is diaper, nurse, 
soother, bed, and again sometimes I put her
down still awake.  Sometimes she cries, sometimes
she doesn't, and she usually sleeps for between
forty-five minutes (bad) and two hours (good).
</p>
<p>
So chalk up another victory for Weissbluth. The
only remaining challenge is figuring out how to
get both girls sleeping in the same room, so we
can have our bedroom back.

Since I started Cordelia on "solid" food at six months,
(instead of four as I did with Delphine) it seems like
she's graduated from starter mush to real, chewable food
really quickly.  
</p>
<p>
Some time in the last couple of weeks she has learned to
chew, and today for supper she had pasta, peas and canned
salmon -- the same thing Delphine and I had for lunch
yesterday.  People food - cool!

<p>(Posted to the LispMe@YahooGroups.com list)
Hello.</p>
<p>Let me start with a brief introduction.  My name is Blake Winton,
and I’ve owned a PalmPilot since back when they were called PalmPilots
and made by USRobotics.  I’ve been programming for them for years,
mostly in C and C++, with brief excursions into Lua, Python, and
Forth.  My day job consists mainly of Java (J2EE), with some Python
when I get the chance, and some JavaScript when I shouldn’t be using
Python.  On my off hours, I read a lot about other languages (recently
Objective C, OCaml, and Ruby).  Now I want to learn Scheme, and
thought that LispMe would be a good way to do it.  I’m finding some
things are tripping me up, mainly due to my attempts to transfer my
knowledge from other areas into LispMe.  (One piece I miss in
particular are something like Python’s List Comprehensions, which I
believe they sole from Haskell.)</p>
<p>So, I’m going through SICP, but while I’m doing that, I thought I
would try to do a "Real World" (tm) task, and write a program that
drew the Serpinsky Triangle, using an iterative, random, approach,
(Details available upon request,) and I’ve run into some small
questions about best practices, or basically how to do some simple
things.  In return for this help, I’ll create a sort of Tutorial
document for LispMe that will be able to help other people get up to
speed.  (If such a document already exists, please, someone, point me
to it!)</p>
<p>So, here’s what I’ve got so far.  It doesn’t work at all, but it’s
starting to take shape.</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre> 1

<p>And we’re done.  Any comments on it, from spacing to indentation to
whether I should use a vector or a list for the points themselves,
would be greatly appreciated.  If it matters, I plan on extending the
point to include red, green, and blue data as well, possibly with
accessors, looking something like this:</p>

    <p>Just because that would be too easy by itself, I'm going to follow
<a href="http://www.third-bit.com/drproject/drproject-dev/wiki/DrProjectOnCygwin">the instructions for Cygwin</a>, and we'll see what happens.</p>

<p>Okay, it's going fairly well so far...<br>
And then I get to step 3:<br></p>
<pre>Download, compile, and install sqlite from sources. Use version 3.3.5.</pre>
To compile it, I use "./configure", "make",
"make install", but that gives me the following error:
<pre><code>$ make install
tclsh ./tclinstaller.tcl 3.3
can't read "env(DESTDIR)": no such variable
    while executing
"set LIBDIR $env(DESTDIR)[lindex $auto_path 0]"
    (file "./tclinstaller.tcl" line 10)
make: *** [tcl_install] Error 1</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki/wiki?p=HowToCompile">This
page</a> tells me to remove each occurance of "$(DESTDIR)" from
Makefile, so I did, and it still didn't work, so I tried commenting out
"HAVE_TCL = 1" and then it all seemed to work just fine.</p>

<p>Until I got to the line:
</p>
<pre>chmod +x /lib/python2.4/site-packages/pysqlite-2.2.2-py2.4-cygwin-1.5.19-i686.egg/pysqlite2/_pysqlite.dll</pre>
which failed, but it was easy enough to change it to:
<pre>chmod +x /lib/python2.4/site-packages/pysqlite-2.2.2-py2.4-cygwin-1.5.19-i686.egg/pysqlite2/_sqlite.dll</pre>
which worked.


<p>Running
</p>
<pre>drproject-server --debug --port 8080 --auto-reload --create=/tmp/drproject</pre>
gave me the error:
<pre>drproject-server: error: --create option does not take a value</pre>

So I tried
<pre>drproject-server --debug --port 8080 --auto-reload --create</pre>
which said:
<pre>drproject-server: error: incorrect number of arguments</pre>

So I finally tried
<pre>drproject-server --debug --port 8080 --auto-reload --create /tmp/drproject</pre>
and it seemed good.

<p>Finally, I ran
</p>
<pre>drproject-server --debug --port 8080 --auto-reload /tmp/drproject</pre>
And it was good...

<p>So I created a script called "drproject-server-profile", to profile
it, containing the following lines
</p>
<pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/python
# EASY-INSTALL-ENTRY-SCRIPT: 'DrProject==1.0dev-r2084','console_scripts','drproject-server'
__requires__ = 'DrProject==1.0dev-r2084'
import sys
from pkg_resources import load_entry_point

import profile
profile.run("sys.exit(load_entry_point('DrProject==1.0dev-r2084', 'console_scripts', 'drproject-server')())", 'profile.tmp')</code></pre>
and <a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/profile.tmp">here</a> is the data!

    <p>I took a few notes at <a href="http://barcamp.org/TorCampDemoCamp5">DemoCamp 5</a> last night, and thought I'ld throw them up on the
web, in case anyone found them useful.</p>

<p>First, some notes on giving a good demo.<br>
In no particular order:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Set your screensaver's timeout to something long, so that you
    aren't continually hitting the spacebar/moving the mouse.</li>
  <li>Repeat the questions, so that people in the back can hear what
    was being asked.</li>
  <li>Log on before connecting the video.  I forget why, other than it
    looked a little more professional, perhaps.  Maybe someone forgot
    their password, or mistyped their username.</li>
  <li>Have someone type for you, so that you can concentrate on what
    you're saying, instead of trying to come up with fake data.</li>
  <li>When the demo's run out of time, don't try to fit in just one
    more thing...  Unless you have someone who can continue typing
    while you're answering questions.  ;)</li>
</ul>
<p>The next thing that struck me as sort of odd was that all the
presentations were web-based.  Isn't anyone working on a regular
desktop program anymore?</p>

<p>Finally, I also had some specific comments for <a href="http://blogmatrix.blogmatrix.com/">BlogMatrix</a>, which I
posted as a <a href="http://davidjanes.com/cgi-bin/xyx999.cgi?entry_id=3619">comment</a> on <a href="http://blog.davidjanes.com/">David Janes'
blog</a>.  (I've chatted with David over email a while ago, so I was
paying particular attention to his demo.)</p>

<p>In other DemoCamp news, I got a <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/000467.html">shout-out</a> from <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/">Greg Wilson</a>, which was very
gratifying, but I'm afraid I might have given him slightly the wrong
impression.  I suppose I do think that educators have a responsiblity
to prepare students for the real world, but I don't think that it's
the University-level educators who have that responsibility.  I think
that programming (by which I really mean logical thinking, but
programming is one of the best ways I know of to teach it, since the
results are very clearly right or wrong) should be one of the
mandatory courses in high school.  By the time you get to University,
you should be learning stuff like Lisp/Scheme, or ML, or concurrency,
or finite state machines.  Stuff that won't help you get a job, but
will hopefully help you do your job better, if only by expanding your
mind, and giving you new approaches to solving problems, or new
insights into what might be causing the problems in the first place.
I think that Institutions of Higher Learning should be about Higher
Learning, and leave the more vocational stuff to vocational schools.
This is somewhat ironic, since I went to Waterloo for the co-op
experience, one of the most vocational schools and programs out
there.</p>

<p>It could be that I'm looking at this all wrong, and that
universities are there to prepare you for a job, and then, once you're
out in the Real World, you go to places like <a href="http://web.engcorp.com/pygta">PyGTA</a>, or DemoCamp, or even
just watch <a href="http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/">some videos</a> and join <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lispme">a mailing list</a> about
Scheme to do your real learning.  Or maybe I just didn't follow the
academic path far enough.  When I left, I was <i>really</i> glad to
get the hell out of there, but now that I've been in the workforce for
a few years...  Wait, 7 years?  How did that happen?  Anyways, now
that I've been in the workforce, I'm thinking that I would like to go
back and try to get my Masters, or even my PhD in Computer Science.
At U of T, this time, since I far prefer living in Toronto to living
in Waterloo.</p>
