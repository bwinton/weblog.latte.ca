Okay, Cordelia is napping and Delphine is busy with <em>Charlie
and Lola</em> and I am for once not too tired to move, so allow
me to type a list of all the books I have read but not yet 
posted about, and perhaps even discuss one or two.
</p>
<h4>Books About Technical Stuff</h4>
<p>
<strong><em>Making the Most of Kitchens</em> by Gilly Love</strong>.
I read this before the reno when we were still trying to figure
out what we were going to do.  It wasn't really all that useful
because I had pretty much made all the big decisions, and we
didn't have that much flexibility in terms of layout anyway. 
However, if
I hadn't thought about what kind of countertop I wanted or
whether wood floors were a good idea, this book might have 
come in useful.  It had lots of pictures of different kitchens
for decorating inspiration.
</p>
<p>
The fact that it was an English book was a little weird
at times; she tries to talk you into refrigerating things.
Now there's an idea!
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Non-Designer's Design Book</em> by Robin 
Williams</strong> is a very useful overview for non-designers
who none-the-less find themselves having to design or judge
the design of letters, newsletters, logos, business cards,
posters, banners, and so on.  If, like me, you know what
you like but you don't know why, or (worse) you know what
you <em>don't</em> like but don't know how to fix it, this book
is a must-read.  
</p>
<p>
Williams breaks design down into four simple
principles (contrast, repetition, proximity, and alignment)
and then explains how to apply them to make your documents
more attractive and powerful while never overlooking the
most important thing, communication.
</p>
<p>
If I'm ever in a position where I have to create documents
I will definitely have a copy of this book on my shelf.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Vegetable Gardening From Planting to Picking: 
The Complete Guide to Creating a Bountiful Garden</em> by 
Fern Marshall Bradley and Jane Courtier</strong> and some 
other, slightly thinner but equally useful vegetable
gardning book which
I read rather belatedly this June and July.  My garden is
doing, frankly, rather dismally.  I just brought a foot long
zucchini home from my friend Tanya's garden, while my
zucchini plant has one little three-inch fruit on it.  
Honestly, who can't grow a zucchini?  But according to these
books I should have spent a lot more time and effort 
preparing the earth before planting, and I definitely need
to water, fertilize and weed more.  Maybe at all.  Yes,
there isn't really anything I did right this year, but
the lovely thing about gardening is you can always try
again next year.
</p>
<p>
The books cover everything from planning your garden
(another thing I didn't really do) to harvesting and
preserving your crops, as well as giving specific 
growing and harvesting instructions for a variety of
fruit and vegetables.  The only problem I had was that
the books were written for all of North America, so I
had to selectively ignore advice about things like okra
and peanuts which will never grow in good old Zone 5.
I wonder if there's a good Ontario vegetable gardening 
book.  (I bet the library would know!)
</p>
<h4>Books for Fun</h4>
<p>
<strong><em>The Rabbi's Girls</em> by Johanna Hurwitz</strong>.
I picked this up off the young adult rack at the library
because I am interested in juvenile literature with
Jewish content, if only to know what to steer the girls
towards when they get older and want some context about
their own personal history.  This is a novel about a
family that moves around the US midwest (? I think, 
I can't exactly remember) as their rabbi father
is shunted from community to community (parish?  I'm
sure that's not the word!)  It was a nice light read,
I can't complain.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Does Anything Eat Wasps? And 101 Other Questions</em>
by New Scientist</strong>.  This is a collection of questions
and answers from New Scientist's Last Word page (okay, I'm making
that up, I can't remember the name of their last page) where people
send in their perplexing sciency questions and other people take
a stab at answering them.  This was the first book I read after
we came up for air after the reno, and it was a nice easy
way to get back into using my brain again.  There's plenty 
of interesting stuff in here, but of course my favourite thing
was the question about why some people sound better than others
when they sing.
</p>
<p>
Okay, I only have three books to go, but Delphine would like
me to play with her so off I go!  Maybe Blake will hurt
himself again and post about it.

    <p>Well, I fell again, in a rather spectacular fashion.  I was
crossing St. Clair on Mt. Pleasant, and had just passed a
right-turning bus (on the left!  I’m not dumb enough to try to pass a
right-turning bus on the right!), and was signaling that I was going
to go back to the right-hand side of the lane (and therefore only had
one hand on the handles) when <b>*BUMP*</b>, I hit a large ridge in
the road, which turned the tire sideways, and I went straight over the
handlebars, skidding to a stop near the curb.  My bike flew overtop of
me, crashing into a hedge.</p>

<p>As I got up, I noticed that the crash had apparently turned both my
front light and my bike computer around, which was quite a shock until
I realized that it was actually the whole handlebars which had gotten
turned around.  I spun it back and then just sort of stood there for a
while, catching my breath and calming down a little.  A lady driving
by asked me if I was okay, and if I needed a ride somewhere, but I
told her I was fine, which wasn’t entirely the truth.  My knees are
pretty much fine, a little scrape, perhaps.  My elbow is completely
ripped up, and even though I cleaned it thoroughly with soap and water
and a lot of scrubbing, it still looks pretty ugly, and is probably
going to scab up something awful.  Worse than that, my shoulder is
really sore again, in the same way that it was after <a href="blake/random/biking/Ouch2.html">my last fall</a>, which can’t
be good.  I really need to get that looked at sometime.  The
<i>worst</i> thing, however, is that I ripped the elbow of my <a href="http://www.mec.ca/Products/product_detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524442618331&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302692363&amp;bmUID=1185298111978">cycling shirt</a>.  Yeah, I can darn it, but darn it, I liked that
shirt!  But with every negative, there comes a positive.  The power
button on my Palm TX started working again.  Weird.  Maybe the next
time I fall, the sound will come back on.</p>

<p>So, in summary, signaling on a bicycle is bad!  No, not really.
Maybe the lesson is more that bumps in the road aren’t the greatest,
especially when you don’t have your hands on the handlebars.  Other
than that, I don’t really think I have any takeaways from this one.
That intersection of St. Clair and Mt. Pleasant is treacherous,
perhaps.</p>

The facing went on!  Apparently we got fewer long planks than we
needed, so Cory couldn’t finish the deck itself, so instead he put on
the facing, and started building the frames for the planters.  Hey,
I just noticed the big long stair at the front.  Neat!<br clear="left"><a href="images/deck2007/0723b.jpg"><img align="left" src="images/deck2007/small/0723b.jpg" alt="Stonehenge.  Kinda." style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"></a>

Finally, a set of stairs!  I can’t tell you how excited I am about
those, although I am a little curious as to why that first step is
twice as long as the second…  Maybe the ground moved up.  Yeah, that's
what I'll go with.<br clear="left"><a href="images/deck2007/0720b.jpg"><img align="left" src="images/deck2007/small/0720b.jpg" alt="Stonehenge.  Kinda." style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"></a>

This line of stones brought to you by Cordelia.  It’s nice to see that
she can create order as well as chaos.<br clear="left"><a href="images/deck2007/0720c.jpg"><img align="left" src="images/deck2007/small/0720c.jpg" alt="A window to nowhere." style="margin-right:10px"></a>

And finally, a bonus picture for Andrew.  Yes, that was a window you
saw under our deck.  I’m not sure how we’ll get light into the
basement now.  Perhaps with electricity.  (I’m also not sure what is
going to happen to the edge of the deck, so we just might still get
some light from the edges.<br clear="all"></p>

quarter of the last board in the big group on the right isn't screwed

<p>Still to do, the stairs, the planters, and the garbage bin.  We
might not be getting a barbeque until the end of the summer, because a
friend of the family is downsizing, and might give us her’s, but
either way, I plan on having a party when the deck is done, with beer
and margaritas and some sort of munchie thing.  And of course you’re
all invited!  I’ll start planning it after the deck is actually done,

Okay, I promise that I’m not going to keep on posting more and more
pictures every day, if only because I don’t think I could take 14 good
pictures on the 14th day…  But today there were really three things I
wanted to point out.  The first is the view from the back door out
into the garden.  That’s pretty much how it’ll look every time I walk
out there.  Well, with a top on it, and planters and a garbage box and
a barbeque, and stuff, but that’s the layout.<br clear="left"><a href="images/deck2007/0717b.jpg"><img align="left" src="images/deck2007/small/0717b.jpg" alt="It’s big, from this angle." style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"></a>

The next shot is how it will look coming in to the house (if you’re
really small, like Cordelia).  Amy noticed that our house looks a
little ramshackle, with the door all boarded up and stuff.  (Cory (see
<a href="amy/houseandhome/reno/deck/july16.html">the previous
entry</a>) was nice enough to screw a few boards in so that the girls
didn’t fall out.)<br clear="left"><a href="images/deck2007/0717c.jpg"><img align="left" src="images/deck2007/small/0717c.jpg" alt="The Master Plan." style="margin-right:10px"></a>

And finally, the shot from Delphine’s room, where you can see the
full-width stairs down the back (on the top of the picture); the
cut-out for the stairs on the side; and, uh, well I guess that’s all
you can see, but on top of the cut-out will be one of the planters,
wiht a matching planter on the other side; underneath the cut-out will
be the garbage-box-thing; on the lower left will be the barbeque, and
the upper half will have a table and chairs for lounging.<br><br>
There’s also a nice amount of space on the right for my bicycle, so I
guess I should figure out a way to make that area a little smoother
and nicer to bike or walk on.<br clear="all"></p>

The nice gentleman on the left

on a re-do with the shades on.  I can get behind that.)  The picture
on the right is where we are as of now.  You can see sort of how far
it goes out (except that the board at the bottom of the picture is
about 5´ away from the door), and underneath the cat litter is a black
sheet of plastic, to kill whatever vegetation thinks it wants to grow
under there.</p>

    <p>A couple of days ago, I fixed a bug by deleting the class.  I don’t
often get to do that, but this class was buggy, hard to use, and
ill-considered in the first place.  I won’t post the code, but some
sample output is:
</p>
<pre><code>Fri Aug 27 00:00:00 EDT 1976
Julian Day: 2443017
Milliseconds since midnight: 43200000
Thu Aug 26 20:00:00 EDT 1976</code></pre>
Clearly that’s not right, since the top and bottom date should be the
same.  So, what was wrong with it?  Well...
<ul>
<li>Julian dates use milliseconds since noon, not milliseconds since
midnight.</li>
<li>The milliseconds since noon should be 57600000, because we’re in
EDT, which is 4 hours behind UTC.  (The cause of this particular
bug.)</li>
<li>The class was implemented as a subclass of
<tt>java.util.GregorianCalendar</tt>.  A Calendar exists soley to link
a <tt>java.util.Date</tt> and a <tt>java.util.TimeZone</tt>, but
Julian dates are all relative to UTC, so should not be represented as
a Calendar, much less a Gregorian Calendar.</li>
</ul>
<p>I managed to replace almost all the occurrances with
<tt>java.util.Date</tt>s, except for a couple of places where I needed
to group things by day in EST.  Those places I just created a new
<tt>java.util.GregorianCalendar</tt>, and used it to figure out where
to split my groups.  The algorithm to go from the Julian days and
milliseconds since noon to a <tt>java.util.Date</tt>, and back again
is fairly easily derivable from the formula:
</p>
<pre><code>date = (julianDate - JULIAN_START) * MILLIS_PER_DAY + julianMillis - MILLIS_PER_DAY/2</code></pre>
Solve for any one of the three lowercase variables, using a little
truncating-division, or a little modulo arithmatic to get rid of
unknown terms, and you’re good to go.  So please, if you’re dealing
with dates or times, don’t make this mistake, at least not where I
might run across it.
