Compared to the first half of this year, in the last couple of
months I've been reading like a demon!
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Dangerous Planet: Natural Disasters That Changed History</em>
by Bryn Barnard.</strong>  This is another book by the <em>Outbreak</em>
dude, and I didn't like it as much but probably just because I
have more of an affinity for disgusting pustulent diseases than I
do for scary natural (and other) disasters.  This book has the
same basic format; each chapter is dedicated to a different
disaster, describing how the disaster happened and how it
changed the course of history.  Among other things, Barnard
discusses the Great Fire of London and its effect on how buildings
and cities are constructed; the two (not one but two!) typhoons
which devastated the army of Kublai Khan and protected Japan
from invasion in the 1200s, leading to a certain sense of 
invincibility in the Japanese; and of course the classic
asteroid which wiped out the dinosaurs.
</p>
<p>
This book is beautifully designed and well-illustrated, clearly
written and informative.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Your Four-Year-Old: Wild and Wonderful</em> by
Louise Bates Ames</strong>.  I had to read this to see what it
had to say about four-year-olds, which my mom friends and I have
already observed are bossy and braggy as hell.  Ames agrees,
although she gives it a more positive spin; she says if you
can view your four-year-old's noisy, pushy arrogance with
as much amused detachment as you can muster the year will go
much more smoothly.
</p>
<p>
As usual the observations in this book are spot on, and very
helpful in distinguishing your child's personality from the
phases she's going through.  It gets a little dated sometimes
but that's part of the fun of it.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, the next book in the series is subtitled "Sunny
and Serene".  Hooray!
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Mac is Not A Typewriter</em> by Robin Williams</strong>.
I only read this because Blake had it out, and a lot of it was
stuff my brother taught me back in Grade 11 ("The Amiga is not
a typewriter!"); don't use underlines, don't use spaces when
you should use tab stops.  Williams also gets into fancy stuff
like Kerning, and she is very keen — perhaps
obsessively so — on curly quotes and em-dashes.  She uses 
some very strong words to describe straight quotes, words which
make me think I am dealing with an ill person and should perhaps
disregard her advice.  Really, they're quotation marks.
</p>
<p>
I am also leery— born perhaps of having been
introduced to computers through Unix in the early nineties — of
using non-ASCII characters, really ever, but especially in
email and on the web.  Williams even suggests using curly quotes
in filenames!  I'm sorry, I don't even use spaces in filenames.
That's craziness.  Excuse me, I am going to go and grow a long
beard now, and perhaps refrain from bathing for a few weeks.  I
must dust my green-screen ASCII terminal.
</p>
<p>
At the cottage last week I read <strong><em>Home Leave</em>
by Libby Purves</strong> which was fantastic and I loved it; it's
about four siblings, the children of a diplomat, who were hauled
all around the world when they were young.  It's about what home
means, and of course I related to the situation of having your
sibling as your only constant for your whole childhood.  There 
is a lot of talk of children and babies in the book and Purves 
writes so realistically and richly about children; they don't 
disappear or only feature as plot or characterization devices,
or worse just as noisy perplexing ciphers, as they so often do
in novels.  Purves knows how to write about how children
change you and affect you for better and for worse.  I loved the
characters and the stories and the ideas.  And
the ending; the ending was immensely satisfying.
</p>
<p>
I also read <strong><em>Pug Hill</em> by Alison Pace</strong>
which was pretty disappointing after the Purves.  This is a 
book about a thirty-one year old in Manhatten looking for 
love and sorting herself out.  The protagonist annoyed the
crap out of me with her whining and self-absorption and
judgementalness and immaturity, and she didn't get all that 
much better through
the book, although I think she was supposed to.  It was like
Bridget Jones in Manhattan, except blessedly free of talk about
dieting.

    <p>Ah, the city.  How I love it.  I’ve just gotten back from a trip to
the cottage my parents’ rented, and while the house is sort of lonely
with just me there, I’m really enjoying being able to flush the
toilet, and have a long shower, and run the air conditioning, and all
those other conveniences of modern life.  That’s not to say that I
didn’t enjoy the cottage.  I think I had more fun there this year than
I have since I was a kid, but it is still nice to be home.</p>

<p>I think the main trick will be keeping on top of everything so that
I’m not making a mad rush to get everything done on Sunday morning,
before Amy and the kids get home.  It’ll be an extra-special trick,
since Trevor’s on vacation this week, so I’ll be the lead server
developer for the two products that we’re trying to release in the
next week or so.  Ah, well.  It wouldn’t be fun without some stress,
right?</p>

I am having some kind of stupid birthday crisis.  As I was
loading the dishwasher this evening I was ruminating on how
aggravating it sometimes is to have to share every single
little bit of your life with someone else.  I had just answered
the door to a charming young lady wanting me to sponsor a 
child, and I said no because I know Blake doesn't want to 
donate money to charities until we're out of debt.  If it
was just up to me I would probably give a little bit every
month regardless of debt; it's not like malaria is going
to take a break while we pay off our reno.  After bidding 
the charity girl good luck I went back to loading the 
dishwasher, which I have to do Blake's way because Blake
unloads.  Fair enough, and all this is perfectly reasonable
—I am by no means faulting Blake here, I couldn't ask
for a better husband.  It just gets a little tired 
constantly having to consider someone else, or in my
case three someone-elses.
</p>
<p>
After I finished the dishwasher I followed a link from my
<a href="http://dagbrown.livejournal.com/">brother's blog</a>
to <a href="http://mccorpsecorpse.livejournal.com/">this dude's
blog</a> to <a href="http://tvtropes.org/">TV Tropes</a> where
I spent an enjoyable hour or more reading about <em>Buffy</em>
and <em>Firefly</em> and <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> (though
perhaps I should not have read those spoilers), and
I really miss good TV.  I miss watching thoughtful, 
well-written shows, and
I miss going to work the next day and discussing them with
smart people, either live or online (yes, I spent far too
much time discussing TV at work, and I guess I will have
to remove <em>that</em> admission from this space before
I look for another job).    I miss having the time and the
spare 
emotional and intellectual resources to dedicate to TV shows.
</p>
<p>
And somehow (there may be some hormones involved)
that particular nostalgia has snowballed
irrationally into missing the days when I had lots of time
to play on the Internet, when my life was spent in a shiny
air-conditioned condo on a busy street and I took a train
to work and played on computers all day.  Now suddenly
my life seems to be spent playing in the dirt with two
messy, demanding, noisy, emotional (why, oh why must they be
two and four at the same time!) little people who seem
to have no interest in discussing Marti Noxon's Season
Six intellectual breakdown, or whether there is any 
point in improving Internet security technology as long
as it is still possible to adhere a Post-It note with
your password written on it to the side of your monitor.
</p>
<p>
Oh, I miss grown-ups.  I miss them so much.  I miss
air conditioning.  I miss meetings.  I miss lists of 
things to do that don't involve zucchini.  I miss 
computers and filesystems and data and logical problems
and whiteboards and deadlines and lunch rooms and 
that idiotic conversation about where we should go
for lunch this week.  I miss being something other than
Mom ("mudder", she calls me) and homemaker.
</p>
<p>
Being Mom is something that will never change, but one
day it will involve less dirt and hopefully more conversations
about Marti Noxon.  (Or actually hopefully not, now that
I think about it.)  And one day I will go back to work
and they will probably have outlawed air conditioning by
then, but there will be computers and meetings and 
deadlines and I will soon refresh my hatred for all three
things.  Life is all about balance — you have to hate
lots of different things to be truly happy.

    <p>This started off as a reply to some email on the Bazaar-NG list,
but it sort of grew and grew, until there were a whole bunch of things
in it, and I thought it would probably be better as a weblog entry, so
that I could find it later.</p>

<p>On to the email...<br>
Martin Pool wrote:<br>
&gt; If you have sftp access to your server, then just do<br>
&gt;   bzr init-repo sftp://user@host/~/myproject<br>
&gt;   bzr push sftp://user@host/~/myproject/mybranch<br>
&gt; then on the second machine (eg at work)<br>
&gt;   bzr init-repo ~/myproject<br>
&gt;   cd myproject<br>
&gt;   bzr branch sftp://user@host/~/myproject/mybranch<br></p>

<p>As a related question, if I wanted other people to be able to download
my branch over http, would it suffice to do something on the server
like<br><br>
bzr init-repo ~/www/myproject<br>
cd ~/www/myproject<br>
bzr branch sftp://user@host/~/myproject/mybranch<br><br>
or would I need to push straight to ~/www/myproject/mybranch?
</p>

<p>I'm of two minds here, and I'ld like to explain why, in case it's a
common problem.  On the one hand, the repo I created by following the
steps in the first part of Martin's message<br>
&gt;   bzr init-repo sftp://user@host/~/myproject<br>
&gt;   bzr push sftp://user@host/~/myproject/mybranch<br>
should be just the same as any other repository, right?<br><br>
But, on the other hand, when I ssh to "user@host", and look in
~/myproject, all I see is a .bzr directory.  None of the files I
allegedly pushed.
</p>

<p>A search for 'bzr push "no content"' and 'bzr push missing files'
turns up nothing that makes much sense to me.  running 'bzr help push'
finally shows me the following lines:<br>
&gt; The target branch will not have its working tree populated
because<br>
&gt; this is both expensive, and is not supported on remote file
systems.<br>
which explains it at least a little.  So I started looking for a way
to push and update, which quickly led me to the push-and-update
plugin, but I'm now lost as to how to install it into my copy of bzr
(the binary distribution, running under Windows XP.)  The plugins
document that ships with bzr says "typically found in
/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/bzrlib/plugins/", but I'm really
fairly sure that's not where it's located on <i>my</i> box...  <a href="http://dpi.radiology.uiowa.edu/mifar/doc/bazaar-setup.php">another
page</a> says that it is "usually [...]
C:\python2.4\site-packages\bzrlib\plugins under Windows", but again,
that directory doesn't exist where I am.
</p>

<p>Since I expect it'll make a difference to any answer I get, let me
just say upfront that I've installed Bazaar (bzr) 0.18.0 into
C:\Program Files\Bazaar\ using the Windows standalone installer.  The
output of "bzr version" is:<br>
"""<br>
Bazaar (bzr) 0.18.0<br>
Using Python interpreter: C:\Program Files\Bazaar\bzr.exe<br>
Using Python standard library: C:\Program
Files\Bazaar\lib\library.zip<br>
Using bzrlib: C:\Program Files\Bazaar\lib\library.zip\bzrlib<br>
Using Bazaar configuration: C:/Documents and
Settings/blake/Application Data/bazaar/2.0<br>
Using Bazaar log file: C:\Documents and Settings\blake\My
Documents\.bzr.log<br><br>

bzr comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.  bzr is free software, and you
may use, modify and redistribute it under the terms of the GNU General
Public License version 2 or later.<br>
"""<br><br>
So, where should I put the plugins in this case?<br></p>

<p>The answer, as given on irc, seems to be "put it somewhere else and
set the BZR_PLUGIN_PATH env variable".  Works for me, although it
would have been nice if the Windows standalone installer did that for
me, by creating a Plugins directory under the install directory.  And
as one final note, the BZR_PLUGIN_PATH, which it may contain spaces
(i.e. "C:\Program Files\Bazaar\Plugins"), must not end in a trailing
"\".</p>

places that get as much snow as we sometimes do, and partially
because…  Well, I don’t know why else it might be so big.  Maybe just
because that was the scale of the space it had to take up.  <br clear="left"><a href="images/deck2007/0726c.jpg"><img align="left" src="images/deck2007/small/0726c.jpg" alt="Screen!" style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"></a>

And an old-new screen door.  This should get some air moving through
the house without my having to worry too much about finding a hornet
in my bed (again!)  And when the screen on the front gets installed,
it should be even sweeter.<br clear="all"></p>

It’s getting close...  The planters are done, and the garbage bin
(which seems larger than I thought it would be) is framed in.<br clear="left"><a href="images/deck2007/0724b.jpg"><img align="left" src="images/deck2007/small/0724b.jpg" alt="Stonehenge.  Kinda." style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"></a>

A closer-up view of one of the planters, along with the base to the
umbrella for the patio table, and the gas hookup for the barbeque.<br clear="left"><a href="images/deck2007/0724c.jpg"><img align="left" src="images/deck2007/small/0724c.jpg" alt="Stairs!" style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"></a>

And the inside of the garbage bin, with obligatory cat.<br clear="all">

Okay, so the comments were a little weak today, I’m recovering from a
severe arm wound, cut me some slack.

<strong><em>Extraordinary Evil: A Brief History of Genocide</em> by 
Barbara Coloroso</strong>.  Like so many of us, Coloroso has been
doing a sort of independent study of genocide and she came up
with the rather surprising, at first glance, theory that genocide
is bullying writ large.  I was pretty skeptical at first but
she sold me on her idea; she has done a lot of thinking about
bullying and she has her trademark bulleted lists on the topic
all figured out, and she manages to map them to genocide 
quite convincingly.  I'll probably check out her book on bullying,
and also a few of the books she refers to on genocide.  A few
of them were on my list before but I chickened out; maybe this
time I will have the guts to actually read them.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Outbreak: Plagues that Changed History</em> by
Bryn Barnard</strong> is actually a picture book which
I grabbed from the kids' section because I'm all about plagues
and gruesome diseases.  However, it's written at what seems
to me to be a very advanced level.  It is a fantastic book;
each chapter discusses one plague and its effect on society,
and the illustrations (also by the author) are lush.
</p>
<p>
I didn't actually read <em>The Assault on Reason</em> by Al 
Gore because I had it out of the library and I had to take
it back before I got more than a couple of chapters in.  However,
I was pleasantly surprised; in the chapters I read he got into
why people are so compelled by television, so it seems like he's
really getting into the very roots of why American politics is
so screwed up.  I have put myself on the hold list again (I am number 
249 of 267) and I look forward to having another crack at this
book.  Sometime in 2008.
