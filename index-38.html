                    <p>And today it all fell apart.  Instead of pre-preparing dinner when
Delphine was at kindergarten, I read my book, and watched The Daily
Show.  As a result, the salmon casserole was nowhere near ready at
5:00, and indeed, wasn’t ready until about 6:30.  So Delphine had
chicken noodle soup, billion-grain toast (I’m serious, there’s no
flour in this freakin’ bread.  It’s all just seeds and nuts packed
together somehow!), and some cherry tomatoes which my parents brought
over last night (in exchange for the apple cake and apple pie and ice
cream).  And after we went out for fish &amp; chips for lunch, too.
Thank god for the tomatoes, or I’ld feel like a completely bad
parent.</p>

<p>And now I’m off to read some more (by which I of course mean watch
some more TV), before turning in for the night.</p>

                    <p>Yeah, today is coming together much better than yesterday did.  I
just skipped the Starbucks, and came home from kindergarten, stopping
off at Valumart to pick up a couple of pie shells.  Oh, yeah, this
morning, Delphine and I made an apple cake, but our <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/sku3993557/index.cfm">bundt pan</a> wasn’t nearly large enough, so we were left with a ton
of apple filling.  I threw it into a (store-bought, shhh!) pie shell,
cut the other shell into strips, and made a nice lattice on top, and
I’m now baking it at 350º for 25 minutes.  (I totally guessed at the
time and temperature.  I suppose I should go look it up in Betty
Crocker, huh?  Damn, did I ever mess that one up!  Betty says 425º for
40-50 minutes, with foil around the edges and stuff.  Good thing I
checked.)  Easy-peasy (even with the foil).</p>

<p>Anyways, I think I’m going to end this entry now, and go sit on the
couch and read my book.  <span style="font-size:x-large">Mu</span><span style="font-size:large">hu</span><span style="font-size:medium">heheha</span><span style="font-size:small">hahaha</span><span style="font-size:x-small">haha</span><span style="font-size:xx-small">hahaaaaa</span>…</p>

                    <p>Ah, kindergarten.  After dropping Delphine off, I went to
Starbucks, grabbed myself a latte, and sat and started to read my
book.  Sadly, the presence of two wasps flying past my head sort of
ruined my quite interlude, and I headed on home.  When I was here, I
managed to check my email, increment the laundry (you all use that
term too, right?  When you put the stuff from the dryer into the
basket, the stuff from the washer into the dryer, and stuff from the
dirty hamper into the washer), and hang the wet load out in the
backyard.  Yeah, apparently when Amy isn’t home I get all domestic.
Who’lda thunk it?</p>

<p>But even given that, I really seem to have less free time than I
thought I would.  Somehow, between checking email and the various
household chores, I haven’t been able to read as much of my book as I
would have wanted, much less write the specs/code that I was hoping
to.  Ah well, perhaps I’ll get used to the routine by Friday, or maybe
I’ll just put those tasks on pause until I get back to work.</p>

                    <p>Today seemed a little more in control than yesterday.  I was really
slacking yesterday, doing as little housework as I could possibly
manage.  Today I got a load of laundry done, and hung up in the
basement, and I would be on my second load, but apparently the door
didn’t close, or something, and so the load was completely dry when I
went to check it after dinner.  Dinner was another thing I handled a
little better.  Since my father and sister were coming for dinner, I
made chili from around 3:00 until 4:00, and let it sit on the stove on
low, mellowing.  It turned out really well, I think, and there are some
leftovers.  Delphine and I also made some Rice Krispie Squares that
afternoon (I made them, she licked the various implements), so we had a
fun dessert as well.</p>

<p>I’m really looking forward to tomorrow, though, since I’ll have two
fairly large blocks of free time, in which to attempt to beat the house
into something approaching shape.  The kitchen really needs a cleaning,
there are three more loads of laundry to do.  (Four if you count the
failed attempt in the washing machine.)  In the morning, I’ve got to
make sure that Delphine has all the stuff she needs for kindergarten.
Okay, that’s not actually something I can do in the blocks of free time,
but I figured since I was listing all the stuff I need to get done, I
might as well just slip it in there.  And on that note, I think I’ll be
off to try and get another couple of things done before I head to
bed.</p>

                    <p>Amy and Cordelia left for Saskatchewan at 6:30 this morning, and so
Delphine and I got to spend the whole day together.  The first of
seven.  It’s going pretty well so far, I think.  We played together in
the park this morning: digging in the sand, flying kites, and kicking
a soccer ball.  We got home, and had some leftovers for lunch (grilled
cheese and pizza, both heated in the toaster over), then watched the
obligatory Charlie and Lola show, and read some books.  Ooh, we also
had banana/frozen-strawberry/milk smoothies for afternoon snack.  They
were really good, and a convenient way to get some fruit into our
bodies.  After hanging out a little, we went to the grocery store,
grabbed the week’s worth of groceries, and headed home.  So I thought
I’ld take a few minutes to write a quick blog entry while I’m cooking
dinner (frozen President’s Choice vegetable lasagna).</p>

<p>Dinner was tasty, and Delpine liked it, even though she started off
saying “I’ve had this before at daycare, and I don’t like it.”.  Then
we looked for recipes for apple cake, found one, and headed off to
bed.  And now I’m not entirely sure what I’m going to do for the rest
of the evening.  I suppose there’s a FIFA Women’s World Cup game I’ve
got taped, or I could watch a video about Haskell by Simon
Peyton-Jones, but I dunno, neither of those seem to really be grabbing
me.  Ah well, I’m sure I’ll figure something out.</p>

Damn, I didn't realize I hadn't posted pictures since April!  I guess
it serves me right that it took over three hours to 
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/">get them posted</a>
this evening. 
</p>
<p>
My only excuse for this and all my other website slacking (and
general life slacking) lately is that I have had both Delphine and
Cordelia home full-time since mid-May.  This Friday Delphine 
starts kindergarten in the afternoons, and next Tuesday Cordelia
starts morning nursery school two days a week, so perhaps I will
have more time to do things.  That's if I don't wear myself out
schlepping them around.  We'll see!

today, just after crossing the railroad bridge, heading on to
Summerhill, I noticed a man poking at his bicycle.  I stopped, and
asked if he needed a hand, and sure enough, he did.  He seemed to have
gotten his chain wedged around his <a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_bo-z.html#bottom">Bottom
bracket</a>, in such a way that the arms of the <a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_sp-ss.html#spider">Spider</a>
were attempting to push the top and bottom pieces of the chain
<i>through</i> the <a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ch.html#chainstay">chainstay</a>.  That obviously wasn’t working, so I grabbed my
multitool, and attempted to use the largest <a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_aa-l.html#allen">Allen key</a>
to try to lever it out.  When that too failed, I pulled out the one
tool in my collection I’ve never used: The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_tool">Chain Tool</a>.  After
a few tries, I eventually got the chain apart, after which it was an
not-so-easy matter of threading it out through the gap between the
spider and the chainstay, re-threading it onto the <a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ch.html#chainring">chainring</a>,
and re-connecting it.  As a final gesture of goodwill/parting gift, I
gave him my last 2007 <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/cycling/map/index.htm">Bike Map</a>.
(Yeah, I know the link is to the 2006 page.  They really have to
update that sometime...)  After all that, I got to the office 15
minutes late.  (Well, 15 minutes later.  I didn’t have a meeting or
anything, and our core hours don’t start until 10:00.)  But I’ve got
to say, that was 15 minutes well spent, since it made the rest of my

                    <p>I’ve recently started using <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">bzr</a> as my go-to version control
system, and as a newbie I’ve <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/bzr/BazaarNotes1.html">run
into a couple of small things</a> I’ld like changed.  Fortunately, bzr
is written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, and comes
with an extensive set of unit tests, so it was easy for me to jump
right in and add the feature I wanted.  To be honest, I started off by
writing it up as <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr/+bug/129299">a bug report</a>,
with a trivial patch (by which I mean one without any tests).  The
comments on the bug led me to write up an actual mergable set of
changes (which seems to be called a bundle by the bzr folks), and
submit it for review.  What followed was a few <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.bazaar-ng.general/29306/focus=29306">back-and-forths</a> where various people pointed out things I hadn’t
done correctly, or hadn’t really understood, and I fixed them.  As a
result, I think the code in <a href="http://bundlebuggy.aaronbentley.com/request/%3C46C303B4.60109%40latte.ca%3E">the most recent bundle</a> is pretty good, and is certainly far
better than anything I would have produced on my own.</p>

The girls and I just got back from a week at the cottage — Blake
was there for the first few days but he had to come back for work
mid-week.  We stayed a full week and had a great time.
</p>
<p>
We stayed on the same beach as last year, but in a different
cottage; this one was further up the beach on a rockier bit,
which meant we had to trek down the road a ways to get to 
the sandy swimming beach.  The beach we were on, though — the
backyard of the cottage— had a sandy part for sitting and
reading or digging in,
and also lots of rocks for climbing and collecting and sliding on,
so it was by no means a disaster.
</p>
<p>
The cottage had two bedrooms on the main floor and another
double bed and single bed up in the loft, a little room 
amateurishly cobbled together in the rafters, accessible
by a ladder-like staircase.  Blake and I and Delphine slept
there for the first weekend; after Morgan and Erik and Blake
left the girls and I moved into one of the main floor bedrooms
and I got to experience the quiet but deep satisfaction of 
falling asleep to the sound of my children's breath.
</p>
<p>
The place was pretty cottagy; I don't understand this love
of wood panelling.  Nostalgia, I suppose.  Zaida went to
scope out a different cottage for next year.  It had been
freshly gutted and decorated with, you guessed it, wood
panelling.  Nice, new wood panelling.  
I would slap gallons of white paint around
if I had one of these places.  This cottage did have some
of the midcentury furnishings I favour; two beautiful
pairs of wood armchairs in a fine, elegant Danish style.
I couldn't get Blake to see past the orange vinyl on
one pair and green tweed on the other to appreciate their
airiness and elegantly tapered legs, though.
</p>
<p>
We spent a lot of time on the beach.  I stupidly got sunburned
twice but the girls weren't at all; they are just a little tan.
Delphine was a superstar in the water; by the end of the week
she was getting bowled over by waves and just picking herself
up and facing the next one.  Perhaps this is more interesting if
you know what a fraidy cat she normally is!  It's satisfying
to see her face her fears and enjoy herself.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia wasn't so hot on the water; I think she doesn't like
to be cold.  I have lots of pictures of her looking variously
forlorn, miserable, cranky and disgruntled on the beach.
(I will post pictures soon.)
Cordelia did have some fun playing with Zaida in the waves, but 
Zaida is extremely good at finding the fun for little people.
</p>
<p>
We ate well; barbecued ribs, burgers, chicken, and hot dogs; freshly
picked corn on the cob, watermelon, ice cream, new potatoes,
field tomatoes.  Beer.  Every day we tried to eat up the leftovers and 
every night the fridge was fuller than ever.
</p>
<p>
Baba and Zaida had some friends over on the last night we were
there, two couples.  Delphine was very apprehensive about meeting
them, but when I exhorted her to be brave she pulled herself
together and both girls were very nicely behaved and charming.
Another fear conquered!
Delphine took it upon herself to take care of Cordelia; when
Cordelia said she was done eating Delphine wiped her up with a
napkin, very officiously.  Delphine was also very happy to 
show the guests down
to the lake.  As a special bonus I
got to talk to adults about brainy things like computers and
books.  Hooray!  I need to make some new friends, or perhaps
just reaquaint myself with the friends I already have.
</p>
<p>
So another successful trip to the cottage, and Zaida already
has next year's cottage picked out.  We refine our requirements
every year; by 2015 we will have identified the perfect cottage.
