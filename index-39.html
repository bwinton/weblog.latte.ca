    <p><img align="left" src="images/blake/OrangePalmLogo.gif"><img align="right" src="images/blake/GreyPalmLogo.gif">A few weeks ago, I
was reading a pdf file on my Palm TX, when all of a sudden, it reset
itself.  Now, if that was the end of this story, then it would have been
slightly annoying, but nothing to post about.  However, that’s nowhere
near the end.  After resetting itself, it came back to the initial
orange Palm logo, as seen on the left, then it switched to the grey
PalmPowered logo, as seen on the right.  And there it sat.  And sat. And
sat…  The only thing I could consistently do is reset it, and every time
I did, it ended up on the grey screen, sitting there.  Soft resets,
debug resets, hard resets, zero-out resets…  Nothing could get it to
move past the grey screen.  On the off chance it was just taking a long
time to do its thing, I left it sitting overnight.  In the morning, I
opened it up expectantly finding… the grey screen again.  I read on the
internet that it might fix this problem if I left it sitting without any
power for a week, so I did, and the next time I plugged it it?  Yeah,
grey screen.  My heart was broken.  What could I do?<br clear="all"></p>

<p>I could call <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/support/contact/canada_repair.html">Palm’s
tech support</a>, and get a replacement!  It’ld only be $35 to get them
to ship one.  But when I called I found that I was way out of warranty.
Like, a year out of warranty.  So I decided not to go that route, since
it would be $150 to get it fixed, (or $185 to get the advance exchange,)
and I just don’t have that kind of money kicking around.  Then I
remembered that I had bought an extended warranty from the store, good
for a year after Palm’s warranty had run out, until Boxing Day of this
year.  Excellent, now I can just trade it in for a new one at the store.
But, I couldn’t find the receipt from two years ago, nor could I find
the credit card bill.  So I’ld have to figure out a way of getting them
to honour the warranty without knowing the warranty number.  That was
going to be hard, but in theory they had my information in their big
database, so it should be possible.  On the Monday morning, I was
checking through our filing cabinet one last time before heading off to
the store, and in the midst of a bunch of other receipts, (Why are we
keeping receipts for two year old meat purchases, anyway?  I’m pretty
sure that at this point, even if the meat was bad, we couldn’t return
it.) I found it!  So now, with all my ducks in a row, I left for the
store, <a href="http://www.compusmart.com/">Compusmart</a> at Yonge and
King.</p>

<p>Arriving at the store, I was slightly surprised to find the doors
locked, and a notice up from the landlord, saying that this location was
closed.  Apparently, some time in the past two years, Compusmart had
decided to close all of its Ontario locations.  Well, great.  What the
heck do I do now?  Getting to the office, I hit the internet, found a
phone number, got redirected to a different phone number, and then spoke
with someone who checked my warranty number (convieniently printed on my
two-year-old receipt), and said that they’ld send me some email which I
should sign and fax back.  Since there were no more Compusmart stores
left in Ontario, they couldn’t exchange the merchandise, and so they
were going to buy it back from me for the purchase price of $400!  I was
elated, until I realized that, because I had already done an early
exchange on this unit with Palm to fix an unrelated problem, the serial
number on the back of the TX was different than the one they had on
file.  And I bet that’s the sort of thing you would check if you were
going to send out a $400 cheque.  I called them back, and asked what I
should do.  They replied that I would need to get some sort of proof
from Palm that I had traded in the one unit for the other.  After
another set of phone calls and emails, I eventually got a PDF from Palm,
listing the date, and the early advance exchange, and the two serial
numbers, which I proceeded to forward off to the warranty company.  And
now I’m waiting for them to update my policy and send me their buyout
agreement so that I can fax it back to them, send them my Palm TX, and
get my $400.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I’ve got one of those problems people don’t mind
having.  I’m trying to figure out what to spend the money on.  Should I
get another Palm TX, with infrared keyboard, for <a href="http://www.softmagic.ca/_e/Palm/product/1047ML%2DBP3/%0APalm_TX_PDA_Handheld_w_WiFi_Free_Wireless_Keyboard.htm">$300</a>?
Basically replace my current setup, and pocket the extra $100?  Or
should I get something <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/canadastore.woa/">a little newer</a>?  That back there is supposed to be a link to the
iPod Touch. Specifically, the 16 Gig version.  (It’s really not, but
let’s pretend it was.)  It’s going for $449, which is a fair bit more
than I’m getting a cheque for, but…  If I go to the <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/">
American Apple Store</a>, I see that the price for the 16 Gig version
there is only $399 USD, or around $373 Canadian.  (Remind me, again, why
I’m paying $70 ($80 USD!) more for stuff just because I live in Canada?
Honestly, people, fix your freaking prices already!) And I know people
in the States who would be more than happy to ship it to me.  Heck, some
of them might even be coming up here for Christmas, and could just pack
it in their luggage.  Uh, where was I?  Oh, yeah, do I stick with the
devil I know, or do I go for the devil I don’t know?  I was leaning
towards the Palm TX recently, because there’s <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=2007092413051689">no
text editor/note taker</a> for the iPod Touch, and you <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/10/apple-confirms-ipod-touch-cannot-add-appointments/">can’t create appointments</a> in the Calendar
app, two things I kind of do a lot of.  But today I read about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mobiletextedit/">a text editor</a>, and a
<a href="http://www.modmyifone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=9507">way to
enable</a> the missing add-appointments feature.  Then I was worried
that the best way to view a PDF would be <a href="http://www.aimersoft.com/tutorial/download-dvd-pdf-youtube-videoto-ipod.html">to convert it to text</a>, but <a href="http://www.modmyifone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2665&amp;page=2">maybe not</a>.</p>

<p>I think the thing that finally convinced me was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/weboo/1547734040/">this picture</a>.
Yeah, I’m a huge geek.  What can I do?  (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/weboo/1557567120/">This picture</a>
didn’t hurt either.)</p>

Our neighbourhood loves Hallowe'en.  At least half of the 
houses, it seems, are decorated, and the sidewalks were so
thick with trick or treaters last night that most people
weren't even bothering to close their doors between
visitors.  On our block most of our neighbours were sitting
on the front porch steps chatting; some with wine, some
without.
</p>
<p>
We decorated our house with three pumpkins (remember when
one jack o' lantern was enough?) and three bats made from
our leftover NDP campaign sign, painstakingly cut out and
coloured with black magic marker.  We also used the 
uprights upon which said sign was mounted to string a 
spiderweb to which I glued a spider, also made from
the sign.  (I decided I wasn't going to buy anything
last month so we had to make our own decorations from
whatever we had at hand.  Thank goodness there had been
an election!)  It all looked pretty awesome,
and all the more satisfying since we didn't just buy it
at the dollar store.  I guess today I should
take it all down.
</p>
<p>
Last night Cordelia was dressed as a bumblebee, with 
yellow and black
tights and a pair of sparkly wings.  (The headband with 
antennae came off pretty early and Morgan and I ended
up wearing it.)  She loved trick or treating, and she
wouldn't let anyone else hold her bag of candy even when
it was almost too heavy for her to carry.  She learned
to say "t'ick a t'eat!" and "t'anks!" right away.  Well,
with prompting.
</p>
<p>
Delphine was a bunny, with fluffy ears, a beige hoodie (bunnyhug!) 
and a cottontail sewed to her white skirt.  She was into
trick or treating until she hit the Brick Wall of Sleepiness
at around 7:15 and refused to get off the 
<a href="http://www.lascal.se/html/kb_models01.aspx">kiddy 
board</a> until we got home.  Cordelia trick or treated
at a couple of different houses after that and when Delphine
was asked if she wanted some candy she said "No thanks."
When that kid is tired, she is tired.
</p>
<p>
After we got home and sorted through Delphine's candy,
and ate some, we put the girls to bed (an hour late!)
Then Blake and I picked through their respective booty
and set aside the thirty most succulent (and safe, and
appropriate) pieces (one for
each day in November) for each girl, and kept the rest for ourselves!
Well, Blake will take them to work and fatten up his
colleagues.  Then we sat and watched <em>Band Candy</em> and
ate chocolate until we were done eating chocolate.  Which,
for reference, means we ate a lot of chocolate.  Mmmm...

The other day I went with Delphine's class on a field trip
to the Toronto Botanical Gardens.  I was put in charge of
Delphine; Annie, with long blonde hair in a messy ponytail and
huge blue Cindy Loo Who eyes; and Alyssa, tiny and cheerful
and not particularly inclined to stay with the group.
</p>
<p>
After all the festivities of looking at leaves and planting
garlic cloves and holding compost worms, we all stopped for
a snack.  The children got granola bars, but I had packed myself
an apple because I knew I would be hungry too.  (I eat like a 
little kid, lots of snacks.)  Alyssa asked what kind of apple
it was.
</p>
<p>
"It’s a Honeycrisp.  I haven't tried them before but I really
like it; it's crispy and juicy and sweet.  We usually get Royal Gala."
</p>
<p>
"We get Honeycrisp," said Alyssa.  "I like them."
</p>
<p>
"We get Golden Russet," said Annie.  I asked if she liked
them and she said she did.  "They're brown and the skin is
kind of rough."
</p>
<p>
I said I would try them next time I bought apples, but
they didn't have any at the grocery store yesterday.
</p>
<p>
Isn't that a weird conversation to have with four and five
year-olds?  I guess that's when you get when you live in
a neighbourhood of foodies.

The other day Delphine peered intently at the world map
we got for my birthday for a while, and then announced
"I read San!  S-a-n is San!"  That's the first word she
has read apart from her name and a few words that she'd
memorized like "o-f-f off" and "n-o no".  And it's in
Spanish!  She's bilingual!
</p>
<p>
Then later she read the first syllable of "Doritos", which
is now that I think about it, faux-Spanish.  I'm going to
assume that's a coincience until I get more data.  Anyway
the point is she's almost reading!  Hooray!

Delphine is four years and five months old, and she just
started Junior Kindergarten.  She's in a mixed JK/SK class
and she loves it.  When people ask if she likes Kindergarten
she says "Fun!"  That seems to take them by surprise.
</p>
<p>
On the first day of Kindergarten Delphine didn't cry or
cling, she marched right in there with, literally, not
a backward glance.  (I actually had to call her back 
for a kiss.)  I guess all that daycare paid off.
</p>
<p>
When I went to pick her up she said "I have
a new best friend!"  When I asked her name, Delphine
didn't know.  Ah well.  It's now a few weeks later and
she knows the names of everyone in her class.  In fact,
the other day we were at the grocery store when some
little boy in a grocery cart said "Hi Delphine!"  It's
really weird when your kid all of a sudden knows people
you have barely heard of, let alone met.
</p>
<p>
It's taking a while for us to get into the new routine
after a long summer of sloth.  Summer was lovely; we
spent our time in the garden, going to the library,
going to music class, watching the deck being built,
sitting on the deck, generally just kicking around.  Delphine 
had so little to do that she spent her time growing:
altogether she has grown four and a half centimeters since
her birthday.  I was measuring her every two weeks!
</p>
<p>
Delphine wants to be a paleontologist.  She is all about dinosaurs
lately; one of the main activities on Thanksgiving was making a
cardboard model of a stegosaurus with Auntie J'Anne.  She knows, well,
plenty of the most popular dinosaurs (your Tyrannosaurus, your
Stegosaurus, your Apatosaurus, your Ankylosaurus, and so on) and the
December 15th re-opening of the dinosaur gallery at the ROM is a
red-letter day in our calendar.  This seems to have ameliorated the
princess thing somewhat, thank heaven.  Now she waffles between
being a fairy princess or being a parasaurolophus for Hallowe'en.
</p>
<p>
Delphine's getting really good at riding her bike.  Not really riding,
of course, she still has training wheels, but she can keep up a pretty
good clip and she doesn't tend to fall over at <em>every</em> curb.  I
don't let her get much practice because I am a mean and lazy mum and I
don't want to bother with carrying a helmet and locking up the bike
and hanging on to her crossing streets while pushing Cordelia, and
stuff.   But somehow she has still managed to improve, and I harbour
hope that she will magically learn to ride safely without any practice
at all.  Or maybe I will get Blake to take her out.
</p>
<p>
Delphine still loves to be read to.  We just bought a whole
pile of Robert Munsch books which are a hit, plus a few Sam and
Stella books (by Marie Louise Gay) which both Delphine and
Cordelia love.  (I love Scholastic.  They do sell some crap, but
their good deals are great.)  We also plough through some 
incredibly advanced dinosaur books; I don't know how much is
sinking in, but she sits and listens for ages.  Incidentally,
I just got a picture book about the latest dinosaur science;
sort of an "everything you thought you knew about dinosaurs
is wrong!" kind of thing.  I am a little conflicted about
reading it to her; on the one hand I know I love to have the
latest information about things.  On the other hand I know it
takes the wind out of my sails to know that all those pictures
of Apatosaurs with their heads up in the air are wrong.  It's
kind of depressing, like what else in this book is wrong?  But
then that's science; if we wanted certainty we would read her
Bible stories.
</p>
<p>
On that note I am going to go sit on the couch and eat sweet potato
pie.  I love pie.  (But not as much as Delphine!  We were having pie
the other day and she said she loves it more than cake.  The Cake or
Pie war continues.  Don't worry, cake, <em>I</em> will never put you second to
pie.) </p>

A couple of months ago Blake and I were just settling into bed
at around 11:00.  Just as we were dropping off to sleep we heard
the familiar <em>Thud.  Creak.  Thud thud thud thud thud</em> of
Delphine getting out of bed and coming down the hall to our room.
She came in and stood silently on Blake's side of the bed.  
Finally he asked, "What do you need, Delphine?"
</p>
<p>
"Choux pastry!"
</p>
<p>
Silence, then, "Would you like me to tuck you back into bed?"

Cordelia turned two on Thursday, which was kind of sucky for
her because it was her fourth day of nursery school and so she's
still suffering from lots of separation anxiety.  I felt like
a monster leaving her crying and miserable in the arms of
Lakeisha the teacher on her birthday, but when I waved at her
through the window on the way out she was already smiling a
little bit.  They made up for it by giving her cake because 
it just happened to be the day for their September birthday
celebration.
</p>
<p>
Altogether, counting the nursery school party, Cordelia had
four birthday parties; one last weekend at Baba and Zaida's
with a chocolate cake and presents, one on Thursday night
at home with a plain cake with pink icing and more presents 
— we got her one of those rugs with roads and railways
and stuff printed on it (Delphine's idea), and <em>Hop on 
Pop</em> — and yet another this weekend when we 
made a dinosaur-shaped cake just for the fun of it.  We
like cake, what can I say?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nursery school</strong> is going well.  I signed 
her up not to give myself a break — I think it's
actually created more work for me — but because I thought
it was time she started to have a life of her own, to
gain some independence away from me, and to be exposed
to all the rich and interesting things they offer at 
nursery school.  It seems to be a really good facility;
they always have lots of interesting activities set
up when we get there in the morning, the teachers are
lovely, they have a real music teacher with a guitar
in every other week, and every week they take a picture
of your child and save it in a portfolio that you get
to keep at the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
The only catch is that the school is about one and a
half kilometers from home, around a fifteen minute
walk.  I originally thought it was going to be a longer walk than
that, before I actually tried it, so I was quite pleased.
On Thursday I strapped on my running shoes and put the
girls in the expensive but very cool jogging stroller /
bike trailer and ran up there, which of course also 
took about fifteen minutes because I am that slow and
also running with a stroller sucks.  But it's better 
than running at 7:30 at night when all I want to do is
collapse on the couch.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia can <strong>count to twenty</strong>, which
is kind of odd for a two-year-old.  She loves to count,
but she's not really counting <em>per se</em>.  I think 
she knows about counting in some sense; she knows you
do it when you have a lot of something, and that you 
count for a while and then stop and the number you stop
at means something, but she really doesn't map the 
actual number of things to the words she's saying. She
loves to over-count and usually ends up with "seven" 
of whatever it is.  Also when people ask her how old
she is she says "three!"  She just likes numbers.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, Delphine's friend Ursa also loved 
counting and numbers, to the extent that she still
calls both letters and numbers "numbers". This is
interesting because Delphine used to call numbers
"letters".  Shall we typecast them as the Wordy One
and the Mathy One already?
</p>
<p>
Cordelia <strong>talks in full sentences</strong>, 
and she has reached
that age when she comes out with syntactically perfect
sentences which leave me speechless.   "Help me put
 my sweater on!"  I hear it and it's a perfect sentence,
and then I realize it came from my tiny baby!
 She doesn't do full sentences all the 
time, though. Mostly she's still trying to cobble together
communication with the few words and bits of grammar she knows,
backed up with pointing and when all else fails, shouting
really loud.
</p>
<p>
Communicating is complicated by the fact that she 
<strong>doesn't
know her colours</strong> yet; when Delphine was this age at
least we could figure out what she wanted by saying, "What 
colour is it?"  Cordelia, for whatever reason, can't get
her colours straight.  For a couple of weeks everything
was blue ("bah-loo!") and now things seem to be mostly
red.  If you drill her you can get her to get a colour
right for a few minutes but then if you go back to it
later, she goes back to guessing.  I find this rather
perplexing; she doesn't seem to have trouble learning the
words for anything else.  Either she can't map the colours
to the names, or she can't distinguish the colours for
some reason.  Anyway, you aren't really expected to know
your colours until you're three or even four, so maybe 
there is some mental or visual development yet to come
which will resolve this.  In the meantime all the grandparents
have made it their mission to help her learn colours.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia <strong>sleeps</strong> from about six thirty
until six thirty or seven in the morning.  Well, I put
her to bed at six thirty; usually she stays awake talking
and singing to herself until seven.  She also naps from
one until two or two thirty.  (I got all my sleep advice 
from <em>Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child</em> by
Marc Weissbluth, so if you want a narcoleptic child and
a rich adult-only evening life you should read it too.)
She scared me on Friday by not napping at all; I wondered
if she had decided that since now she's two she doesn't
need a nap.  But then she napped yesterday and today, so
I think I still have a napper.  It's nice because she
naps while Delphine is in kindergarten, so I get some time
to get stuff done in the afternoons.  If I am not too tired
to think; afternoon is not my brightest time.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia has <strong>peed in the potty</strong> exactly twice, both times
under the tutelage of Baba.  I suppose she is more or less
ready to be properly potty-trained, which is exciting in
the sense of no more diapers, but I am not looking forward
to the process, the constant trips to the potty and 
interrogation regarding her need for the same.  "Do you have
to go pee?  Do you have to poo?  Do you want to sit on the
potty?"  However, it has to happen sometime!  The nursery
school teachers say they are happy to help, so maybe I
will rope them in and see if we can get it over with.
That would be awesome.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow is Monday, and October, and I have a million
things to do so I had best get to bed so I am not tired
and grumpy all day.

    <p>If anyone out there has been trying to email <a href="http://arbrown.latte.ca/">Amy</a> or I, we haven’t gotten it.
While I was home alone with Delphine, I subscribed to a few podcasts
in iTunes, so that we would have a ton of new music to listen to, but
when I went back to work, I forgot to unsubscribe, and as a result
filled up my entire hard drive with music and videos.  This caused a
bunch of things to fail for various reasons, the most notable of which
being that no-one has recieved any email for the past few days.  I can
only hope that the various mail servers around the world will continue
trying to send the messages, but if there’s something urgent that you
really wanted a response to, you might consider re-sending it.</p>

Cordelia and I are back from Saskatchewan so Blake's adventure
in single parenthood is over.  He was obligingly overwhelmed by
it — “I hardly had any time to read at all!”, and that's
with only one kid, and the easy one at that.  Yeah, keeping house
and raising babies is, in fact, a lot of work.  Who knew?  I am
only kind of being sarcastic here; I used to think I would feel
guilty about staying home until I realized how much damn work it
is.
</p>
<p>
But anyway, Saskatchewan.  We went to visit my parents, and the
timing was good because my dad just went into a nursing home
so my mom needed help with getting him settled in and getting
the house sorted out so she can manage on her own.  We cleaned
and sorted and went out for lunch and shopped (as much as you
can shop in Big River); it was a regular ladies' week.  Cordelia
was a huge hit with my mum; they read the Sears catalog and 
watched TV and looked at all the stuff my mum has.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia and I visited my dad at the home every day, and Cordelia
was a huge hit with the grannies and grandpas, with her big grin
and very loud observations.  “Dinosaur there!”  “See fishies!”
She also pulled out all the grandbaby stops on the last day
and gave my dad lots of nice hugs and kisses.
</p>
<p>
So there is a huge blog entry just waiting to be written, 
about this summer and how Delphine and Cordelia are doing,
about my thirty-second birthday;  all that narcissistic 
blather you have come to expect from this blog.  Whether I
will ever get around to writing that entry is yet to be
seen, but I have high hopes for this next month, what with
school and all.

    <p>I have no idea what happened to last night’s update.  Well, that’s
not entirely true.  I was at a FogBugz demo given by <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a>, and Delphine
had a sleep-over at her Baba and Zaida’s, so I took the time to write
<a href="http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/2.0/plans/archiveaccess.html">a spec</a>, and that led me to whip out a bunch of code.  The spec is
written in something called <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html">reStructuredText</a> (uh, that’s the link to the spec, which probably
<i>isn’t</i> the best way to learn about it, but <i>is</i> the
document I’ve been using the most), but my favourite Mac text editor
(<a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/index.shtml">TextWrangler</a>) doesn’t support it in any way, shape, or form.  So
I started writing <a href="http://bzr.latte.ca/files/restwrangler/head">a plugin</a> that
would teach TextWrangler what the heck reStructuredText was.  (You can
apparently get a tarball of the project from <a href="http://bzr.latte.ca/tarball/restwrangler/3">this link</a>, if
you’re so inclined, or if you’re not, you could just try <a href="static/blake/reST.dmg">the compiled plugin itself</a>.  Just
double-click the .dmg file, then double-click the .bblm file inside of
it, and it’ll tell you what to do.  Or mail me, and I will.)</p>

<p>So yeah, a busy, busy night, but I got to sleep in until 7:00,
which was really nice.  Today was more of the same, except it was
really hot out when Delphine got out of kindergarten, so instead of
playing in the school playground, Delphine and I decided to go to <a href="http://www.torontolife.com/guide/food/dairies/hollywood-gelato/">Hollywood Gelato</a>, the local ice cream store.  Tasty.  Tomorrow
Amy gets home, so it’s looking like it’ll be a pretty busy day as
well.</p>
