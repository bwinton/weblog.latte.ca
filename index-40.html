                    <p>Well, it’s official.  I just cancelled my cable service, effective
January 23rd.  I found that for the past few weeks, I really haven’t
been watching anything worth while, and $96.22/month is a lot to spend
to have the only thing on be the HD version of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/American_Gladiators/">American
Gladiators</a>.  (No, seriously, that’s what I’m watching right now.
Pity me.)  I’ld like to say that it’s the writer’s strike, and the
resulting lack of decent shows, or that I’m getting smarter and the
shows are appealing to me less and less, but really it’s just gotten
too expensive for the value I’m getting out of it.  Heck, maybe I’ll
take half of that money, and buy a couple of DVDs every month.  But
we’ll probably use it to pay down the Line of Credit that financed the
deck.</p>

<p>I can’t remember the last time I didn’t have cable of some sort,
and so I’m not really sure how I’ll be occupying my time.  Reading
books?  Reading the Interweeb?  Programming?  It’s a blank slate.
It’s all up in the air.  And if I end up spending all my time at my
sister’s house, watching her TV, then we’ll know I’ve got a bad
addiction, and should seek professional help.</p>

<p>Oh, I should also mention that the person on the other end of the
line was <i>really</i> nice.  She tried to figure out a way for me to
pay less, and still get the channels I wanted, (the best deal was
$19.95/month for channels 2-28 and 59-70, but that was only for 6
months, and it’s still $20/month I would rather spend elsewhere,) but
totally wasn’t pushy about it and was fine with me cancelling the
service outright.  I picked up the dial phone when they called me back
for the customer satisfaction survey, and so couldn’t complete it, but
I did want to make a mention of how helpful she was, and how well it
all went.</p>

                    <p>On Friday and Saturday afternoon this week, I took some time out of my
day to go down to the University of Toronto and participate in the <a href="https://www.drproject.org/">DrProject</a> <a href="https://www.drproject.org/DrProject/mail/5059">Code Sprint</a>.  It
was a lot of fun, and I managed to fix a couple of bugs, and get a better
understanding of one of <a href="https://www.drproject.org/DrProject/browser/trunk/drproject?file=wiki">the hairier parts</a> of DrProject.  At least I hope it’s one of the
hairier parts of DrProject, since if the whole codebase is as ugly as the
wiki parts, we’re in some serious trouble.  To be fair, it’s a
not-entirely-deterministic parser for a not-entirely-deterministic
language, so when something goes wrong, it’s kind of, uh, tricky to figure
out what’s just happened.  For example, after parsing a link surrounded in
square brackets, the following character seems to be <a href="https://www.drproject.org/DrProject/ticket/1075">treated as
text</a>.  Why?  Who knows.  As someone new to the wiki parser, I’ld love
to have the code be simpler to understand, but I’m starting to suspect that
the complexity is inherent in what it’s trying to do.</p>

<p>The two bugfixes/feature additions I did, although they seem sort of unrelated, both work
together to let people create a bibliography/set of footnotes to pages,
which is something <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/">Greg</a> said
that he’s been wanting for a while, so that was kind of cool.  It’s nice to
be able to go somewhere, be surrounded by smart people, and concentrate on
making something better without interruptions.</p>

<p>Speaking of the bugfixes, they were:
  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.drproject.org/DrProject/ticket/870">adding
support for dl/dt/dd</a> in the wiki syntax, which turned out to be
surprisingly hard, since it seemed to be the first bit of syntax that
wanted to either return more than one tag or insert a tag into the
already-generated stream, so I had to figure out which option to go with,
and how to get it working, and</li>
    <li>coming up with and implementing a wiki syntax for <a href="https://www.drproject.org/DrProject/ticket/1038">creating and referring to anchors</a> in a page, which I think I did a
pretty decent job on.  The syntax uses [wiki:#foo] as an anchor, and
[wiki:MyPage#foo] as a link to that anchor</li>

                    <p>I’m watching a video on my new iTouch about how to break web
applications, and it presented the idea that Javascript is the same as
stack overflows which are also the same as getting free phone calls by
whistling a note into a payphone…<br>
They're all examples of bad things happening when you intermingle code
(javascript/return addresses/command tones) and data (html/arrays on
the stack/your voice).  I guess it’s sort of expensive to set up two
connections for every connection, but that seems to be the only way to
avoid stuff like this, which has apparently been happening for
years.</p>

<p>I don’t think there’s a lot I can do with this new idea, but it
seemed interesting, so I figured I’ld record it for posterity.</p>

<p>Doing a bit of googling led me <a href="http://gegis.itsmart.fr/trac/browser/trunk/packaging/iphone/README.iPhone?rev=346">here</a>

<p>So, that's a little surprising.</p>

<p>I tried to install easy_install, to try an "easy_install pyexpat", but
because I'm missing a Makefile, that fails with the following:</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, and I ended up going with the iPod Touch (hereafter
referred to as the iTouch) to replace my Palm TX.  It's not the
perfect device, as the above stack traces show, but it's pretty good,
and a fair bit closer than the Palm TX was.</p>

I am feeling overwhelmed these days, recently by the holidays but
even before that by the structure and stricture imposed by having
to get the girls to their various schools.  For some reason I 
thought having the girls at school would mean more free time
for me, but as it turns out, not so much.  All this to say that
unfortunately blogging has dropped down to the bottom of my
priority list, somewhere below cleaning the toilet and flossing,
although above sweeping the basement floor and writing letters
to politicians.  This is mainly unfortunate not because I am
depriving you, my public, of my wisdom, but because the girls
are so damn charming these days and it's a pity I'm not writing
it down because I'm sure they will go through less charming 
periods and it would be nice to have this stuff to reminisce
about.
</p>
<p>
One of my problems is that there is so much to write about:
what Cordelia's like, what Delphine is like, what my life
is like, Delphine's identity issues (why must a four-and-a-half
year old have identity issues!), the weather, the neighbours'
tacky plastic light-up nativity lawn ornaments.  I have to choose
something.
</p>
<p>
So here's what our days are like.  Sometime in the morning
Cordelia wakes up, usually between six and six-thirty.  By
this time Delphine is mysteriously already in bed with us.
She used to get in bed on Blake's side — he would snuggle
with her and then take her back to bed.  Then he started
complaining about that because he finds it really hard to
get back to sleep after an interruption, whereas I can usually
drop right back off again.  Fine, I said, Delphine should
come and see me when she wakes up in the night.  Which is
apparently every night.  So we got her to do that.  The 
only problem is, I sleep so soundly that I don't even wake
up and she ends up sleeping with us all night, which wouldn't
bother me but apparently we crowd Blake.  Not sure
what the resolution to this problem is, but I hope when 
Delphine gets  her new bed and comforter she will stay in
her own bed.  Maybe we'll make a rule or something.
</p>
<p>
So anyway, Cordelia wakes up, sometimes crying and sometimes
singing.  She's still sleeping in a crib, so I get up and
get her and she comes back to the big bed for a "snuggle", 
meaning she nurses for a bit, yes she's still nursing, we're
going to stop any time now!  Really!  Usually Delphine and
Cordelia get into a bit of a spat because Cordelia's hitting
Delphine (she likes to thump something while she's nursing,
or kick something) or because Delphine said "Hi Cordelia" and
Cordelia didn't say hi back, or something.  Delphine's often
a bit testy in the morning.  Sometimes she's really gorgeous
and cheery and patient with Cordelia; I never know which
Delphine I'm going to get.
</p>

Anyway, after all the foolishness with the snuggling and
fighting is over, Delphine and Cordelia take their leave and
Blake and I grab a few more minutes of blissful rest.  The
girls used to go off and play but I found it hard to get them
to focus on getting dressed and coming for breakfast after
they had gotten into a game, so a few weeks ago I imposed a
rule that states that you have to be dressed before you can
play, and if you play before you are dressed I will confiscate
whatever you are playing with for the rest of the day.  I am
so mean.  It works, though, they get dressed now.  Delphine
dresses herself and then she helps Cordelia get dressed.
Sometimes Cordelia looks pretty wild; the other day she was
dressed in a blue, pink and green horizontal-striped shirt,
a shades-of-pink diagonal striped summer dress over top, and
her black and yellow striped bee tights from Hallowe'en.  I
guess to a 4.5 year old, three kinds of stripes qualifies as
matching.  Cordelia doesn't care what she wears yet, except
some days when she mysteriously insists on one particular
garment.
</p>
<p>
Once the girls are dressed they and I stumble downstairs
and I throw together some breakfast, usually toast or cereal.
I always feel that there should be some other food groups,
maybe fruit, but I can't face fruit first thing in the morning —
too tangy —  so I always forget to offer it to the girls.  I
should perhaps try a little harder.
</p>
<p>
If it's a Tuesday or Thursday then Cordelia has nursery
school, so there is usually a moderate rush to get out the
door.  Nursery school is a fifteen minute walk away; fifteen
minutes there plus fifteen minutes back, twice, makes an
extra hour of walking, twice a week, which is great for my
waistline but kind of messes up my schedule, especially around
lunchtime, but I will get to that.
</p>
<p>
If Cordelia has school, we drop her off by nine and then Delphine
have the morning to ourselves.  It would be nice if we spent
that time with quality bonding activities like reading or playing
at the park or, I don't know, tennis or something, but in
reality usually I have a million errands to run on the way
home, then we get home and I have a bunch of chores to do before
we turn around and go pick up Cordelia at 11:30.
</p>
<p>
If Cordelia doesn't have school we typically just putter around
the house; the girls do colouring or sticking, or they build things
with blocks, or they make train tracks, or they do imaginary
things with dollies.  They also like to disassemble the sofa and
use its cushions to make forts or big piles, especially in combination
with the plexiglass nesting side tables I bought at Caban years
ago.  I didn't imagine at the time that 
they would one day become houses and tunnels and  beds.
</p>
<p>
While the girls are playing I'm usually doing jobs; neverending
laundry, sweeping, cleaning the kitchen, more laundry.  Sometimes
I clean the bathroom.  I'm sure there are lots of other housework
activities I should be doing, but somehow I never get to them
between walking people places, doing laundry and cooking.
</p>
<p>
If it is Tuesday or Thursday at 11:30 and 
we have just picked Cordelia from school, we have to hurry home
to have lunch in time to turn around and go back out the door to
take Delphine to school by 12:45.  Now that it's winter and we
have to do the snow pants/jacket/boots/hat/mitts/scarf thing
our turnaround time is fairly long and there's not a lot of time
for making and eating lunch.  Lunchtime on Tuesdays and Thursdays
is not pretty at my house, and it often involves peanut butter
sandwiches.  It's a complete protein!
</p>
<p>
After Delphine is safely deposited at school, it's time for
Cordelia's nap.  She's usually tucked in by 1:20 and then I
have almost an hour and a half of unaccompanied time yawning
ahead of me.  This would be more exciting if there weren't
the fairly predictable round of laundry and sweeping and 
tidying to do, but sometimes I catch a short nap, or read
a bit, or even play on the internet for a while.  (It has taken
me four sessions to write this entry, and I am only finishing
it today because the girls are at Baba and Zaida's for supper.)
</p>
<p>
I almost always have to wake Cordelia up at 2:45 to give
her time to get her wits about her and have something to eat
before we leave to pick up Delphine at 3:15.  Delphine plays
in the schoolyard with her friends for a while and we're
back home by 4:00, whereupon I make dinner which we eat at
5:00 (no, it doesn't take me an hour to make dinner but I
have to give myself an hour to deal with interruptions and
crises on the way).  Bathtime happens around 5:45, followed 
by bedtime (pajamas, teeth, books and tucks)
and if we're lucky everyone is snug by 
7:00.  7:30 at the latest.  Blake usually gets home sometime
in the middle of bedtime, which the girls think is great
because he always has time to snuggle with them in the 
big bed, or read an extra book.
</p>
<p>
That's when the real fun begins, or so the girls suspect.  In
reality the evening involves clearing up after supper,
cleaning the kitchen, more laundry, any other chores that
absolutely can't be completed with children present (like
wrapping Christmas gifts!), and
then finally we can collapse in front of the TV for a few
minutes (maybe hours) until I have to
get to bed, which is before ten or else I am too crabby the next day.
Here's what we watch on TV these days: <em>Dirty Jobs</em>, 
<em>Chuck</em>,
<em>America's Funniest Home Videos</em>, <em>Battlestar
Galactica</em>, <em>The Tudors</em>, <em>Kid Nation</em>
(until it ended), and sometimes <em>Design Inc.</em>.  
<em>The Daily Show</em> when it's not on strike.  We
love TV but I think we're going to cancel cable; it's just
too expensive for the few shows we watch, and for all the
millions of channels there is almost nothing to watch
on an spontaneous basis; if we don't have anything saved
on the PVR we're pretty much screwed.  So we're going to
switch to downloading or (more likely) reading books.
</p>
<p>
Life is pretty full and busy and there's not much time to
breathe, and that's with me home all the time.  I don't know
how people with jobs do it (apart from if I had a job
I would damn well pay someone to do all the housework).  
My days are pretty much preordained starting at around
11:30 am until 7:00 pm, and this is the first time that
being a Mum has really felt like a job in the usual sense.
Previously I've had all kinds of things to do and lots of
demands on my attention, but I've been able to more-or-less
define when I did stuff and what I did (apart from the obviously
non-negotiable diaper changes and naps and stuff), but now 
I need to be up and out and getting things done whether 
I feel like it or not.  
</p>
<p>
Not that
I am complaining; the structure certainly doesn't hurt and it
certainly passes the time and keeps me honest.  My chief complaint 
right now is
with the weather; I hate wresting little Cordelia into 
snowpants and boots because it takes forever and it's hard on my
back.  I can't wait until she's old enough to
do that stuff herself, which should be next winter.  (Never
mind that, there are still mothers who try and help their
kindergartners with snow pants!)  In general we are all pretty
happy with our lots in life; Delphine loves school, Cordelia
loves school, they mostly love each other, Blake likes his
job and I like mine, we love each other and we're mad about
the girls.  Can't ask for much more that!

                    <p>At the Royal Winter Fair this year, Amy picked up a small bag of
malted barley flour, because she likes the taste of malt, and because
we have a recipe for malt bread which calls for malted (not barley)
flour.  We’ve since tried to use it in a few different loaves, and
while I quite enjoy the taste, as little as a quarter of a cup will
make the bread twice as dense as usual, and incredibly sticky to
boot.</p>

<p>It seems like it would be a useful thing to have, so that if you
had a bread that you knew was going to be a little dry for some
reason, you could just add a pinch of the stuff, and moisten it right
up, but I still haven’t figured out how little to put in to get a
slightly-moister bread which doesn’t adhere to the knife.  If I do,
I’ll be sure to post a comment, but until then, if you manage to get
some malted barley flour, be exceedingly sparing in your use of it,
and I’ll continue experimenting and picking bread out of my teeth.</p>

Today marks exactly one year since we moved into our little
house.  A year ago this evening we were sitting amid piles and
piles of boxes, still fretting from our run-in with surly
movers and our inability to locate toothbrushes or pyjamas
for the children.  Last Christmas was a cluttered mess with no
decorations except for a tiny pre-decorated tree.  
The months ahead would be full of frozen 
convenience food because our stove was unusable (although very
funky!), dim lighting, long walks to daycare, and the crustiest 
old linoleum I had
ever seen.  When I look back at it now I wonder how we 
possibly got through it, but at the time it seemed all right.
Kind of.
</p>
<p>
So after slogging through a long and unChristmassy December
in the new house, we interviewed a few contractors.  Mostly
they didn't seem to want to have anything to do with us, probably
because I got a list of recommendations from a friend of
contractors from the suburbs, and I bet they don't care to
bother with little houses with no driveway and tiny doors
and muddy access lanes when they can find a million suburban
clients with huge houses and lots of land to park their
dumpsters on.  But we finally found a guy who was really
nice and seemed helpful and smart, and seemed to understand
what we wanted, and who cost a billion
dollars.  We were very sad.  We looked at our reno plan
and started making cuts, and got into big fights; Blake
wanted to take down the walls and make do with the kitchen,
I thought I couldn't possibly make do with the kitchen and
the walls were aesthetic and could wait.  We cried.  Well,
I cried.  It sucked.
</p>
<p>
Then finally Andy made us meet with Stephanie and her
company, and they agreed to do the whole job for about half
the price the other dude was asking.  Half the price.  We had to make sure
they hadn't made a mistake about what we wanted, their price
was so low.  Well, the fact was they were doing a 
huge favour for Andy because he's such a swell guy; they
made us promise never to tell anyone else what they
charged us because they would go out of business if they
did any other jobs at that rate.  (It's good to have a
really charming father-in-law!)  So we didn't have to compromise.
We got it all: we took down the walls on the main floor,
we got a whole new kitchen, we tiled the front hall, 
we redid the electrical in the whole house and painted.
It all took only a couple of months, and to Stephanie
and her team's credit, they did everything to the 
exact same high standard that they set for their richer
clients, because they take personal pride in doing their
jobs properly.  
</p>
<p>
In fact, just last week I discovered that
the trained monkeys who installed our Ikea  kitchen had
neglected to install the forced air vent.  They didn't just
forget, they actually saw that it should be done, didn't do
it, and willfully assembled the cabinetry so that the venting was 
very hard to install, because that was the easy thing for
them to do.  Cory had left a piece of venting there to 
show them where they would need to work around, and they 
took it out and tossed it aside, and then installed a
cabinet with the legs directly in front of the vent hole in 
the wall.  So last week when I realized there was no heat
in the kitchen, I emailed Stephanie.  She sent Cory in,
Cory arrived with his tools, assessed the situation, 
figured out a solution, implemented the solution, tidied
up and was out of there in a couple of hours.  No bill,
no invoice, nothing; it was considered part of the 
original reno, which is already paid for.  
</p>
<p>
Stephanie has also sent members of her team back to repair
and paint cracks in the walls where the new drywall 
settled, to fix a sticky latch on a gate, and to clean
up some foam caulking stuff which someone had spilled
on the floor.  Stephanie believes in leaving a perfect
site, no matter how long it takes.
</p>
<p>
The reno wasn't a lot of fun to live through.  We set up
a makeshift kitchen (microwave, toaster oven and fridge)
next to the laundry sink in the basement and spent our days
there, in the tiny corner of the living room which was
cordoned off with a plastic sheet, and at Baba and Zaida's
house.  Oh, that sucked and it was a very long eight weeks
but it passed as inexorably as any other eight weeks, and 
one day it was over; appliances installed, plaster dust
vacuumed up, paint dried.  Suddenly we were normal people
with a normal (mostly) house.  What bliss!  What joy!
</p>
<p>
Now we have a house with lots of space on the main
floor (well... relatively speaking), a bright, sunny,
organized kitchen which gets a lot of use, tons of 
electrical outlets and lights, and a huge back deck.  I'm
really starting to like this house.  I did suffer a pang
of jealousy sitting in my friend's south-facing living
room.  We don't have any south-facing windows, and the
west windows are in the kitchen and Delphine's room, and
they're really pretty small.  So we don't get that ocean
of warm sunshine we used to get in the condo, and I miss
that on sunny winter days.  I hope that a couple of skylights
will make the house brighter.  One day.
</p>
<p>
A year ago today, cold, frustrated, tired, missing the condo
and wondering what the hell we had done, I consoled myself 
with the thought that in 
a year everything would be normal and happy again, and I was
right.  Yesterday we spent the whole day putting up our
(really rather huge, in this place) Christmas tree, spangling
the mantelpiece with tinsel and lights and tiny china Santas
(and a menorah, poor thing), and stringing J'Anne's beautiful
handmade stockings all up the staircase.  The house is warm
and cozy and full of love and giggling little girls, and I
could hardly be any happier.

                    <p>So I hit the Apple Store in the Eaton Center again today, to play
with the iPod Touch a little more, and now I’m kind of sad that I did.
There seem to be a few things about it that I don’t know if I can deal
with.  First, the screen apparently uses a <a href="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/ipod-touch2.htm">capacitive
screen</a>, which basically means that you need to use your fingers to
touch it.  No slightly-longer-than-normal thumbnails, no left-over spare
stylii, nothing that could make the large surface area of my stubby
fingers slightly smaller.  This turned out to be a little annoying when
I was trying to type.  I would probably get used to it if it weren’t for
the second problem.  Very few of the apps seem to support landscape-mode
text input.  Where by "very few", I mean "only Safari".  The keyboard in
portrait-mode is just a little too small for my fingers.  Bah, who am I
kidding?  The keyboard in landscape-mode is just a little too small for
my fingers.  The keyboard in portrait-mode is way too small for my
fingers.</p>

<p>So, I can’t really type on it.  That’s a fairly big problem.  But at
least I can download videos and music from my website, so that when I’m
at the office, and I see that my long DVD-to-iPod conversion has
finished, I can grab a copy of it over HTTP to watch on the commute
home…  But when I tried it, it was a total no-go.  None of the avis
worked, which isn’t totally surprising, but the mp3s in the same
directory also gave me the “Safari is unable to download this file”.
WTF?!?  An MP3 player that can’t play MP3s?  The biggest downside of
this whole trip is that I can’t really think of a good way around either
of those problems.  I mean, I guess text editors will come out which
allow landscape-mode keyboards, but it’s going to be annoying every time
I go to enter a new appointment, or contact.  And I don’t have any idea
what I could do to get around the no-downloading stuff. So I guess I’m
back to looking at other options (and maybe ending up asking Jeremy for
my SD Card back).  And no, I don’t think the Nintendo DS is a reasonable
replacement.  It’s too… game-y.  Not enough like an actual PDA.</p>
