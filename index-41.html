I am sorry I was rude to you.  I know you are up in the middle of
the night somewhere in India trying to convince irate Canadians
to switch to your idiotic home phone service, and you are just
doing your job and following a script, but honestly.  Do you have
to call twice a week?  In the middle of naptime?  Please just stop.

    <p>The main tip-off that these are back-dated entries is my inability
not to use 21:12 as the posting time.</p>

<p>The left-hand image is of a flower beside a river.  The blue at the
top of the picture is the sky.  Only having one shade of blue is one
of the limitations you have to work around when using a free drawing
app on an MP3 player.  Less of a limitation when you’re 4.  The
drawing on the right is a flower, and the sun.  Or maybe it’s a
sunflower.  Heh.</p>

before she goes to sleep.  I recently found out that I could email the

    <p>Today, at 3:20, Amy and I took Mimi to the vet, and had her put
down.</p>
<p>It’s really hard, and I’m finding that I have to kind of pull back
from it for a while, or I’ld be totally bawling all the time I’m
writing this.</p>
<p>She was cranky, rude, ill-tempered, and maybe a little mean
(although never to me).  But I did love her, and she really seemed to
be getting worse, and not enjoying life anymore, and so I think that
it is the right decision, hard though it is.  Heck, just looking at
her, sleeping on the sofa beside me last night, I could totally see
that she wasn’t right.  She was in pain, and wasn’t happy anymore, and
didn’t have much of a prospect of getting better.  (Certainly not
while we weren’t willing to spend $1000’s of dollars treating cancer.
Chemotherapy seems like a cruel thing to put a cat through.)  She’s
also the first pet I’ve ever had to put down.  I was sad when the rats
died, but this feels totally different, probably because we’re doing
it by choice, instead of it happening on its own time.  I guess I just
figured that she would disappear one night, and I could delude myself
into thinking that she found another home, but it’s probably better
this way.  More of a sense of closure, and all that...</p>
<p>She went really quickly, (really really quickly,) which was a
blessing, and the vet agreed that she was on her way out, and that we
probably did the right thing at the right time.</p>
<p>I can also see why people believe in God and Heaven and stuff.  I
would kind of like to believe that Mimi has gone to some sort of
better place, but I know in my heart that she hasn’t.  That she’s just
gone.  And it sucks.</p>

<p>On a happier note, there are a lot of things I want to remember
about her, both good and bad.  The way her head smelled of ginger and
cinnamon.  The time she made Kathryn cry while she was babysitting for
us.  How loud and incessant her purr was.  The way she would always
hiss and swipe at Colin when we were all working in my living room.
How soft she was under her chin.  The way she let Amy (and only Amy)
comfort her after spending a night at the vet.  Heck, I even want to
remember the way she would scratch her ass on the rug, and complain
when I wanted to sit down on my couch.  Damn stupid cat.  I loved
her.</p>

    <p>Yeah, like I was done messing with my iTouch.  Whatever.</p>

<p>I've been playing around a lot with the iTouch, and developing
quite a few programs for it.  The first one was by request, although
I’m also finding it very useful.  (And apparently a <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?p=4754458">few other
people</a> are as well!  Cool!)  It’s called <a href="http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/~chris/iphone/WifiToggle/">WifiToggle</a>, and it’s a small app that simply toggles on and off
your Wifi connection, so as to save batteries.  The next thing I did
was <a href="http://iphone.latte.ca/info/Javascript.html">a port</a>
of the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/">SpiderMonkey
Javascript</a> interpreter.  It works, and it wasn’t that hard to get
compiled and installed, which is really pretty cool when you stop to
think about it.</p>

<p>The final thing I got working just tonight (which I was playing
around with mostly to take my mind off of stuff.  See tomorrow’s post
for details), was <a href="http://iphone.latte.ca/info/GambitScheme.html">a port</a> of the
<a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Gambit Scheme</a> interpreter.  I know, Scheme is just like
Javascript, only with an uglier syntax, but I still like it, and
hopefully the lack of punctuation will make it easier to use on the
iTouch.  Heh.</p>

<p>Anyways, if you own an iPhone or iTouch, and have jailbroken it, be
sure to add <a href="http://iphone.latte.ca/">http://iphone.latte.ca/</a> to your list of Installer sources, and
geek out!</p>

I was pondering, a few weeks ago, how great my relationship with
Blake is, how he respects me and treats me as equal in every way,
and I wondered when and how I developed an intolerance for men
who behave any differently.  I cannot and do not abide any kind of
sexist comments or behaviour, and I think that's partially why
I have such a good relationship with Blake; because I would not
give him the time of day if he weren't the kind of man who treats
women as equal.
</p>
<p>
But where does my insistance on respect come from, I wondered?
Definitely not from my parents' relationship, which is really just
kind of weird.  Then I realized it was from my relationship with
my brother.  When we were growing up Dave and I were best friends;
in each others' pockets, confidantes and pals, and Dave never ever
suggested I was less capable, less intelligent, less anything because
I was a girl.  I don't think it even occurred to him; he always had
female friends and he's one of those men who simply treats women
as human beings.  That set the bar pretty high for every other man
on the planet, and so while I don't have many male friends, the ones I
do have are golden, because they have to pass the "Dave Brown
Don't Treat Me Like A Idiot" test.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
I was listening to my iPod Shuffle and it gave me "So Far Away From Me"
by Dire Straits and it took me back to one of the happiest memories
of my adolescence. I used to spend countless hours and countless 
evenings in my brother's room just hanging out;  I played
games on his computer, and I guess we must have talked, although
I don't remember about what.  I remember it as dark in his room, and
warm, and full of that teenage boy funky smell which to this day
I still rather like.  We used to listen to Dire Straits and Elton
John and The Eagles and Don Henley and Travelling Wilburys
and all that old man music that
Dave favoured at the time and has probably grown out of by now.
(I haven't!  Love me some old man music.)  I don't remember
how often I was in Dave's room or for how long, but looking back it seems
like I was there all the time, just enjoying his company.  How 
many teenage brothers and sisters can say they had a relationship 
like that?
</p>
<p>
So there are two things about my brother (known about these
parts as Uncle Dave).  It was his thirty-fourth birthday yesterday.
Happy Birthday Dave!
