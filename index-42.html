<p>And you’re done.</p>
<p>I guess you might be wondering why I would bother doing that, since
both Amy and I are obviously comfortable writing straight HTML.  Well,
<a href="http://www.drproject.org/">DrProject</a> is switching from a
custom-built Wiki-ish-syntax parser to a <a href="http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/">third-party</a> Markdown parser,
and I figured this would give me a bit of a headstart on getting used
to the new syntax, and also give me a bit of a playground for testing
out new features that I might want to add.</p>

This Tuesday we were treated to a most peculiar sight; our street,
which usually has between six and ten cars parked on it, was empty
of cars but full of two Bobcats and a huge yellow snow eating/spitting
machine, and a steady succession of dump trucks being filled with snow.  We
have had so much snow this winter (a storm every three days in
February alone) that the city has given up trying to shovel it around and
is <em>trucking it away</em> to who knows where?  And in order to
get the job done they have resorted to the extreme measure of 
towing people's cars around the corner, moving the snow, then
towing the cars back (I think, or maybe they just leave the cars
where they dropped them!).  It's costing millions and it's a little
crazy, but I'm glad they did it because it was getting almost
impossible to get over the huge snowbanks at every intersection,
even with the awesome stroller.
</p>
<p>
As far as I am concerned, spring cannot come too soon this year.
Although I suspect we're in for a spell more winter yet.

    <p>
Today has been nice, so far.  I managed to jettison my children —
Cordelia to nursery school and Delphine to a friend's house — and
then I went to Doug Miller Books and talked with Doug Miller himself
about the sad state of kids' books, then up to Bean
Sprout and chatted for a bit with the girl there about our sad little
house and our big reno and our big debt.  Then I emerged into the
sunshine and realized, not for the first time, that the thing which
makes this stay-at-home mom thing so hard for me is how lonely
it is.  I am not one of those solitary people, one of those people
who needs time alone to recharge; I need people.  I would be happy
if I had friends at my house <em>all the time</em>.  
</p>
<p>If you ask my friend
Jeff from work he will tell you I spent half my time at the office 
hanging out with him talking about movies and TV shows and life. 
What he doesn't know is that I spent the other half online chatting
with my brother and on my favourite message board.
(Yeah, I didn't get much work done, although no-one seemed to mind.)
One of my favourite times of my life was when I was in university,
when there was always someone around to hang out with
no matter what time of day,
even if it was only some creepy Unix guy with a dirty beard.
</p>
<p>
But here I am, here I have been for almost five years, with very
little company.  Sometimes a friend comes over, and that's great,
but mostly it's just me and the little ones, and they keep me busy
and they're fun to be around (except when they're not) but they're
no substitute for grown-up company.  And I realized today I think 
that's one of the reasons I'm such a sucker for these ensemble
dramas, like <em>Firefly</em> and <em>Torchwood</em>; because
I miss that cameraderie and rapport and just plain companionship.
</p>
<p>
So today was good, pathetically enough, because the sun was
shining in that way that makes you think maybe, one day, spring
will come, and because I had a little time to myself, unhurried,
to get some jobs done, and because I got to hang out with Doug
Miller and the Bean Sprout girl whose name I don't even know and
have some company and talk about things I care about with people
who know how I feel.  And I feel a little bit nourished, a little
bit more filled up, a little bit less lonely.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
Lest you think I'm one of those horrible mothers who is only happy
when she gets away from her children, let me tell you about Family
Day.  Family Day is the contrived excuse for a February long weekend
that the Ontario government has decreed.  I am all for a long weekend
in winter — I have been saying we need one for years — but I think
if you are the kind of person who spends long weekends with your
family you will anyway, and if you aren't nothing Dalton McGuinty says
is going to make you want to.  
</p>
<p>
But we like to spend our free time together, so this first Family Day,
after the girls and I had
breakfast we gathered all the saved-up paper towel rolls and cereal 
boxes and
popsicle sticks and packing tape together and built a crazy castle
with turrets and towers all akimbo, and then Delphine and Cordelia
strapped on their smocks and I got out the poster paint and they 
decorated the thing, which is now on display on our desk in the living
room.  I figure we can keep decorating it for years, probably.
</p>
<p>
That was all done and cleaned-up-after by ten thirty, so I kicked the
family into action to help me vacuum (they pick up all the toys and
small furniture off the floor and I vacuum).  Delphine went off to a friend's
house for lunch, and while Cordelia was napping I read pages and pages
of my book — chapters and chapters! — while Blake did I don't know
what.  Something on the computer, I think.
</p>
<p>
After Delphine came home and Cordelia woke up we all made calzone together,
then the girls went to bed and Blake and I watched TV (guess what we watched?) 
and it was pretty much my perfect day.  Playing and reading and cooking and
a freshly vacuumed house?  Heaven.

Pronounced "windjing", it means "complaining persistently and in a 
peevish or irritating way".  Since so much of my blogging (and indeed
most people's) is devoted to general or specific pissing and moaning,
I thought I'd better give it its own category.  Not so much to elevate
the whiny posts, but to segregate them from the rest of the weblog,
the parts which might give you the impression that I'm a normal
well-adjusted person and not a neurotic whining freak.
</p>
<p>
I had a teeny tiny breakdown this morning.  It started yesterday;
I was reading a book and one of the characters was talking about
lying awake all night with insomnia.  Luckily I have never had
trouble sleeping, because the very thought of trying to deal with
the children and get through a day without any sleep (or even without
the seven hours which I absolutely need) got me into a bit of a
panic.  Then I got to thinking about how one person raising a
family, alone for most of the day, is completely abnormal from a
biological point of view.  Humans are pack animals, we are supposed
to live in extended family groups.  I should have grannies and
aunties and big sisters and cousins around to help me with my
kids while I help with theirs.  I shouldn't have to pull Cordelia
out of her nap every single day to pick Delphine up from school,
or drag Delphine away from her activities so we can get Cordelia
from her school.
</p>
<p>
So there was all that, and on top of it the children are fighting
like ferrets in a sack all the time, or at least it seems like it,
and furthermore Delphine has started to explore the exciting world
of misbehaviour and deception — and I'm feeling singularly unqualified
to deal with that — and I have a cough and a sinus infection
and it's bloody cold outside — I am so sick of winter — and I'm tired 
and all I want to do is 
sit on the couch eating brownies and watching Jack Harkness kiss 
people, which isn't going
to happen until I have dragged my carcass through another sorry day
of this madness.  The nice thing about working in an office is that
you can phone it in for a day, or a week, or even a month or two and
no-one seems to notice, but as a Mom you have to step up and cook and
clean and pick up and drop off every single bloody blessed day with
no reprieve.  Well, except after bedtime.  Thank god for bedtime.
And thank god my kids are as good as they are, because as Blake's
mother says, "You think this is bad, you should see regular children!"
</p>
<p>
And that has been the whinge for today.  Thank you very much.

Three TV shows worth watching: 
<a href="http://www.nbc.com/Chuck/">Chuck</a>, which looks like
absolute cheesy crap but it has great characters, and it's funny,
and hey, it has 
<a href="http://www.nbc.com/Chuck/about/bios/baldwin.shtml">Jayne</a>!
<a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">Battlestar Galactica</a>,
which pretty much everyone knows about now.  Fantastic characters 
(that's mainly what I look for in a TV show) and thought-provoking
plot lines.  And last but not least, my current favourite,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchwood">Torchwood</a>,
the show that makes me wish Leontine still worked for the BBC so
she could design a cool box for the DVD and then send it to me. 
With the DVDs in it.
Russell T. Davies is a brilliant writer who has created an ensemble
of witty, subtle and interesting (oh, and gorgeous) characters and 
put them in a universe
which keeps throwing horrible things at them.  If you miss 
<em>Buffy</em>, this is the show for you.
</p>
<p>
Edited to add: (I mentioned this to Blake yesterday and he said I
should post it.  I guess any vestigial signs of intelligence should
be encouraged.)  <em>Torchwood</em> is the show <em>Angel</em> would 
have been if it
had been better written and David Boreanaz was a better actor: it's
dark, sexy, adult, scary, with lots of great one-liners and sex.  Plenty
of sex.
</p>
<p>
Jeez.  Apparently I am not the first person to make that connection;
<a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/tv/2008/01/time_to_relight_torchwood.html">Russell
T. Davies was</a>.  Well, he did borrow Spike, didn't he.

Delphine is a few months shy of turning five, and she has become
a tremendously capable and independent little thing,  to the point
that I am having trouble figuring out where to set limits.
</p>
<p>
I recently read a wonderful book called <em>Breaking the Good Mom
Myth</em> by Alyson Schafer.  Schafer is an Adlerian psychotherapist,
and the <a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/HStein/guid.htm">Adlerian
philosphy</a> basically says, among other things, that you should throw
as much responsibility on your child as they can handle.  This is
something Blake and I have been doing all along, but the book features
an inspiring list of things that kids should be able to do at each age.
By the time she's eight she'll be running the whole household!
</p>
<p>
Delphine's been dressing herself since she was two, and she can easily
handle the putting on of winter gear that some kids older than her
are still getting helped with.  (I was going to say they couldn't
manage it, but I am sure they could if their parents would just leave
them to it.)  But lately the independence has been getting out of hand.
The other morning I came downstairs to see that Delphine had used a
steak knife to slice a chunk, for breakfast, off an old moldy loaf 
I had forgotten
about.  Yesterday she used my facecloths to clean up after her friend
peed on the bedroom floor.  It's like there's no challenge she can't
face alone!
</p>
<p>
Which is great, but we are going to have to draw some lines and make
some rules.  The first rule has to be about knives, specifically don't
touch them.  The second has to be something about cleaning up messes,
I think.  Cleaning up messes is just very complicated, what with the
different products and tools, not to mention the biohazard factor.  A
grown-up has to be involved.  I am sure we will figure out the limits
we need to set, but in the meantime it's pretty exciting to see her
growing up.

Due to various factors, it has come to pass that Cordelia has been 
the subject of a parent-teacher interview several months
before her older sister will be.  I was supposed to meet with 
Cordelia's nursery school teachers back in December, but I barely
had time to breathe let alone sit around talking about my kids
(usually my favourite pastime).  So I finally managed to meet
with Lakeisha and Simone a couple of weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
My original thought was, this is going to be kind of pointless;
Cordelia's two, she plays in water and makes pictures and builds
towers out of blocks.  How much is there going to be to say?  But
as it turns out I am really glad I went because hearing about
how she behaves in school has given me a whole perspective on
Cordelia.
</p>
<p>
Apparently Cordelia is very focussed in class; she will work on
something for ten or fifteen minutes.  If you know anything about
two-year-olds you know how weird that is; usually they do stuff
for a couple of minutes then move on to the next thing.  The "Your
X-Year-Old" series of books has a little overhead diagram of a
room with various activities set up, and then a map of a typical
kid's path through that room, and the map for the two-year-old is
like a bowl of spaghetti.  Not Cordelia.  I saw an example of that
focus in action the other day at supper as she painstakingly shelled
three snow pea pods.  (Ever since we gave them edamame my kids have had
trouble knowing what peas need to be shelled.)  She apparently also
comes back to things; the teachers know to leave her pictures or
whatever out because she'll come back later to work on them.
</p>
<p>
She has only been talking at school since after Christmas; she's been
talking for us for ages, but she held back at school and now they're
astounded at her voice.  Well, mostly the other children.  "She talks!"
But what Lakeisha and Simone actually said — and if you know Cordelia
in person you should make sure you're sitting down right now — is,
"They're surprised when she talks because she's usually so quiet."
Quiet!  Apparently the Cordelia at school is the quiet, studious 
Cordelia.
</p>
<p>
She's also observant; she was the first and only kid to notice a new
science table the day I went to visit, and she examined everything on
it with her (apparently) usual thoroughness.
</p>
<p>
I am really pleased I went to the meeting and was able to hear about
this other side of Cordelia.  I think the problem with having exactly
two kids is that you end up forcing them into false dichotomies:
Delphine is the quiet one, therefore Cordelia must be the loud one;
Delphine is the studious one, therefore Cordelia must be the flippertigibbet.
This was an excellent reminder that it is profoundly important to
step back and see my children for who they really are, not just
who they aren't because that's who their sister is.  Otherwise I risk
missing the most wonderful and interesting parts of them.
</p>
<p>
This has also made me really glad that I put Cordelia in nursery
school, despite the gruelling mess it makes of my day twice a week.
(I'm the mother, what the hell else am I doing anyway?)  It's such
a great opportunity for her to blossom outside of the home and away
from her sister and me.
</p>
<p>
And finally, I am very excited about Delphine's parent-teacher interview.
What surprises has my oldest been hiding?  What will I learn about her?
I can't wait.

<p>I was reading <a href="http://blogs.mathworks.com/images/steve/92/handout_final_icip2006.pdf">a presentation</a> about how to write better software for non-developers, and it said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would refuse to work on any sort of collaborative software
development project that doesn’t use version control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I totally agree.  Heck, I even use version control for my personal
one-off projects.  But it got me wondering what people use at their
jobs, so I asked my friends who were on instant messenger, as a straw
poll.  The results were shockingly unanimous.  <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>.  8 for 8.  I regret to say that I’m
not using Subversion at my job, but that may change someday.  In the
meantime, leave a comment, and tell me what you’re using at work or at
home, either to make me feel better, or to rub my nose in it.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: One person uses Clear Case.  I’ve heard good things about
Clear Case.</p>

For some reason I am feeling a bit melancholy this afternoon,
so I thought I would buck up and listen to some music and do
some housework.
</p>
<p>
First my iPod gave me "Why Worry" by Dire Straits, which is
kind of a bummer song anyway, and which reminds me of my brother
Dave (see above) who I miss these days.  Then came on "Song
for a Winter's Night" by Sarah McLachlan, which for some reason
always makes me really lonely for my mother, and I thought what
the hell, no-one's around, why not shed a few tears.  Then
that song ended and I thought good, that's enough gloom!  
What's next?
</p>
<p>
"Close Your Eyes", the Buffy and Angel theme from <em>Buffy
The Vampire Slayer</em>.  Kill me now.  With a big sword.
Even though you really love me.  It's for the good of the world.
