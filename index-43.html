Wow, I didn't realize I hadn't updated my book log since 
August.  That's insane!  Book log updates take a long
time, so I guess I put off doing them, but eight months?
Here are the books I read from August to the end
of last year, and I'll post this year's books in another
post.  One day.  Maybe in August.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Three Junes</em> by Julia Glass</strong> was a
vacation read I borrowed from Baba, and it was a great book.
I am looking at all the notes I made on it after I read it,
and sadly despite having written the notes and now reading
them, I don't remember much of the story, which doesn't reflect 
well on my attempts to read more attentively and remember
what I read.  Anyway, it's one of those novels with dozens
of different characters whose lives intersect in interesting
ways.  The characters are beautifully drawn and the intersections
of their lives are plausible and enjoyable to read about.
</p>
<p>
I sound like an idiot when I try and write about fiction!  Maybe
non-fiction too.  Oh, I wish I were smarter.  You would think
all this reading would help.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Get Smart: Nine Sure Ways to Help Your Child Succeed 
in School</em> by Ronald Dietel</strong>.  I think I picked this
up because it was on display at the library.  That is to say, I
didn't order it especially, and I'm not worried about Delphine's
academic development or anything.  I'm not even particularly 
worried about whether she "succeeds" in school; the question of
whether getting good grades can be considered succeeding is very
much up in the air for me at the moment.  Anyway, that's now,
but back in September when I read this book I thought it would be
cool to know how to help my kid succeed in school.
</p>
<p>
Dietel starts by commenting on the fact that apparently there is
no time to be a kid any more, and there's big pressure on even the
smallest of children to succeed in school.  "The words 'let them be
kids' are becoming a faint echo of the past."  And that's all he
says.  He doesn't say that sucks, he doesn't say you should be a
counterpoint to the pressure in your kid's life, he doesn't say 
maybe achieving in school isn't the be all and end all.  And I guess
he wouldn't!  If he felt that way I bet he would have written a 
different book.
</p>
<p>
He goes on the talk about the different factors which affect your
kid's success at school (specifically: ability, effort, attitute, 
school quality,
teacher quality, school learning habits, home learning habits, evaluations,
communication).  And then for each factor he talks about how you can 
affect and improve it, varying from study techniques to working with
your kid's teacher to homework routines.  It was a pretty useful book,
for what it was.  I am older and wiser* now than I was when I read the 
book, and have some different
perspectives on school and learning and how much involvement I
should have in my kid's life, so even though I only read this book
a few months ago I think I would approach it a lot differently 
if I read it today.
</p>
<p>
* I am older and wiser now mainly because of a book I just read
called <em>Punished by Rewards</em> by Alfie Kohn which has blown
my mind and made me rethink everything about interacting with my
children, but in the best possible way.  I will post about it 
sometime.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Not-So-Star-Spangled Life of Sunita Sen</em> by Mitali 
Perkins</strong>; another just-picked-it-up choice.  This is a 
young adult novel about an Indian-American teenager who is 
torn between her traditional grandparents and her desire to
be an ordinary American girl.  I generally liked the story
and the message of the book, but I am spoiled by all the
Canadian books I usually read and was really put off by all
the American references.  I don't see why an American book 
shouldn't have American references, but there's something nice
about books set in Canada.  They're easier to read.  I expect
the same is true about books set in Sweden if you're Swedish.
I also though that Sunita's boyfriend's exoticization of Indian
culture was kind of creepy, but it was presented positively in the book. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance</em> by 
Atul Gawande</strong> is a book about how to succeed in medicine,
or any endeavour which involves risk and responsibility.  Gawande's
three core requirements for success are Diligence, Doing Right
and Ingenuity.  He illustrates them with fascinating examples
from the field, from the difficulty in getting people (doctors!)
to wash their hands to the subtleties of conduct in the examining
room, to the near-magical improvements in neonatal survival
after the introduction of the Apgar score.  This is a wonderfully
written, interesting and thought-provoking book, whether you
are a doctor or just want to be smarter and better at what you
do every day.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, here are Gawande's five "Suggestions for Becoming
A Positive Deviant":
</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask an unscripted question; be interested in someone else,
surprise them, learn something about the people you see every day,
find their humanity.</li>
<li>Don't complain; it drags you and everyone else down, it is
unhelpful and boring.</li>
<li>Count something, track something; be a scientist in the world.
If you count something you find interesting, you will learn something
interesting.</li>
<li>Write something; add some small observations about your world;
step back and think about a problem; make yourself a part of the
larger conversation.</li>
<li>Change; respond to new ideas; recognize the inadequacies in what
you do and seek out solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Find something new to try, count how often you succeed, write about
it, ask people what they think.  See if you can keep the conversation
going.  These are words I try to live by, even in my relatively small
world.  I strive for constant improvement.  That sounds really dorky,
but it's true.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>How Doctors Think</em> by Jerome Groopman</strong>.  Another
fantastic book!  It's great when I get two good books in a row.  This
is a fascinating book about, as it says, how doctors think, and mainly
how they diagnose.  Groopman talks about the inadequacies in medical
training, how doctors feel about you as a patient, how they come to
their conclusions and how they can get stuck in stereotyped views of
you and your condition.  Most importantly he writes about how you can
ask questions to understand your doctor's thinking and perhaps gently
steer them in a different direction if you feel like they are not giving
enough thought to your condition, or if you just want to understand
their diagnosis better.
</p>
<p>
Everyone who is a patient should read this book, and doctors should
too.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Simple Home: The Luxury of Enough</em> by Sarah 
Nettleton</strong>.  This is mainly house porn; lots of pretty pictures
of "simple" houses; houses that are exactly as big and complex as they 
need to 
be, and no more.  Pretty and inspirational.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Supernanny: How To Get The Best From Your Children</em> by 
Jo Frost</strong>  and <strong><em>Nanny Wisdom: Our Secrets for Raising 
Healthy, Happy 
Children — From Newborns to Preschoolers</em> by Justine Walsh 
and Kim Nicholson</strong>.  I read these books because I was looking
for inspiration on how to discipline Cordelia, who was just getting
into a bit of a hellish phase.  Both books favoured timeouts, which I
tried and which failed miserably because Cordelia would either be
completely happy on the "naughty step", or Delphine would go over and
comfort her.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, otherwise these are pretty good books which emphasise what I
consider to be the cornerstone of good parenting, a structured routine.
They also both give a shoutout to an early bedtime, another parenting
tool which I think is sadly underused these days.
</p>
<p>
However, I wish the <em>Nanny Wisdom</em> nannies would stick 
to general parenting advice 
and stay away from advice on nursing, which is... well, it's none of
their business and they don't know what they're talking about.  They
say you should stop nursing at a year and they say that at some point
your milk dries up and your kid is just nursing for pleasure.  Which
is not true at all!  They clearly overstepped the bounds of their
own expertise there.  If you want good nursing advice, the book for
you is <em>Breastfeeding Made Simple</em> by Nancy Mohrbacher and Kathleen 
Kendall-Tackett.  Not some nanny book.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Finding Flow: The Psychology of Engagement with Everyday 
Life</em> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</strong>.  Flow is what you
experience when you are completely involved in what you are doing, 
when you feel simultaneously focused and transcendent.  It doesn't
happen very often, and Csikszentmihalyi has studied when it happens
and how.  This is a book about how to fully engage in life, how
to live without waste of time or potential.  If you don't believe
in an afterlife then you know we've only got maybe eighty years
of consciousness, and you'd better believe I don't want to waste
any of mine.  This is a wonderful book about finding happiness
and fulfillment, sometimes where you least expect it (like at work!).
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Factory Girl</em> by Barbara Greenwood</strong>.  
Barbara Greenwood is a lady in my choir who writes really neat
history books for children, which combine historical facts with
a narrative.  She tells the story for a few pages and then breaks
off and talks about the facts behind the story.  This was an
interesting read for me because it made me realize how much I
bluff when I'm reading historical fiction. For example, the character
in the book works in a sweatshop that makes shirtwaists.  Sure,
shirtwaists, I thought!  Cool!  It was only three pages later when
Greenwood breaks out and says, in effect, "Here is what a shirtwaist
is" along with a few illustrations out of the Eaton's catalogue, that
I realize I had no idea what it was, really.  Similarly she tells
what, specifically, you could buy with the girl's meagre pay.  I
found this to be a very effective teaching technique; I
think you're more likely to ask questions about what you're reading
if you know that the answers are coming up, and I think these
books encourage curiosity.  I look
forward to reading more of Greenwood's books with the girls.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Bones to Ashes</em> by Kathy Reichs</strong>.  This was
better than the last Kathy Reichs.  I think I need another go-to 
mystery writer, though, because Reichs continues to annoy with her
sentence fragments and her "it's on the tip of my tongue" intuitive
mystery-solving.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Send: The Essential Guide to Email for Office and Home</em> by 
David Shipley and Will Schwalbe</strong>.  This was useful but I can't
remember exactly what I learned that I didn't already know.  Oh, I guess
I learned that it is considered okay to put the entire message in 
your subject header (if your message is short).  That always annoys me,
but I guess if no-one else minds I'll have to put up with it.  Also 
apparently you are only supposed to have one topic per email; if you
want to talk to someone about two things you should send two emails.
That sounds really maddening to me, but I have learned from experience
that some people just don't read (or comprehend) more than one
item or paragraph in an email message.  Also I suppose having one topic
per message might make it easier to file, if you're a dinosaur and you
still use folders instead of tags.
</p>
<p>
And that's the end of my 2007 reading!  I can't believe Cordelia is still
asleep!  I might even be able to post about what I've read in the last
three months sometime before the end of April.

    <p>A while ago, I had bought an iPod Touch, and started messing around
with the CSS on this weblog, to try and get it looking a little nicer
on the small screen.  Sadly, it never quite worked, and because of a
bug in my selector (“min-device-width” should have been
“max-device-width”), I broke the weblog for Safari too.  Fortunately,
today, I grabbed a copy of the latest version of Safari, and fixed the
bug!  So now iPhones and iTouches will both get a pretty version of
the site, and Safari 3.1 looks beautiful again.  Even more beautiful,
now that SVG is supported.  (<a href="blake/tech/doesThisWorkForYou">Give it a try</a>, and let me know if you can see the

Delphine is just under two months away from being five, and
in the last month or so she went through one of those quantum changes —
your kid goes to bed one day and she's four and a half, and
wakes up the next day and she's nearly five.  Her hair is
longer, her face is more girlish and less babyish, she has
all these freckles that came out of nowhere, she uses long
words and elaborate grammatical constructions, she can almost
read.  It's a bit dizzying, frankly, but I couldn't be happier.
The more she moves away from babyhood the more I like hanging
out with her.
</p>
<p>
So yeah, she can almost read.  I would say she's a few weeks
from really being able to read; she can sound out short
(phonically logical) words, and she is learning a few tricks
(like looking at the first letter and the associated picture
and guessing!) to work out the other 95% of the English
language.  She's also sight-learned a few words, which suits
me because that's largely how I (and I assume most literate
adults) read.
</p>
<p>
I will say now that I hate phonics.  I hated it when I was a
kid and I still hate it now.  I hated it when I was a kid because
it didn't work (and because I thought it was a lame crutch for
kids who couldn't "really" read — I was a huge snob when I was
a kid).  I hate it now because it still doesn't work; I feel like
such a fraud when I tell Delphine to "sound it out" when I know
that that's a technique which will hardly ever help her figure 
out a word.  I am 
perplexed by the
emphasis phonics receives, unless it's because no-one has come up
with a better way of "teaching" kids to read, and they want
to feel like they're doing something.  The English language is
too full of exceptions for phonics to be worth anything —
if you want to read anything more interesting than the most
pedestrian Easy Reader (another thing I hated as a kid) you
are going to come across the word "one" or the word "weigh"
or the word "said" and phonics is going to let you down.  I 
don't have any answers, though.  All I know is I figured out
how to read by being read to (no-one taught me) and I expect
my children will do that same, whether or not they 
learn "k-k-k-kite" at school.
</p>
<p>
Back to Delphine, who can also write.  She can form letters
like a demon, so she writes quickly if you spell things out for
her, but she's also really bold about writing on her own and
guessing how things are spelled.  She loves to write cards for
her friends.  "Athena I love you."  They are always love letters.
</p>
<p>
Okay, this is my last brag about Delphine, I promise.  We were
talking about aunties the other day; since she's been old enough
to talk we've been working with the convenient fiction that she
has two aunties, Auntie Morgan and Auntie J'Anne.  On Sunday I
decided she's old enough to understand that Auntie J'Anne is actually
Daddy's auntie and her Great-Aunt (although J'Anne is hardly the
quivering  old dear that the title implies).  To illustrate
the idea  I decided
to do a family tree.  I walked Delphine through drawing up a 
crude diagram with circles for each person and lines joining us all
up.  When it came to labelling, Delphine decided that she was going
to write each person's name around their circle, with the letters
projecting out perpendicular to the surface of the circle.  (I'll 
take a picture so you can see what I mean.)  And she did so, forming
each letter correctly with respect to the slope of the circle, without 
turning the paper around.  That means she can <em>rotate two-dimensional
objects in her head</em>!
</p>
<p>
Obviously I think that's pretty cool, whether or not almost-five is
exactly when you would expect someone to be able to rotate 
two-dimensional objects in their head (I have no idea).   It's
math!  Do you know what this means?  It means she'll be able to
read maps, and walk around strange cities without getting hopelessly
lost, and figure out where this bit goes on that bicycle without 
trying it!  It means she'll be able to do those useless spatial
manipulation questions in IQ tests!  I suppose I shouldn't be 
surprised that she has math
brain — she comes from two families of math heads — but I'm still
pleased.  Now we just need to get her doing cryptics.
</p>
<p>
Part of the being-almost-five (and not really four anymore) is that
Delphine is generally nicer to be around (don't let anyone tell you
about Terrible Twos, Four is much worse.  Twos get a bad rap.)  However
I can't get her to stop yelling at Cordelia.  Poor Cordelia seems
to get screamed at all day, when she won't give up a toy, when
she can't learn the rules of a game, when she hides wrong in 
Hide and Seek.  I know Delphine learned all about yelling from me,
but the scale is entirely different!  I have yelled at her fewer
than ten times in her whole life, whereas she seems to yell at
DeeDee ten times a day.  Well, maybe five.  I guess they mean
it when they say your bad behaviour will be reflected in your
kids' behaviour, but I didn't realize it would be magnified to 
this extent.  
I have a book out about managing Anger and Aggression (for parents
and children) so hopefully that will help.  Because I don't
have Clue One what to do at this point.  At least March Break is
over so they can get out of each other's hair for a while every
day.

    <p>It’s been a while since Delphine has wanted to play on my little
computer at bedtime.  We’ve been too busy reading old, old books about
animals of various kinds.  Yesterday, we both seemed to realize this,
and decided that tonight we would play on the little computer instead
of reading books.  I’m sure Delphine was thinking something more along
the lines of “We’ll play on the little computer, and <i>then</i> read
books”, but that was never going to happen.</p>

It's day three of March break, which I have been looking forward
to for a while.  As I might have mentioned a thousand times,
taking people to and from school is the thorn in my side for 
this winter, so a week of unstructured days where we don't have
to be anywhere in particular are any particular time sounds
awesome.  I'm also glad to say I haven't turned into one of
those Moms who is scared to face a week or even a day with
her kids.  (One of my favourite examples is an acquaintance
from school who has bought her kid millions of toys but "has"
to schedule her for activity after activity because she 
is "bored" at home.  My kids aren't allowed to be bored.)
</p>
<p>
So on Monday we had a friend of Delphine's over and they
did the usual dressing up and jumping on the bed and 
drawing pictures and stuff.  I threw together some 
lunch and then Delphine went over to the friend's house
while Cordelia napped and I ... I don't remember what
I did.  Read, maybe?
</p>
<p>
Tuesday we had a huge impromptu March Break Pizza Party.  
I had invited my friend Ellen over with her three, 
and my friend Tanya invited herself over (she's allowed
to do that) with her two, and she in turn mentioned
to a friend, Anna, that she was coming, and said friend
invited <em>her</em>self over (she's not really allowed
to do that but we have been muttering about getting
together sometime, and she's moving to England soon
so it's not like I need to worry about something awkward
developing.)  Anna has two boys, so altogether there
were nine children (two babies, three toddlers and
four kindergartners) and four Mummies.  We tossed 
the eldest out into the snow for a while where Jake
(the senior kindergartner) gave orders and pulled 
people around on the sled.  The Mums juggled babies
and made pizza and talked some awesome talk (I love
smart people) and then we hailed everyone in and fed
them all.  Then all the kids played upstairs.  It was
an interesting dynamic; they are all three and four and
I swear they spend eighty percent of the time discussing
what they were going to play and what the rules were
and whose rules they should use, and maybe twenty percent
of the time actually playing, usually chasing each other
and screaming.
</p>
<p>
Gradually people left (but not without cleaning the
kitchen first!) until it was just Tanya and me and ours,
and we agreed it was good fun but not something you'd want
to do every day.
</p>
<p>
Today I declared Toy Sort-Out day.  We brought every toy
in the house down to the dining room along with the assorted
boxes and bags and things they go in, and put everything
where it's supposed to be, creating new categories and 
boxes (with labels) as necessary.  I am trying to train 
them to be organized freaks like me.  It was hard work but
it only took the morning.  After lunch Delphine and I "rested"
on the couch (with the TV on) while DeeDee napped, and now 
they are outside painting the snow with food colouring-tinted
water, and making snow cookies with the sandbox toys I dug out.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow we're venturing downtown to the Gardiner Museum of
Ceramic Arts, and Friday is still wide open!  Maybe we will go
tobogganing in the park.  What are you doing for March break?

<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2l7me3">Here's an article</a> from Scientific American about how
a focus on your kid's effort — not their intelligence — is the
key to success in life (and school).  The bottom line is, either
your kid believes that she's smart and successful because she was 
born that way (a fixed intelligence mindset) or she believes she's 
smart and successful because
she works hard and practices (a growth mindset).  In either case,
eventually your kid is going to run into something she can't
succeed at effortlessly.  If she has a fixed intelligence
mindset she will give up on that thing, assuming
that it's just something she's not good at.  If she has a growth
mindset she will just try harder and harder.  Children with
fixed mindsets will also be scared to try new things, and to make
mistakes, for fear that they will be "outed" as someone who isn't
so smart after all.
</p>
<p>
So your kid needs to know that intelligence isn't intrinsic but
is something that can be changed and improved, and she needs to
know that being intelligent isn't much use without a good dose
of hard work and courage.  That's why I am not impressed when
my kids are smart; of course they are smart.  It's what they
do with themselves that I am interested in.
</p>
<p>
This issue is close to home for me because I grew up with a
very fixed mindset and it has taken me years to shake it.  It
also caused me to make some decisions I still regret now.  
Basically every time I wasn't instantly successful at something
I would give it up, and I was absolutely petrified of making
mistakes, so I never took any risks.  I 
would like my children to be bolder, less fearful of failure 
and mistakes, and to work harder than I did as a child.  (And
as an adult, now that I mention it.)
</p>
<p>
Here's an interesting paragraph from the article for Kat — this
ties into something we were talking about the other day:
</p>
<blockquote>
Mind-set can affect the quality and longevity of personal relationships as well, through people’s willingness—or unwillingness—to deal with difficulties. Those with a fixed mind-set are less likely than those with a growth mind-set to broach problems in their relationships and to try to solve them, according to a 2006 study I conducted with psychologist Lara Kammrath of Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario. After all, if you think that human personality traits are more or less fixed, relationship repair seems largely futile. Individuals who believe people can change and grow, however, are more confident that confronting concerns in their relationships will lead to resolutions.

<p>Last night I was browsing the newest iTouch apps, and I saw one called
<a href="http://www.iamas.ac.jp/%7Eaka/iphone/#LEDBanner.app">LEDBanner</a>.  It
allowed you to scroll text across your screen as if your screen was a
set of LEDs.  My only problem with it was that I couldn’t
programmatically change the text.  Fortunately the source was
available, and so, with only minor changes, I now have <a href="static/blake/LEDBanner.zip">a
version</a> which
lets me change the text to whatever I want.</p>
<p>For instance, the following scheme code:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>#! /usr/bin/gsi
(define (flmod x y) (fl- x (fl* (floor (fl/ x y)) y)))
(define (%100 time) (flmod (floor (time-&gt;seconds time))
(fixnum-&gt;flonum 100)))
(define (f)
  (begin
    (with-output-to-file
      (list
        path: "~/Library/Preferences/org.akamatsu.LEDBanner.msg"
        truncate: #t)
      (lambda () (display (%100 (current-time)))))
    (thread-sleep! 3)
    (f)))
(f)
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>changes the text every three seconds to the number of seconds, modulo
100.  Which turns out to be a mostly-random number, as shown below.</p>

<p>One of the things I wanted to add to <a href="http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/~chris/iphone/WifiToggle/">WifiToggle</a> was having the
icon show you whether your wifi was on or off, by having the switch be
up or down (and the blue glow be on or off, since in Australia a down
switch means that the light is on, whereas in Canada, it’s the
opposite).  Sadly, it didn’t seem possible, since Springboard<sup id="fnref:sb"><a class="footnote-ref" href="blake/tech/iTouch/updatingicons.html#fn:sb" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
seems to cache your icon.png, and ignore any updates you do to it.
And so that was where I left it for a long time…</p>
<p>Recently, however, I was browsing through <a href="http://ericasadun.com/?p=176">AppFlow</a> and I noticed that the MobileCalendar
application’s icon was different than the one in Springboard.
Specifically, the one on AppFlow was blank, whereas the one in
Springboard showed me the current day and date (i.e. "Saturday" and
"1" for today).  How did it do that?  I grabbed the source, and
grepped through it for the answer, which turned out to be a special
key in the Info.plist:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>SBIconClass<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>SBCalendarApplicationIcon<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
</pre>


<p>When I set WifiToggle’s SBIconClass key to be the same, I too had the
day and date drawn on top of my icon!  Partial success!  So now I’m at
the point of trying to figure out if I can use any class that
implements the correct interface (I’m thinking specifically about
adding a class to my application to handle the updates.)  Of course, I
have no idea what that interface is, but hey, I’m way closer than I
was this morning, so that’s got to count for something.</p>

When I went to pick Delphine up from school this afternoon,
she burst into tears as soon as she saw me.  One of the
other moms pointed her out to me; "Isn't that yours
crying up there?"  The teacher,
a substitute, said "She just started crying, I don't know
what happened!"  
</p>
<p>
I asked Delphine, "Did something happen?"  She shook her
head.  "Did someone do something?"  No.  "Did you lose 
something?"  No.  "Did you hurt yourself?"  No.  "Are
you going to tell me why you're crying?"  No.  So I
didn't press the issue, and we started walking home.  
After we had said goodbye to Delphine's friend and
walked a few more steps, Delphine said "There was
a different teacher, and Mrs Hollister said it was
going to be Mrs Green or Mrs Turk and it wasn't any
of them!  And we had music in the gym, not in music!
Everything was too different!"  And she sobbed.  She
went on to detail further how things were different 
(she had lunch at a friend's house instead of home,
and the gym was all set up for a concert, not like
normal).  She was really upset!  I remember hating 
things to be different when I was a kid, so my heart
went out to her.  Once we got home we read a book and
cuddled on the couch, and she seems to feel better
now.
</p>
<p>
I hope things aren't so different tomorrow!
