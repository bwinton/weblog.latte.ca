We have this old Fisher-Price toy camera from the 
seventies — it
was Blake's as a boy — and it's a toy version of the
old 110 cameras, remember them?  It has a flash cube on the
top which rotates 90° every time you take a picture.
(Dave, I think we might have had the same one, I
remember it or something like it.)
</p>
<p>
So despite this "camera" being completely unlike 
any camera the girls have ever seen, they have
taken to it very well and pretend to take pictures 
all the
time.  "Say 'banana'!"  
</p>
<p>
Cordelia, however, takes
it one step further.  After taking the picture,
she runs up to you, turns the camera around and
shows you the non-existent screen on the back;
"See yer picture!  See yer picture!"

I gave Delphine and Cordelia each a lollipop after 
lunch today, and wow, was it ever quiet with two 
gobs stopped up with candy!  When Delphine was
halfway through hers, she said, "If I were going
to name this thing I'm eating, I would call it
Lick Sticks.  Because you lick it, and it's a stick.
It doesn't pop, and you don't lolly it!"

<p>
She has a future in marketing.

Delphine and I have been reading some classic
chapter books about kindergarteners, like
<em>Ramona</em> and the <em>Betsy</em> books.
(By the way, if anyone can recommend any other
books/series in that vein I would love to hear
it!)  I am struck by how early these kids walk
to school alone: specifically, early kindergarten.
Ramona was written in the sixties and Betsy
was written in the thirties.  So, apart from
the cars which I agree are a concern, what has
changed in the world since then that prevents
us from letting our kindergartners walk to school?
Nothing.  But we don't because of some irrational,
formless fear that Something Bad will happen to
our children if we don't supervise their every
move.
</p>
<p>
I'm thrilled to find a website of people who
don't want to wrap their children in bubble-wrap,
and I'm astonished I didn't find it before now:
<a href="http://freerangekids.wordpress.com/">Free
Range Kids</a>.  I don't have time to read much
now but I'm looking forward to exploring this
website!  And in the meantime I might even let my
kids play in the front yard without supervision!
I'm a maverick.

Cordelia is so funny and verbal that I think
we almost take the cute things she says for
granted, but I'm going to try and write some
of them down for posterity, and Delphine's
too!
</p>
<p>
Today,
Cordelia had just woken up from her nap and 
she accompanied me into the bathroom while
I peed.  After I finished peeing she said
"You need paper?"  I agreed and she got
me one little piece of toilet paper, crumpled
up into a tiny ball.
</p>
<p>
I looked at it and  said, "I have to get some 
more because my bits are very big."
</p>
<p>
She said, "I like your hairy and big, strong
bits!"
</p>
<p>
"Thank you!"
</p>
<p>
"And also your slippers."

I'm posting this here mainly so Dave can enjoy some 
schadenfreude about our fair city and so Sascha
and Leontine can see the messier side of Toronto.
Oh politics, why must you be so hard?

(Delphine is almost five and Cordelia is two and a half and a month.)
</p>
<p>
It's 8:03 in the morning, and the girls are out on the deck.
It's about 10 degrees outside so they both have on sweaters,
and Cordelia has on mismatched wellies.  They are lounging
on the lounge chairs (the "relaxing" chairs) and playing
"Ah ah ah!" with a crow.  The crow says "Ah ah ah!" and
they say "Ah ah ah!" back.  Blake stood at Delphine's
window (which overlooks the deck) and said "Ah ah ah!"
and Cordelia started giggling.
</p>
<p>
Delphine loves to go outside every morning right after
breakfast, now that it has warmed up (the weather, not
breakfast).  She has explored
every one of the thousand square feet back there, and
she keeps track of what is growing for me.  Right now
the fiddleheads are coming up, and it's all I can do
to stop her from picking them all to eat.
</p>
<p>
Cordelia is at that stage where she 
overgeneralizes grammatical rules, so she "holded"
my hand or she "moveded" back.  (I'm not sure what
that double-suffix thing is about, but it's pretty
cute, in a Gollum-esque way.)  Anyway, that's
cute enough but Delphine has started doing it too,
which is awesome.  I like that she's learning things
from her sister, even if those things are wrong.
I'm sure they'll get sorted out sooner or later.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
8:17 am: Cordelia is sitting at the dining table
drawing with crayons.  She says "I'm drawin' a
hyclops!  The hyclops goin' to have hair..."
And she talks herself through the whole picture.
She likes drawing cyclopses because she's 
still at the stage where her drawings are mostly
circles and lines.  Circle, circle inside, 
two lines sticking out; ta-da!  Hyclops! 
</p>
<p>
Delphine is making pictures of all different houses.
She drew a condo, and a boathouse, and the roof of
a house, and a round house, and just a regular house.
</p>
<p>
This morning Delphine told me she had a bad
dream, but she changed it to be a good dream.  There
were monsters, and she had writing on her skin 
which told the monsters there was something inside
her, but she told the monsters that the stuff 
inside was stuff they didn't like, muscles and
bones, not something good like money and treasure.
Then she flew away, and the monsters couldn't fly.
She triumphs in her dreams!
</p>
<p>
It must have been a good night for bad dreams, because
Cordelia woke up twice with bad dreams, too.  Maybe
Delphine can teach her how to make her bad dreams
go better.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
It's 2:42 pm which means I should go and wake up 
Cordelia so we can go pick up Delphine.  Cordelia
has only been asleep for about an hour; I put her
down a little later than usual because there was
a guy here aerating our lawn and I had to pay him.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, this morning we went to the library to pick
up the thousands of books Blake and I had on hold,
and to get some books for the girls.  The girls got
another Alfie book by Shirley Hughes, and a few more
picture books.  I got a couple for Delphine from the
"Advanced Picture Books" shelf.  I must also remember
to order a new chapter book for her; we just finished
"'B' is for Betsy" by Carolyn Haywood.  We read
a couple of books while we were there; Delphine picked
out a book about a farmer, but she was very disappointed
when it turned out to be just a counting book.  She
is getting too old for probably about half of
the books in the picture book section of the library.
I think we might have to switch to a bigger library,
but I don't want to; I love this library and it's so
handy.
</p>
<p>
After the library we went to the toy store to get 
something for Ursa, who is turning 5 this weekend.
The girls were supposed to help me pick something
out, but they got distracted by the train set.
There was a little boy playing with the trains too,
and they did 'dinosaurs knock over the trains'
and 'look out, sheep, don't get hit by a train!'
and all kinds of other train/plastic animal hybrid
games.  I finally got them to help my pick some 
little things out, and we headed home.
</p>
<p>
Lunch was peanut butter and Marmite on leftover 
buns (I forgot to make bread <em>again</em>).  I
made Delphine a snack of oatmeal cookies and prunes
(no, she's not constipated, she just really likes
prunes) and we were off to school.  After I dropped
her off, Cordelia and I headed home, the lawn aerator
guy was here, and that's the end of that story, mostly.
After he was done I overseeded the lawn and seeded the
border we are converting to lawn.  I know, it's madness.
I need to come up with something better to do with my 
backyard, but
in the meantime grass seed is cheap.
</p>
<p>
Now I'm going to wake up Cordelia and get her something
to nibble on while we go back to the school to pick up
her big sister.
</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>
Cordelia had a couple of oatmeal cookies to nibble on,
and I put her in the big double stroller to go pick up
Delphine. Usually we take a smaller stroller, but 
Delphine stubbed her toe really badly in the morning
so I thought she might need a ride home.
</p>
<p>
After school, Delphine stopped and played with her
friends for ages, as usual.  School is out at 3:15
but we're lucky if we get home before 4:15.  As usual, they
started off playing in the school play structure, 
sliding, jumping on the wobbly bridge, and, 
increasingly, climbing the various climby bits –
ladders, ropes, tires, and so on.  Then they moved on
to playing right at the far end of the playing field,
apparently in the dirt.  I think they like it over
there because they're so far away from their Mums
and grandmothers and so on.  Finally we Mums got 
them moving by promising a few minutes of play
on "Big Hill", the sloped lawn at the front of
the school.  (Obviously Delphine's 
toe was no longer bothering her.)  We finally
managed to leave with only some of the usual
hysterics, and came home to a dinner of pancakes
and bacon and mango and fried tomato.  Sometimes
I like to have breakfast for supper, just for 
fun.
</p>
<p>
We skipped bathtime in favour of
reading some books, and then it was into pajamas
and into bed by 7:15.  I make that sound easy,
but often there is some debate as to whether
and when it is necessary to put on pajamas,
brush teeth, tidy bedrooms or go to bed.  Usually
we all agree on reading a book or two, though.
</p>
<p>
Blake got home, as usual, sometime in the middle
of bedtime and joined in the mess of brushing
and reading and fighting.  After the Smalls were in
bed we Bigs took the laundry off the line and folded
it, cleaned the kitchen, Blake had his supper, 
we watched a couple of <em>Daily Shows</em> and
went to bed.
</p>
<p>
And that's a day in the life.

<p>As <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/iTouch/languages.html">I mentioned</a> before, I’ve
ported Gambit Scheme to my iTouch, and have been playing around with
it a little.  It’s pretty nice all in all, but I recently ran into a
small problem while I was trying to play around with macros.  The
problem?  There’s no way to enter a backtick (`) on the iTouch!  That
means that I don’t really have a way to write code like</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="o">`</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nv">a</span> <span class="nv">b</span> <span class="o">,</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nv">d</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>which makes writing macros a lot more painful.  Fortunately, I got a
lot of help from the people on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/gambit">IRC</a>
and on the <a href="https://webmail.iro.umontreal.ca/pipermail/gambit-list/">Gambit mailing list</a>.
Specifically, Marc Feeley, the author of Gambit, <a href="https://webmail.iro.umontreal.ca/pipermail/gambit-list/2008-February/002011.html">posted</a>
a snippet of code that I could put into my .gambcini file that would
add $ as a synonym for `.  The code looked like this:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">begin</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">##</span><span class="nv">readtable-char-class-set!</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">current-readtable</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="sc">#\$</span>  <span class="c1">;; the character to dispatch on</span>
    <span class="no">#t</span>   <span class="c1">;; this character is a delimiter</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">re</span> <span class="nv">c</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">##</span><span class="nv">read-quotation</span> <span class="nv">re</span> <span class="o">#</span><span class="err">\</span><span class="o">`</span><span class="p">)))</span>  <span class="c1">;; handler</span>
  <span class="no">#f</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>and the example, which works, is:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="nv">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">,</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nv">output:</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>If you’re trying to write that code on your iTouch, you might notice that it
includes the forbidden `, and so you’re once again out of luck.  Except that
in this case, you can replace #\` with #\u0060, which you can type in on the
iTouch, and then it’ll all work.</p>

Spring has arrived with an unlikely two sunny warm days
in a row, over a weekend!  We celebrated by playing in 
the muck.  We raked most of last fall's leaves off the
front and back lawns, and I cleared off and weeded 
some of the north border in the backyard.  I pulled
out about a ton of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glechoma_hederacea">creeping
charlie</a>, which is surprisingly satisfying to uproot
when the ground is soft;
you can get hold of a bit without breaking the stem 
and then reel in about a foot of plant and roots, like
a magician pulling scarves out of a hat.
</p>
<p>
We also uprooted some of the many raspberries, and I cleaned
out some of the raspberry patch.  There are dozens of plants
there and it's hard to get the leaves and twigs and weeds
out from between them, to say nothing of trimming out the
dead canes, pulling out the millions of little suckers, 
and removing the raccoon poop.
I think the smart thing to do with the raspberry patch will
be to thin it out as well as reduce its overall footprint.
The previous owners must have really like raspberries.
</p>
<p>
There are lots of little things growing, but the only things
flowering yet are crocuses.  I'm not sure what the other
things are so I'm looking forward to their flowers.  Some
tulips I planted last fall are coming up in the front yard;
Delphine is very excited about that because she helped me
plant them.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most remarkable accomplishment this week was that
Blake built a frame for our 
<a href="http://www.squarefootgardening.com/">Square Foot Garden</a>.
That's a technique for vegetable gardening whereby you plant
your entire garden in one (or more) four-by-four foot squares.
We picked out the spot for the garden and Blake was poking 
around in the shed and found four perfect four-and-a-half foot
planks, which he screwed together into a frame to delineate
and protect the garden.  I say this casually, as if Blake
screws things together to make other things all the time, but
if you know Blake you know that just isn't so.  He is not 
what you might call "handy".  However, he made a perfectly
lovely frame without swearing or drawing blood, so I think
he might be handier than either of us suspected.  The frame
is gracing our garden and waiting patiently for some nice
compost and lots of seeds.

<p>Last night, I finally got the garage door open, after it had been
frozen in a block of ice for most of the winter, and got my bike out.
So this morning, I biked to work for the first time in, uh, I don’t
even know how long.  It was a pretty sweet ride, all in all.  There
were any number of reasons not to do it; my biking jeans are dirty,
it’s too cold, I couldn’t down-shift, but as always there was one
reason that trumped them all.  I wanted to ride again.  And so I did.</p>
<p>Some of the things I forgot about during my hiatus were how good that
first cup of coffee tastes after you’ve been riding in -5° weather,
what a rush it is to pass cars as they’re sitting, idling in
stop-and-go traffic, and how invigorated I feel when I finally get to
the office, and sit down.  Oh, also how sore my butt is.  Damn, that’s
a small hard seat.  I can’t wait to get used to it again.</p>
<p>Well, that’s about it.  I made it in safely, and I’m sure I’ll be
doing it again, and again, and pocketing the $22.50/week that would
have gone to the TTC, to spend on random upgrades.</p>
