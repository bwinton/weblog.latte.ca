<p>A few days ago, the city closed <a href="http://tinyurl.com/69xc2l">the pedestrian
bridge</a> at Summerhill (and MacLennan) in
order to tear it down and replace it.  Since then I’ve been trying to
find a way across the railroad tracks that doesn’t involve taking a
major road.  And I’ve totally failed.  So from now until September
28th, I’ll be biking down Bayview and turning right on Nesbitt before
dispy-doodling my way over to Glen Road.  It’s not my favourite route,
since the traffic on the Bayview Extension is going a fair bit faster
than I’ld like to, and the lane isn’t wide enough to share at those
speeds (and the right-hand side of the lane is brutally cracked and
very difficult to ride on, particularly at 50 km/h), but I still think
it’s better than Mt.  Pleasant.</p>
<p>Looking closer at the map, there <em>might</em> be another route, if I can
get into the path leading South from <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5vkh8y">David A. Balfour
park</a>…  Yeah, that might be a route to try
on my way home tonight.  I’ll reply with a comment, letting both of
the people who read this know how it was.  ;)</p>

<p>This year, <a href="http://arbrown.latte.ca/">Amy</a> and

<em>I</em> decided to try the Tour de Dufflet, and convinced Amy to come along
with me, but that’s the same, right?  I took a few
notes<sup id="fnref:route1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="blake/random/biking/tourdedufflet2008.html#fn:route1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:route2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="blake/random/biking/tourdedufflet2008.html#fn:route2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:route3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="blake/random/biking/tourdedufflet2008.html#fn:route3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:route4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="blake/random/biking/tourdedufflet2008.html#fn:route4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:route5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="blake/random/biking/tourdedufflet2008.html#fn:route5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> on which routes would
be less likely to have a lot of traffic on them, and after my parents
picked up Delphine and Cordelia, we set out.  46 km and 4 hours later,
we arrived home, tired, sore, and full.  I think it was mostly a
success, although Amy was certainly done having fun by the time we were
on the third leg.  The stats were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average speed: 15.0 km/h</li>
<li>Total distance: 46.18 km</li>
<li>Biking time: 3:04:32</li>
<li>Total time (including eating cake): around 4 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve got to say, I’m really pretty impressed with how well Amy did.  To
go from virtually no bicycling to a 46 km trek (and a 46 km trek with a
self-admitted speed freak) is something that a lot of people would skip
out on, or avoid, but she went for it, and went faster than I hoped she
would.  Would we do it again next year?  My guess is no, since it wasn’t
a lot of fun at the end.  On the other hand, if Amy continues to bike
throughout the year, she might just go for it, to see if it’s gotten any
easier.  (I’m hoping to do it next year, as you might have guessed from
the url of the post.)</p>

Delphine and Cordelia have really started fighting in
earnest, sibling-style, lately.  Previously they got in
little tiffs about who should play with which toy, or
who should be on what side of the bath — sensible
stuff — but now they just bicker for the sake of it.
The other day I heard this:
</p>

<p>
Delphine: "You're a pest!  You're Ramona!"<br>
Cordelia: "No I not Ramona!  I not in a book!"<br>
Delphine: "Yes you are!"<br>
Cordelia: "This in't a book!"
</p>

<p>
But later that same day Delphine retreated to her
room for half an hour and emerged with four pages
stapled together with a drawing of a princess to
colour in, some dotted lines to trace over and
letters to copy.  It was an activity book for
Cordelia, and on the first page she titled it
"UORVAREFRSTBOKK".  ("Your Very First Book")  She
spent all that time and thought to do something 
nice for her sister.  That's how I know she really
loves her, even though she is a pest.
</p>

<p>
Delphine's writing is progressing (although as
you can see she doesn't know about spaces 
between words, internal vowels are sporadic, and
she prefers ALL CAPS) and she loves 
to write things down.  The trend now is to let 
little kids just write things down anyhow and 
work on spelling later; it's called inventive
spelling and for me it mainly reinforces how
difficult and random the English language is.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday Delphine decided she wanted to write
down some girl names that she liked, in case she
has a girl baby.  Here is what she came up with:
</p>

<p>
<u>GORLS</u> (That's the title.)<br>
GABREELA (Gabriella)<br>
MEGI<del>M</del>N (Megan)<br>
MEG<br>
LVEA (Livia)<br>
HEG (Hedge — I don't know why this is on her list)<br>

<p>I’ve recently installed a new version of Sketches, and today Delphine
asked if we could draw another picture.  So we did.  Then we emailed
it to Amy, and I got Delphine to tell me what letters to write for her
sentence.  (I also told her about putting a space between each word,
which is something that Ms. Hollister said that we could tell her
about if we wanted.)</p>
<p>The sentence was “Ths is a heis on a hil wth to bsis.”, which I’m sure
you can all read as “This is a house on a hill with two bushes.”.</p>

<p>I knew when I woke up this morning that it would be an annoying ride
in.  It was raining fairly hard, but there was a breakfast at <a href="http://www.thebikejoint.com/">The
Bike Joint</a>, and they usually have one
of the better breakfasts.  It’s the same coffee, muffins, bagels, and
fresh fruit as filling.  As it turns out, this year they got an
espresso machine, so instead of the normal coffee, I had a very nice
latte along with my chocolate chip muffin, but along the way I got
almost completely soaked and tore a hole in the crotch of my biking
jeans.  The hole wasn’t a complete surprise; the other side had gone a
couple of weeks ago, and I had patched it with some old t-shirt.  I
guess it’s time to re-do the patch, and extend it to cover both sides.</p>
<p>Anyways, I got there, had some coffee and a muffin, and as I got on my
bike after crossing the street when I noticed that my rear wheel
didn’t really feel right.  I looked behind me and found that it had
gone completely flat while I was standing around eating breakfast.  I
wheeled the bike back to <a href="http://www.thebikejoint.com">the store</a>,
Derrick replaced the tube, and I was on my way just as it started to
rain again.  And then my front light fell off and broke into three
pieces.  Fortunately, that was easy enough for me to snap back
together, and be on my way once more.</p>
<p>After all that, I ended up being late for the 10:00am Status Meeting
at work, which was the cherry of annoyance on top of the annoying
ride.</p>
<p>The rest of the day, so far, has gone much better.  I listening to a
not-particularly-interesting <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5oag85">talk</a> about
bicycle touring at <a href="http://www.mec.ca/">MEC</a>, and while I was there
bought a bell.  My current bell works just fine, but it’s one of the
<em>ding</em>-<em>ding</em> ones, and no-one seems to recognize it as a bike bell,
so I got one that goes <em>ringggg</em>-<em>ringgg</em>, which is the canonical bike
bell noise, and I hope that’ll help.  Work is good too, if a little
busier than I might like.  And I finally got emacs working with
Markdown pretty much the way I want, so all in all, woot!</p>
<p>(Update: The ride home went mostly well, although there were spatters
of rain throughout the trip.  Around Sherbourne and Bloor, my rear
tire started to slow wayyyy down, and then stop.  When I flipped the
bike over, I noticed that it was jammed right up against the frame, so
I loosened it, straightened it, re-tightened it, and kept on going.
Still, that’s never happened to me before, and was pretty strange.)</p>

On Friday, Cordelia (who is two and eight months) decided she 
was done wearing diapers and wanted to wear underwear.  She has
decided to wear underwear before with mixed results, but 
this time she was really adamant about not wearing diapers,
not even pull-ups.  So she wore underwear, I accompanied her
to the bathroom after meals and her nap, and she went the 
whole day without an accident.  Saturday she had three
accidents but mostly because we weren't on the ball with
taking her to the bathroom at regular intervals.  
Notably, after her first accident, Blake (who didn't
yet understand the depth of her determination to 
wear underwear) tried to put her in a diaper and she
was mortified!  She was furious and miserable until I
explained to her that she could wear underwear and
everyone has accidents.  Since Saturday she hasn't had
any accidents.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, in Saturday we sold her crib, the one
the people at work bought for Delphine, and now Cordelia
is sleeping in the toddler bed.  She is big!  She 
will get really mad if you call her "little".

<p>
So that's it, I don't have any babies any more.

Delphine turned five this Saturday, and we had a party 
on the deck.
Delphine invited five of her friends, and between food
and cleaning up and decorating and games and loot it
was almost as much work as a grown-up party.  But
now the house is clean!  Ish.
</p>
<p>
The night before her birthday, Delphine slept over at
Baba and Zaida's house.  Baba wanted to take Delphine
to <a href="http://www.sciencerendezvous.ca/">Science
Rendezvous</a> in the morning, and I had a book club 
meeting Friday night, so a sleepover was advantageous
for all.  
</p>
<p>
Saturday dawned bright but not as early as usual; 
we had put Cordelia down early on Friday so between
that and not having Delphine around to wake her, 
she slept in until 7:45.  (Did you know if you put
your kids to bed earlier they sleep later?  Weird
but true.)  We got up and leapt into action; Blake
and Cordelia picked up flowers and bread and pickles, I cleaned
up and made egg salad and iced cupcakes and put up
the daisy decorations Delphine had made.  After 
lunch we put Cordelia down for an early nap, and 
Auntie Morgan came over to help out.
</p>
<p>
The party started at 2:00, and Delphine only got
home a few minutes before that in time to put on her new
red party dress.  All the partiers arrived on time
—Ursa, Erika, Tina, Sydney, and Athena, and four
out of the five Mums stayed, which was cool; also
in attendance were Baba and Zaida and Auntie Morgan
and Uncle Erik —
and we got into the swing of things: crafts, a treasure
hunt (the treasure was wrapped boxes of Nerds),
some dancing games (they didn't seem to enjoy those
much), Pass the Parcel (that was a huge hit), and
of course little sandwiches, chips, cake, ice cream
and jelly (Jell-o, except made with real juice).
(That was a really long sentence with altogether
too much punctuation.)
There was a good bit of random running around the 
backyard, too, which was more popular than I 
expected.
</p>
<p>
Delphine mostly had a good time — she got mad
at me when I didn't take her suggestion for a
music game (who knew "Row Row Row Your Boat" was
even a game?) but otherwise it was nice.  There is
some weird bullying/power abuse going on with
one of the girls and we tried to ameliorate that
as much as we could, but Delphine wasn't directly
involved so it didn't seem to bother her.  We'll
have the "victim" over for a playdate sometime to
make her feel more welcome and loved.  (She — the
victim — is
a very intensely affectionate little girl, and 
that annoys the others a bit, and so they are
mean to her – they say she can't play with
them.  Not surprisingly she's also
intensely emotional so she takes it seriously
when someone says something hurtful.  It's a 
mess; I'm so glad I'm not a little girl any
more!  That sucked!)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, apart from that the party was a hit, and
Delphine got some great presents and had a lovely
day.   
</p>
<p>
In addition
to turning five, she has also grown two centimeters
in the last month, and she can now read upside-down.
Well, she can't properly read books and stuff, but
she's getting pretty good at picking out individual
words as long as their spelling is "standard".  I
guess the memorization of non-standard words really
begins once you start reading in earnest and encounter
those words more.  (Although of course she can read
"one" and "two" which are non-standard, so I guess 
she has already started to build up that database.)
She's working on learning to ride a bike without
training wheels, and to skip.  Five is going to
be a very exciting year!

Okay, more on the free-range kids thing.  Look at this
map, showing how the habitat of an English eight-year-old
has shrunk in four generations; it's wild!

My mother, as a child, was one of those "get out of the house and
don't come back until six o'clock" kids but my brother
and I stayed more close to home.  The best bit was 
when "home" was five acres of land.
