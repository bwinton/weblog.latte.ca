<p>Okay, one game in particular this time.  One of my favourites from
back in my Palm days.</p>
<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=297288395&amp;mt=8">Bike Or Die 2</a>.<br><img alt="I can totally land this!" src="images/blake/iTouch/BikeOrDie.png"></p>
<p>It’s awesome.  It’s harder than I remember the Palm version being, but
that's probably as much because I'm out of practice as anything else.
After a couple of weeks of playing the beta version, I’m now at the
point where I rarely hit the wrong button, even though they're
on-screen instead of being hard buttons.</p>
<p>Not only is it a great game for what it is, but it’s got a ton of
<a href="http://bike.toyspring.com/levels.php">user-created levels</a>, and an
online <a href="http://bike.toyspring.com/view.php">high score board</a> (which
I’m <a href="http://bike.toyspring.com/player.php?p=35">nowhere near</a> the top
of).  The re-playability of this game is stunning.</p>
<p>If you're still undecided, you can read <a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=1318">the
thread</a> about it
on TouchArcade.  (Yeah, I’ve been answering a bunch of questions over
there.)  There’s also <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bikeordie">a video</a> showing
gameplay from the beta.</p>
<p>Finally, it only costs $2.99, but I hear it’s going up to $7 after the
introductory period is over.  (I suggested he sell it for $7.99-$9.99,
but he’s apparently a nicer person than I am.)</p>
<p>(No, he’s not paying me for this.  Heck, I didn’t even get an iTunes
gift certificate for all my hard work finding bugs.  I just really
like the game.)</p>

<p>Last night a friend asked me why I was excited that
Barack Obama won the American election.  Why, as
a Canadian, do I care?  I couldn't really begin to
explain in a Twitter post, and I was tired, but
I thought about it as I went to sleep and here is
what I have come up with.</p>
<p>I like Americans.  I know lots of them and I like most
of the Americans I know, and for a long time I have been
perplexed by the apparent gulf between "America" and 
the American people I know.  Last night's victory 
closed that gulf; it seems America the country is
a lot more closely aligned to the beliefs and hopes
of the America I know than to the vocal minority of
fundamentalist and fear-mongers we have heard from
of late.  And thank goodness for that.  So I am very
happy for my American friends, that finally their
government reflects them.</p>
<p>I like what this victory says about America.  I have
a friend who was predicting a McCain win: "The young
people won't wait in line to vote", he said.  "The 
early results with show a strong lead for Obama and
everyone else won't bother to vote", he said.  There
was an argument put forth that Americans <em>say</em> to
pollsters that they would vote for an African-American,
but then in the privacy of the polling booth their
secret inner racist comes out.  I am glad those
arguments were wrong.  I am glad America got excited
about its future and came out to vote in droves,
many for the first time, many waiting in line 
(or on line) for hours.</p>
<p>Why am I glad?  Because Americans are people, and
people are the same everywhere, and if Americans 
can get excited about democracy and step up and do
the right thing, it makes me feel better about people
everywhere.</p>
<p>I'm glad Barack Obama won because he ran an honourable
and decent campaign.  Everyone pisses and moans about
negative campaigning, mud-slinging and pettiness, but
it seemed, until now, inevitable, like the weather.
Obama has proved it's possible to win an election
with a positive, optimistic campaign.  (Okay,
maybe rather vague, but vague in a positive way.)
While McCain and Palin were screechin' and spittin',
fear-mongerin' and fist-shakin', Obama maintained his composure 
without condescending.  This is a great lesson for
American politicians and a great lesson for politicians
everywhere in the world.  The bar has been raised.</p>
<p>Obama is smart.  Really smart, and America is crying
out for a smart person in the White House.  Why
does this matter to me as a Canadian?  Because I
am excited to have someone in office who has a hope
of understanding and acting on 
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2008/11/how-green-will-president-obama.html?DCMP=ILC-arttsrhcol&amp;nsref=specrt12_head_Green%20White%20House">climate change</a>, a global issue if ever there
was one.  Where America leads, the world follows
and we desperately need someone to lead us in the
right direction on this matter.  (Apparently Canada
isn't going to do it.)</p>
<p>It's not just climate change.  The world faces
numerous potential global threats: a flu pandemic,
a disaster in our fragile food distribution system,
terrorism, peak oil.  Not to mention whatever the hell
is going on with the economy.  It's fine, I guess, to have
a numbskull in office when there's not much to do,
but when anything could happen I am much happier 
knowing that there is someone in the most powerful
position in the world who has a hope of really understanding
the situation, consulting with the right people and making
an informed decision without resorting to dogma and
superstition.</p>
<p>And I'll admit it: I got caught up in the excitement of
the moment.  (I still am; I am dying to sit down and
watch the Stewart/Colbert special from last night!)
Obama is the "other" to so many Americans: he is
black to white Americans, he is educated to uneducated
Americans, he is foreign-raised to Americans who have never
left the country, he is the son of an African to 
slave-descended Americans
(although I never heard anyone talk about that), he
is the son of an atheist and a lapsed Muslim to
Christian Americans, he
is erudite and witty and Northern and liberal(ish); he
is so many things that we have heard that Americans
aren't (Real Americans, that is) and yet America voted
for him.  That so many people were able to see past
the things they don't share with Barack Obama
and see in him the best of their common humanity
stirs in me great pride and hope
for what has been and could again be a great nation.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here are some more links:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obama could be <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/dn15130-obama-promises-new-era-of-scientific-innovation.html?feedId=online-news_rss20">great for science, yay.</a>
</li>
<li>Here's <a href="http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/dn15134-obama-on-science-in-his-own-words.html?feedId=online-news_rss20">Obama on science in his own words</a>
</li>
<li>The wonderful Dale McGowan points out that Obama is the <a href="http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/blog/?p=1078">first 
  American president raised in a non-religious
   household</a>
</li>
<li>Mr Crankypants (PZ Myers) sounds the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/the_glass_is_half_empty.php">voice of pessimism</a>.  I tend to agree with his commenters -- can't we have just one day of irrational exuberance before we get real?  (Mr Crankypants posted a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/context.php">follow-up comment</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know if Barack Obama is going to be as shiny as his
most enthusiastic supporters make him out to be.  I don't know if any
mortal could be.  But I am excited about what this
election says about America and I am optimistic
about the future.  Why not be?</p>

<p>Yesterday Blake taught Delphine about contrails.  This
morning we were out walking and she looked up into the
clear blue Hallowe'en sky and saw a plane.  "It has a
cotton-trail!"</p>
<hr>
<p>We were talking about everyone's costumes.  "Mrs
Thompson was a lady who works in a
church.  The ladies who wear necklaces with a criss-cross
thing on."  I love that my kid doesn't even know
what a cross is.  (Mrs Thompson was a nun.)</p>
<hr>
<p>Cordelia and I were reading <em>Dr Suess's ABC</em>:  "Big
A, little a, what begins with A?"  </p>
<p>"AMY!"  </p>
<p>"Aunt Annie's alligator, A..a..A.  Big B, little B, what
begins with B?"  </p>
<p>"BLAKE!"  </p>
<p>"Barber, baby, bubbles, and
a bumblebee."  And so on with Cordelia chiming in
whenever she knew someone with that letter.  After
C ("CORDELIA!"), D ("DELPHINE!") and E ("ERIK!") she
said "Almost everyone we know has a letter in this
book!"</p>
<p>Yeah, almost!</p>
<hr>
<p>Delphine and I were talking about meat today, because
we were walking over to a friend's house to pick up
a quarter cow.  She asked if someone killed the cow, 
and I said that they did.  </p>
<p>"That's sad.  We should
be nice to animals."</p>
<p>"That's true.  But then we couldn't eat meat."</p>
<p>"Meat is tasty."</p>
<p>"Some people don't like to kill animals, so they don't
eat meat.  They're called vegetarians."</p>
<p>"But meat is so tasty!"</p>
<p>"I know!  It's a hard decision to make."</p>
<p>So we talked about how Daddy and I decided to keep
eating meat but to try and make sure that the cows
and chickens and other animals we eat are happy
when they're alive, hence the trek to pick up 
cow.</p>
<hr>
<p>Not my kid but my friend's kid (and my kid's friend)
Ursa.  Yesterday they were eating a Chinese beef
dish and Ursa said "I like this dark brown chicken!"
(Good thing, because they got a quarter cow too.)
What's the deal with kids thinking everything is
chicken?  The other day Cordelia called tilapia chicken.
The kids at daycare used to call tofu chicken.
No wonder everything tastes like chicken, it's because
chicken tastes like everything!</p>

<p>Our school website contains a list of handy Hallowe'en
safety tips, among them the old chestnut about
inspecting kids' candy before they eat it.  I suppose that wouldn't 
hurt, but it might be interesting to know that there
has never been a case of random poisoned 
Hallowe'en candy.  There have been a few
reports of candy with pins, and apples with
razors, but the vast majority of those were hoaxes
or pranks.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of links from the valuable 
Snopes website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.snopes.com/horrors/poison/halloween.asp">On poisoning</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.snopes.com/horrors/mayhem/needles.asp">On needles and razors</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps it seems harmless to continue repeating
these needless warnings, but I think it breeds 
cynicism and fear, which we have far too 
much of.  (Don't even get me started on "Stranger
Danger".)</p>
<p>(I'm going to have to think further about the appropriateness
of cynicism and/or fear with respect to Chinese
candy.)</p>

<p>We're in the midst of the fall festive season, and
as anyone who is less than four feet tall knows, 
that means it's Hallowe'en.  Both Delphine and Cordelia
are very excited, and it's clear that Cordelia
remembers a thing or two about last year.</p>
<p>Delphine is planning to be a penguin this year.  We haven't bought a penguin costume; rather we
are hoping to kludge something together with 
a white shirt and a black hoodie and orange 
construction paper beak and feet.  I hope it
works because we haven't had a chance to
try it out and we're running out of pre-Hallowe'en
weekend.  Delphine has a pretty convincing penguin
waddle which would sell the lamest costume,
though.</p>
<p>Cordelia has independently decided to be a black
cat.  For a while there she was going with
ghost and I thought we would have to find and
then butcher a white sheet — you always see
that white-sheet-with-holes ghost costume in
cartoons and stuff but I've never seen it
in real life.  I thought it would be cool to try
it out.  But about a week ago she switched
to black cat, so I dropped a whopping $19 on
ears and a tail, which together with black clothes
and some eyeliner whiskers will make a convincing
and adorable cat.</p>
<p>The great thing about Hallowe'en is that it gives
you lots of chances to talk about such topics of 
childhood interest as death and scary things.  Last
year we spent a lot of time talking about being dead
and what death is (and who Death is — a house around
the corner has an inflatable Grim Reaper).  This year
we are leaning more towards Hallowe'en imagery and
what is scary.  Delphine wanted to know why someone
had fake gravestones on their lawn.  "Gravestones
aren't scary", she said.  I said they mark where dead people
are buried, but she was unmoved by that because to
her mind dead people aren't scary.  And of course 
by extension, skeletons aren't scary either.  What
<em>is</em> scary?  Witches, spiders and ghosts are apparently
scary.  I don't think bats are and rats definitely 
aren't, although we did decorate with black rubber 
rats.</p>

<p>Delphine likes Monopoly.  I know, weird.  I wouldn't
have occurred to me to put her in front of a game of
Monopoly, but my friend Tanya, who is nothing if not
ambitious with what she exposes her kid to, brought it
over and Delphine loves it.  She loves the money: she
likes to sort it out, stack it up, pay for things and
get money from other people.  She likes choosing which
piece she will be, and she loves to move around the
board.  She got tired of it, though, after maybe forty minutes,
and started acting up.  "I'm so bored of giving people
money!"  Yeah, tell me about it.  So for Christmas I
got her <em>Monopoly Junior</em>.  I'm normally not in favour
of kiddified versions of things, but this looks like
it retains the main elements of the adult version
(including the lovely money) but goes faster.  Plus
the setting is a carnival, not some boring old city.
Delphine loves carnivals and fairs and things.</p>

<p>Cordelia went for her birthday sleepover at Auntie
Morgan's house this weekend.  Unfortunately I have
no idea what they did because Cordelia said she had
fun but she didn't want to talk about it.  I know
what Delphine did, though, because she stayed home
for what we have termed a "sleepunder", which is
what you get when you're the sister who stays
home and has Mum and Dad to herself.  Mostly we
played Monopoly.  Delphine chose KD for supper, and
we read lots of chapters at bedtime because we
didn't have to put Cordelia to bed.  In the morning
Delphine decreed that Blake should get up early (that
is, when Delphine and I got up) and join us for a 
breakfast of French toast and pancakes.  Then more
Monopoly, and then we went out to get Cordelia back.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, the thing with Blake getting up with us turned
out abysmally.  Usually he stays in bed for an hour
or more on weekend mornings while I get up with the
kids and make breakfast and read the paper.  Having
missed that extra sleep, however, he was logy and 
grumpy all day.  He napped twice but it didn't help.
God knows what he's like during the week, but from
now on I will gladly let him get his morning beauty
sleep.)</p>
<p>The sleepunder was lovely.  Unfortunately at the moment the girls
are much more pleasant to be around one at a time than
together.  Delphine alone is insightful and contemplative
and interesting, Cordelia alone is funny and clever and
demonstrative.  Together they are whiny and scrappy 
and tiresome.  Not all the time, but often enough that
it wears me out.  Hopefully between them they will eventually
grow out
of it and figure out how to enjoy each other's company
more.</p>

<p>Cordelia is three!  She has been three for almost two weeks now!
We didn't have a big party or anything, because she doesn't
really have any friends yet, and also I couldn't be bothered.
I asked her what kind of cake she wanted and she said "a
tomato cake!"  Apparently there is such a thing, but I didn't
feel up to that kind of experimental weirdness, so I asked
her (on a different occasion) whether she would like a
chocolate cake or a white one.  (This is how you get little
kids to do what you want, you trick them and then you
paint them into a corner.)  She said she wanted a white cake
with chocolate icing (this is how they get what <em>they</em> want).
And since she had been talking about having a tomato birthday
for months, I drew three juicy tomatoes on top of the
cake in red icing.  That seemed to satisfy her.</p>
<p>We didn't have a party, as I mentioned, but a few people
did end up coming over for cake: Baba and Zaida were there,
and Tanya and Douglas and Ursa and Otis came too.</p>
<p>Cordelia's choice for her special birthday dinner was sushi,
so Zaida kindly brought over a platter of sushi from our 
favourite place.  Extra kindly, because his car wouldn't
start!  He walked it halfway over to our place and
Blake met him and brought it the rest of the way.  What 
these men wouldn't do for their little girls.</p>
<p>Cordelia really seems to have bought into this three thing.
Her new favourite word is "why", in that reflexive way 
little kids ask when they're trying to get as much information
into their little brains as possible.  She has stopped 
fighting so much with Delphine, and is generally more
easy-going lately.  We don't lock horns so much over
silly things like which way her toast is sliced.</p>
<p>Her latest favourite book is a counting book called
"Ten Black Dots" by Donald Crews.  We've read it at every
nap and bedtime for the last week.  She likes to point 
at the dots and count them, which she now does perfectly,
even down to pointing to each dot exactly once.  She 
can also do rudimentary math in her head, adding or
subtracting one or two.  I said rudimentary!  Generally 
she seems more numerically-oriented than Delphine was
at her age.</p>
<p>She's also really big!  Actually she's right on the 50th
percentile, but dammit, she seems big to me.  I'm still
coming to terms with the fact that my baby days are behind
me.  I know that means that also behind me are spit-up and
leaky boobs and diapers and baby gates and food allergy
scares and chokable object embargoes, and ahead of me are
piano lessons and baking together and interesting conversations
and going for walks and joking and reading and doing crossword
puzzles.  But I've been a baby-mummy for five years; it was
such a huge part of my life — it was my whole life! — for
such a long time and yet it's already over.  How can that be?</p>
