<h4>Kids' Fiction</h4>
<p><strong><em>The Treasure at Greene Knowe</em></strong>, and
<strong><em>The Stones at Greene Knowe</em></strong> <strong>by Lucy Boston</strong> are books
in a series I started reading last year, about an old
house with lots of secrets and ghosts and things. 
I have always loved books about houses with lots of
secrets and ghosts, hidden passageways and so on,
and this series is no exception.  It's very well
written and I'm looking forward to sharing it with
Delphine.</p>
<p>I had to pick up <strong><em>A Coyote's In The House</em></strong> <strong>by 
Elmore Leonard</strong> because I wanted to know how he would
handle young adult fiction.  Well, first of all he
managed to contrive a situation in which he could
legitimately use the word "bitch" a lot.  Kudos!  This
is a book written from the point of view of a coyote
contemplating the life of a domesticated dog.  The
characters are well-drawn and the story is good.
I liked this book.</p>
<h4>Adult Fiction</h4>
<p>I read <strong><em>Life on the Refrigerator Door</em></strong> <strong>by Alice 
Kuipers</strong> because it was recommended in the <em>Globe
and Mail</em> Books section, and because I was intrigued 
by the premise: the book is written almost entirely in 
notes between a woman and her teenage daughter, left,
as you might guess, on the refrigerator door.  Surprisingly
enough, the conceit works and the story is well-told.
It's a tear-jerker but ends on a hopeful note.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bad Monkeys</em></strong> <strong>by Matt Ruff</strong> is a book which
Blake got me to read because he really enjoyed it.
It's a SF mystery thriller about a vigilante assassin, full of
plot twists and lies within lies which keep you guessing
and manage to hang together right to the final page.
It's one of those books which, upon finishing it,
you immediately want to start it again so you can see
if it all fits together properly.
A great book if you like that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I put <strong><em>I Am Legend</em></strong> <strong> (and other stories) by Richard 
Matheson</strong> on hold
at the library back when the movie came out — I do that
a lot, read books which have been made into movies 
without bothering to see the movie.  I am often intrigued
by the premise of a movie but know that the book will be
better (not to mention cheaper).  Anyway, everyone else
in Toronto did the same thing before me so it took ages
for my turn to come, and the memory of the unseen movie
had long faded by the time I got the book.  I like horror,
though, so I gave it a read and quite enjoyed the title
story.  It's the story of a guy who remains uninfected
when a disease very  much like vampirism spreads over the
world.  Kind of a cool post-apocalyptic story with a 
grim but satisfying ending.</p>
<p>I started reading the other stories in the book, but
they were all kind of samish and didn't do much for me.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Bone Garden</em></strong> <strong>by Tess Gerritsen</strong> is a book
my mother sent me, a mystery about a lady who finds some
bones in her garden and goes off to Maine to investigate
them.  It was pretty good.  I've seen some people say
that Tess Gerritsen is really great and she's won a 
couple of awards and been nominated for an Edgar, but
this book didn't blow me away.  Maybe I should read
<strong>Vanish</strong>, the book which got all the awards.  (Except
apparently the Toronto Public Library doesn't have a
copy.  Go TPL!)</p>
<p>I picked up <strong><em>Alice in Jeopardy </em></strong> <strong>by Ed McBain</strong> and 
<strong><em>Watchman</em></strong> <strong>by Ian Rankin</strong> in summer as my
fluffy, mindless reading.  I chose them because
I like the authors and that's what the library had on
the shelves, and I managed to get a McBain book that
isn't an 87th Precinct book and a Rankin that isn't
a Rebus book.  However, they were both pretty good reads, 
definitely fulfilling what I required of them.</p>

<p>I joined a book club in 2008, in part to force me to read
more fiction, and to think about what I read more.  In
spite of how much I read — well, maybe because I read
so much — I don't think about what I read as much as
I would like to.  Knowing I'm going to have to talk intelligently
about the books forces me to read more mindfully, which
improves all my reading.</p>
<p><strong><em>My Sister's Keeper</em></strong> <strong>by Jodi Picoult</strong> is a book
about a girl, Anna, who is born to provide her sister 
Kate with bone marrow.  Kate gets better but then
gets sick again, over and over, and Anna keeps getting
tapped for more and more biological matter.  I quite
enjoyed the book, I think (it was a while ago, but I
know I didn't hate it, except the ending which was
egregiously heart-rending), and there was plenty to talk about: the
ethics of designer babies, issues of identity and
responsibility to family, and a bizarre subplot about
a lawyer with an anachronistically shameful disorder
of his own.  Pretty good but don't run out and read
it or anything.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Girls</em></strong> <strong>by Lori Larsen</strong> is a book about 
conjoined twins living in a small town near London,
Ontario.  This is a beautifully crafted book, not
just about the sisters but about life in small-town
Canada.  I found the characters so compelling and real that 
I kept feeling I could Google them to find out their
ultimate fate.  The one weird thing is that although
the girls in the book are almost my exact contemporaries
I kept feeling the book was set in the fifties or
sixties.  I don't know if that was intentional on 
the part of the author, to evoke the nostalgia of
small-town life or of the cloistered nature of the
girls' lives, or not, but it quite jarring when one
of the sisters started looking things up on the
Internet herself.  Other than that I really enjoyed 
this book.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Friday Night Knitting Club</em></strong> <strong>by Kate Jacobs</strong>
is about a New York woman who owns a knitting store
and has a teenage daughter and meets up with an old
friend and, I dunno, hilarity ensues.  As you might
guess I wasn't overwhelmed with love for this book.
It was fluffy like a ball of mohair and seemed
contrived.</p>
<p><strong><em>Last Days of Dogtown</em></strong> <strong>by Anita Diamant</strong> is a
book about the various inhabitants of a dying town
on the Massachusetts coast.  It's gloomy reading
but compelling.  The characters are well-drawn and
the stories are interesting and credible.  A worthwhile
read.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Memory-Keeper's Daughter</em></strong> <strong>by Kim Edwards</strong>
is about a woman who, upon being asked to take a 
doctor's baby daughter, born with Down syndrome, to
an institution, instead kidnaps the daughter and
takes her to live in Pittsburgh.  Meanwhile the 
doctor tells his wife that the baby died and they
go on to have a messed-up marriage and never quite
find happiness.  A bunch of things happen and 
everyone lives happily ever after, more or less.</p>
<p>This was another good book which didn't blow
me away.  It seemed quite contrived and book clubbish,
with lots of Talking Points and Dramatic Turns.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ender's Game</em></strong> <strong>by Orson Scott Card</strong>.  Yes, we
read <strong>Ender's Game</strong> in book club.  Weird!  About
half of the book club members don't read science
fiction, so it was an interesting meeting.  Anyway,
so this is another book about a kid who is born
for a special purpose, this time to be the child
genius who saves mankind by having the a unique
combination of video gaming skillz and innocence
required to defeat an alien species which threatens
mankind.  You have to suspend your disbelief pretty
high over a couple of things in this book, but if
you give yourself over to Card you're rewarded with
a good yarn and some interesting things to think
over, like the ethics of using children to fight
wars, and the similarity between modern warfare
and video games.  Also the techniques of military
training, the value of adding in bits to a book which
don't really make sense in that book but pave the way
for a sequal, preemptive war, genocide, whether we 
could recognize the "humanity" in alien species, and
what form those species might take, collective 
intelligence versus individual minds and the inability
to truly know another person. Lots to talk about.</p>
<p>I actually read <strong>Only You Can Save Mankind</strong> by Terry
Pratchett as a companion piece to this (according
to Blake there is a whole subgenre of "video games
that turn out to be real" SF out there).  They're
quite different books but they're neck and
neck in terms of quality of characterization and
depth of insight, with Pratchett coming out ahead
with Humour over Earnestness.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Thousand Splendid Suns</em></strong> <strong>by Khaled Hosseini</strong>
is my big winner this year, in terms of fiction.  This
book ripped me up.  The writing is gorgeous and the
characters are instantly compelling, but the plot
is gruelling and horrifying.  I wept for the women 
in this book, and at the same time I learned so much
about Kabul and the recent history of Afghanistan.
I sent my mother a copy of this book and she read it
in two days.  Fantastic book.</p>

<p>I'm not sure where to post this, but I saved it because it
rings so true for me.  It's
from Robert Sapolsky's Essay, "Mountain Gorilla and Yeshiva Boy", in
<em>Curious Minds: How A Child Becomes A Scientist</em>.  He
describes an epiphany:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...<em>There is no God.  This is gibberish.</em></p>
<p>Since then, I've had no religion, in fact no capacity for spirituality
of any sort whatsoever.  There is no facet of my life — love, parenting,
mulling over why we are here — that I view outside the context of
mechanistic science.  For me, there is no Divine Watchmaker — no top-down
volition, no purpose, no cause beyond what emerges from the complexity
of biological systems.  This is no a cold point of view: I am as
intensely emotional now as I was at the age of thirteen, and I don't find
science and emotionality to be at all contradictory.  Nor do I believe
that science is an emotional substitute for religion.  But for me, it
has finally made the religious worldview impossible.</p>

<p>Here are the parenting books I read in 2008, sorted
into two categories:</p>
<h5>Books that Made me Say "Enh"</h5>

<p>These are books which were pretty useful but didn't
change my world view or particularly affect my 
parenting style.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><em>Curious Minds ed.</em></strong> <strong>by John Brockman</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Toilet Training the Brazelton Way</em></strong> <strong>by T. Berry 
Brazelton and Joshua Sparrow</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Children: The Challenge</em></strong> <strong>by Rudolph Dreikurs</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Parent Talk</em></strong> <strong>by Stanley Shapiro and Karen Skinulis</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Your Five-Year-Old: Sunny and Serene</em></strong> <strong>by Ames and Ilg</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong><em>The Highly Sensitive Child</em></strong> <strong>by Elaine Aron</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Siblings Without Rivalry</em></strong> <strong>by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong><em>The Money-Tree Myth</em></strong> <strong>by Gail Vaz-Oxlade</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Awesome Books</h5>

<p>These are the books which either blew me away with their
insight or actually changed how I view my role
as a parent.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Breaking The Good Mom Myth: Every Mom's Modern Guide to Getting Past Perfection, Regaining Sanity, and Raising Great Kids</em></strong> <strong>by Alyson Schafer</strong> is
about democratic parenting, the notion that kids are actually
much more competent than they are given credit for, and that
we must give them more responsibility to allow them to grow
into competent and independent adults.  (This philosophy
also says that we should allow our children to experience
the consequences of their decisions, which has unfortunately
led to people using "consequence" as a euphemism for 
"punishment".  If there's a point, some folk are bound to
miss it.)  </p>
<p>This book changed how I parent; I used to fret
so much about how to get them to tidy their rooms,
how to get them to dress appropriately outside, how to 
get them to play nicely together.  Schafer points out
that you can't really "get" kids to do things, but you
can treat them like human beings, explain the situation,
help them make their own decisions and then live with 
them.  The problem, of course, is that you have to live
with their decisions too, but as long as you remember that
your kids are not in fact tiny extensions of yourself, 
that's usually not really a problem.  The nice thing is
that once something is your kid's responsibility it's
no longer yours!  Hooray!
- <strong><em>Punished by Rewards: The Trouble with Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A's, Praise, and Other Bribes</em></strong> <strong>by Alfie Kohn</strong>.  I was
led to this book by the Schafer book, which is a bit
ironic because Kohn tears a strip off the democratic parenting
crowd for their euphemistic "consequences" and their
apparent lack of sympathetic support for little kids.
Anyway, this book is about how rewards (praise, stickers,
grades, incentives, commissions, bonuses) are actually
counterproductive in parenting and in business.  </p>
<p>Kohn is brilliant and very compelling and has
led me to fundamentally change my parenting style.
I now almost never praise the girls and never reward them,
and I am very conscious of intrinsic versus extrinsic
motivation in myself as well as them.  Absolutely everyone
should read this book, whether parents, teachers, employers,
managers, or anyone else.
- <strong><em>Parenting Beyond Belief: On Raising Ethical, Caring Kids Without Religion</em></strong> <strong>by Dale McGowan</strong> is a
collection of essays about raising children in a household
without religion or other superstition.  I was casting about
for support in this area when I discovered this book, apparently
the only one on this topic.  It's a great book, interesting
and funny and insightful.
- <strong><em>The Boy Who Was Raised As A Dog: And Other Stories from a Child Psychiatrist's Notebook: What Traumatized Children Can Teach Us About Loss, Love and Healing</em></strong> <strong>by Bruce Perry</strong> is
a book about how the development of children who have undergone 
extreme trauma can teach us about normal mental development.
It is fascinating, inspiring and at times grueling.  Another
must-read for anyone who has or works with children.</p>

<p>Back on November 17 when I started this blog entry I
had read about fifty books since the beginning of
the year.  I wrote up eight of them
and then got distracted (probably by reading, I think
I have read another ten at least since then) and haven't
worked on it since.  It's now December 23rd, and I 
would really like to post my book logs for this year.
The problem is I obviously don't have time to write
up each book properly, so this is going to end up
being a giant list of books I have read.  I hate to
do that because then it takes all the value-add out
of a book blog and seems a lot like bragging.  <em>Neener
neener, look at all the books I read, I'm such a
smarty pants.</em>  But I've come to depend on my book
blog to see what I have read and how I liked it, so
I'm going to go ahead anyway, and I'll try and
categorize things cleverly and hopefully write a little
bit about books which really had an impact, so this
isn't a completely worthless process.</p>
<p>But first, here are the eight books I wrote up back 
in November.</p>
<p>I ended up grouping all the books I've read into six
rough categories: books on parenting and childhood
development, memoirs, non-fiction books on other topics,
books I read for my bookclub, and other fiction.  (Okay,
that's five.  Degree in math, what?)  The
only thing which really surprised me was the number
of books I read which could be termed memoirs.  I
certainly don't consider myself a person who reads
memoirs.  As it turns out there is no particular 
pattern or commonality among the memoirs I read; each
one was chosen for some specific reason.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are the Non-Fiction (Other) books I read,
broken into "Books About How To Do Stuff" and "Other
Non-Fiction".  Perhaps that should be "Otherer Non-Fiction".
</p>
<h5>Books About How To Do Stuff</h5>
<p><strong><em>Houseworks</em></strong> <strong>by Cynthia Townley Evers</strong> is a book about how
to organize your house, or at least that's how it's billed.
The author is the organizedhome.com lady, and this is to
some extent a bookization of the website.  It works very 
well as a book, since getting organized is inherently a
somewhat linear procedure.  But it's not just an organization
book, it's really much more than that. It functions as a full
household maintenance reference, along the lines of <em>Home
Comforts</em>, by Cheryl Mendelson, although much less hardcore.
I got some helpful
tips from this book and I'm already pretty organized, so I
recommend it to anyone who feels they need a little help
in the housekeeping department.</p>
<p><strong><em>Knife Skills Illustrated</em></strong> <strong>by Peter Hertzmann</strong>.  Go
ahead and guess what this book is about.  It covers
what to look for when you are buying knives, how to 
care for your knives and keep them sharp, and knife
safety.   The second half of the book demonstrates,
through photographs, how to cut up various fruits,
veggies, meats, and the other stuff you might want
to dismember in the comfort of your own kitchen.<br>
Insasmuch as something as inherently physical and
three-dimensional can be taught in a book, this is
a handy book.  I still feel like I would learn more
in a half-hour face-to-face with an expert.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Naturalized Garden</em></strong> <strong>by Stephen Westcott-Gratton</strong> is
about how to grow a garden which takes care of itself, by
choosing indigenous and hardy plants suitable for the 
characteristics of your garden. This book discusses
woodland (or shady) gardens, meadow (or sunny) gardens, and
damp gardens.  (I can't remember the picturesque name
for damp gardens.)  The author recommends hundreds of
species and gives advice on planting and maintenance.
I love this book and it has inspired me to (gradually)
convert my back and front gardens to naturalized gardens.
Thanks to Auntie J'Anne I already have a nice patch of
hostas and ferns in the back, to which I added some
astilbe and plenty of bulbs (I got one of those 75 
bulbs for $30 deals, we'll see how they do).  To my
surprise I determined that the front of the backyard
(if you will) is actually reasonably sunny so I will have to
revisit the book sometime to get some meadow suggestions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Getting Things Done</em></strong> <strong>by David Allen</strong> is a book which
is very much discussed and followed on the Interweb.  I
decided to check it out after screwing up something which
seemed disastrous at the time but which I have now forgotten.
I hate that feeling of being out of control I get when I
miss something important or let someone down.  </p>
<p>The
author is an organization expert who has distilled all
his experience with executives into this amazing foolproof
n-step plan to get things done.  I had to know.  It actually
does seem to be a really good system, although somehow
the infrastructure doesn't entirely fit into my life, probably
because I don't spend a whole lot of time with pen and
paper, or computer.  You do need to spend a little time
on the infrastrucure of the system, but that's better than
spending the time looking for lost files or apologizing
to people for dropping the ball on things.  I did implement
some aspects of this book, most notably keeping little 
notebooks all over the place and writing everything down,
and also creating a file system for absolutely everything.
It has helped.  I will probably get it out again soon 
and see what other incremental changes I can make.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Global Warming Survival Handbook</em></strong> <strong>by David De Rothschild</strong>
is a really rather handy little book of ideas on how you
can act to reduce global climate change.  There are plenty of
good ideas in here, including big changes that will really
make a difference, like living in a smaller house, close to
work, and biking to work.  And the most important — changing
a lightbulb is good but changing a representative is better:
vote for the people who will make a difference.  (That's why
I voted Liberal.  Didn't seem to make a difference... sigh.)</p>
<p>I read this book in tandem with a little piece of crap that
calls itself something like <em>The Green Book</em>.  It's a bunch
of tips from celebrities on how you can prevent climate
change.  The other book was written with scientists, and if
I might advise you, when given the choice between taking
tips from celebrities or taking tips from scientists on 
matters of science, go with the scientists.  Celebrities 
have lots of great tips on, I dunno, mascara, but they 
don't know crap about climate change.  This book perpetuates
the nice myth that we'll be able to save the world without
too much inconvenience.  They suggest such profound changes
as using paper matches instead of wooden matches.  Not
taking a receipt at the ATM.  I think my favourite celebrity
advice was from Jennifer Aniston.  Apparently she saves
water by brushing her teeth in the shower.  Now unless
I'm out of touch and Jennifer Aniston is actually the
earthly manifestation of the multi-armed Hindu goddess of
destruction
Kali and can actually brush her teeth and soap up her
hoo-hah <em>&amp;at the same time</em>, brushing your teeth in the shower
is exactly the same thing as brushing your teeth in front
of the sink <em>with the tap running</em>!  Stupid, so so stupid.</p>
<p>The book is notable only
for it's amazing analogies: if everyone in America
switched to single-ply tissues, say, a wad of snotrag
the size of a cruise ship would be saved every year!<br>
They must have had a team of interns devoted to the 
creation of a giant database of various dimensions
and their pithy equivalents.</p>
<p><strong><em>When You Catch An Adjective, Kill It</em></strong> <strong>by Ben Yagoda</strong>.
I love a good grammar book but this one didn't grab me.
It's a long time since I read it so I can't remember
why.  Let's see what I wrote in my notebook... Okay, I
said I didn't really learn anything about parts of speech
(the topic of the book) because that stuff is inherently
boring, but I enjoyed the discussions of historical and
popular usage.</p>
<p>One thing that stayed with me is that "they" as the
gender-neutral pronoun was in use before "he or she",
so I will happily keep saying "they" when gender is
not specified.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Perfect Wrong Note</em></strong> <strong>by William Westney</strong> is a book
about musical practice and performance.  The author is
a concert pianist and teacher, and he has come up with
some new theories of musical training, practice and performance.
Mainly he doesn't like the traditional way of dealing with
mistakes: you make a mistake, you go back over the passage
and beat it into the ground until you can play it a time
or two without the mistake, and then you charge on.  His
contention is that the mistake is teaching you something
about what you know (or rather, don't know) about the piece.
You need to go back and figure out what the mistake is telling
you so you can correct it properly and deepen your understanding
of the piece.</p>
<p>He also has some interesting ideas about how to practice: that
you should treat it more like a physical workout than a mental
exercise, so start by relaxing your body and mind, stretching,
finding a comfortable and relaxed position.  Then play some
notes, make some noises.  Not music, just noises.  It's all
a little hippy-trippy but if I were an earnest student of 
music I would definitely try it.  I totally agree that the
making of music is as much an athletic pursuit as a cerebral one;
I never gained as good a physical appreciation for my body
and it's strengths and liabilities as I did when I was studying
voice.</p>
<p>There's one rather intimidating point in the book: Westney
encourages a profound knowledge of each piece you play — he
would like you to be able to verbally describe what is happening
at any point
in the piece.  For example, "In this bar, the piece 
retains the key signature of the tonic minor but modulates to 
its relative major of G flat"...  It's representative of
my limited musical knowledge that I had to use Google to 
find that technical-sounding phrase, and while I know more or less
what it means I'm not entirely sure it makes sense in this
context.  And it is very safe to say I have never known
or understood any piece I have learned or performed that
intimately.  It's amazing how clueless a choral singer can be
and get away with it.  And humbling to realize how little I know.
What did I learn in those eight or so years of piano lessons?
Apparently not much.</p>
<p><a name="fear">
<strong><em>Feel the Fear... And Do It Anyway</em></strong> <strong>by Susan Jeffers</strong>.</a>  I have
this sneaking feeling — maybe everyone has it — that I am not
living up to my potential.  I am smart, and organized, I can
talk to people, I can solve problems and understand complex
situations, and yet I am of no more value to the world than
any stay-at-home mother.  I feel like I should be contributing
more than I am.  I feel like, well, I'm wasting my potential.  This 
is a matter for an entire blog post, of course, and there's
more to it than I can go into in this paragraph.  Lucky you.</p>
<p>Anyway, at various points in my life I have
been given opportunities to do interesting or ambitious things and I have
passed them up, sometimes explicitly and sometimes just by
dropping the ball.  I realized this summer that I run away
from these exciting possibilities because I am scared.
Scared of screwing up, of letting someone down, of getting
in over my head, of becoming overwhelmed.  It seems like
a pretty straightforward thing, but it took my thirty-two
years to figure it out.  So, as I do when I have any kind
of problem, I headed to the library to check out a book about
it, and this is the one I chose because 
<a href="amy/books/_2008/non-fiction/" title="http://www.gailvaz-oxlade.com/">Gail Vaz-Oxlade</a> recommended
it, and she seems pretty sensible.</p>
<p>I found the book mostly helpful.  It had a few great insights
which seem, in retrospect, to be really obvious but which I
needed to have pointed out to me: no matter what happens, you
can handle it; other people are scared too, they just go ahead
anyway (that is, fear isn't a legitimate reason not to do
something); even if something horrible does happen, you can
get through it and find some good in it.    Jeffers talks about
moving away from being a victim, how to deal with that negative
chatterbox (that's my personal hobgoblin), and how to live a
balanced and meaningful life so that failure in one area doesn't
destroy your whole sense of self.</p>
<p>A couple of things didn't work for me: Jeffers loves affirmations,
but I find them contrived and dorky.  I do make a point to avoid
negative self-talk and strive for the opposite (or at least,
<em>realistic</em> self-talk) but I can't stand in front of the mirror 
and chant canned new-agey phrases.  That's not me.  Also at the
end of the book she gets into this woo-woo stuff about the 
Universe having a Plan for you and reaching your Higher
Consciousness.  I am don't believe in the supernatural and
I know the universe is just a whirling mass of elements with
no intention at all for me or anyone else.  I ignored those
chapters, without any detriment to the value of the rest of
the book.</p>
<h5>Other Non-Fiction</h5>

<p><strong><em>Madame Bovary's Ovaries: A Darwinian Look at Literature</em></strong>
<strong>by David P. Barash and Nanelle Barash</strong> is an examination of
literature through the lens of evolutionary theory.  Or is 
it an examination of evolutionary theory through the lens of
literature?  I'm still not sure.  I came into it with a little
understanding of literature and slightly more understanding
of evolution, and I left it with a much better understanding
of both.  To the extent that literature is really the
encoding of human nature, this book greatly increased
my understanding of how evolution as we know it informs the
way we behave.  Fantastic book, I recommend it to all 
inquisitive readers.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Geography of Hope: A Guided Tour of the World We Need</em></strong>
<strong>by Chris Turner</strong>.  The author, upon having a baby, realized
that the world is in very real danger of going to hell in a
handbasket.  Being a go-get-em journalist type, he decided to
travel around the world (I don't know how you get away with
that when you've just had a baby; he must have a very forgiving
wife) and figure out who is doing what to prevent that, and how's
it working out anyway.  He concludes that in fact the technology
already exists to save our collective asses, and that what is
required is the political will to implement it on a significant
scale.  (See above re: changing representatives as well as
lightbulbs.)  This was a fun and heartening read: Turner sees
hope and possibility in a green economy and culture.  Turner
continues to track developments in sustainable policy and
technology in his Globe and Mail column.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rethinking Thin: The New Science of Weight Loss — And the 
Myths and Realities of Dieting</em></strong> <strong>by Gina Kolata</strong> is an
overview of the history of dieting and the current scientific
thinking on obesity and dieting.</p>
<p>Kolata describes what happens to your body when you reduce caloric
intake: you become panicky and obsessed with food.  Once healthy
intake resumes, you rapidly regain weight.  Similarly, if you 
increase caloric intake and gain weight outside of your natural
weight range, you rapidly lose it again once you stop overeating.
That's why it's so easy for actors to lose weight if they have
gained it for a role (assuming they were within their own healthy
weight beforehand).  Bottom line: it's very difficult for people
to change their own weight.  There are numerous biological
checks and balances in your body to keep your weight consistent,
whether you like it or not.</p>
<p>This book challenges popular wisdom with its crazy old nemesis, 
data.  Apparently,
for example, changes in cafeteria menus
and physical education programs in an attempt to reduce obesity
levels in students don't make any significant difference.  Bummer.  Kolata also dicusses the fact that the danger of being
overweight (which is of course just a medical/social construct)
are overstated.  Being overweight — as opposed to obese, or
"normal" weight — is possibly optimal for good health.  It's
certainly not the medical disaster it is often made out to be.</p>
<p>The frustrating thing about this book is that it doesn't explain
why everyone is getting fatter, but of course that's because we
don't exactly know.  My opinion is that it's probably a perfect
storm of factors: ready availability of food, reduced need to
exercise, and possibly the effect of some novel chemical or 
combination of chemicals.  Only time will tell.</p>
<p>This book is a must-read for anyone who is overweight or
worried about their weight, and for anyone who feels they need
to have an opinion on fatness.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil</em></strong> 
<strong>by Philip Zimbardo</strong> Phil Zimbardo is
the guy who did the Stanford Prison Experiment.  You  know,
the one where they took a bunch of undergrad men, assigned 
half of them to be guards and half to be prisoners, and let
them at it in a fake prison constructed in a basement.  Obviously,
the experiment went terribly and it was finally stopped only
a few days in after an observer insisted it was cruel and
immoral.  The experiment ended but Zimbardo has never stopped
thinking about what makes normal people do evil things.<br>
He studied this experiement, as well as wars and genocides.
After thinking about it for years he wrote this book, which
I found profoundly interesting and useful.  </p>
<p>Zimbardo describes the circumstances you need to create
an environment where people behave evilly: group conformity,
obedience to authority, deindividuation (so lack of individual
responsibility), dehumanization and moral disengagement (so
the others are pigs, rats, cockroaches; anything but human),
Inaction and passive bystanders.</p>
<p>It's not just a
description of evil and how it comes about, but a how-to
of not being evil!  Everyone needs one of those.  I honestly
can't say, if I were in some awful situation like a genocide,
that I wouldn't be one of the bystanders.  I'm pretty sure
I wouldn't take a machete to my neighbours but I know I have
a weak, fearful, conformist,
deferential-to-authority streak that could see me looking
the other way while my neighbours machete each other.  "Well,
if everyone else thinks it okay," I would say to myself.  Or,
"Well if I say something I could be next.  I don't want to
piss off the guy with the machete."  Zimbardo addresses these
excuses and more.  If you want to learn how to not be evil
it's all there at the 
<a href="http://lucifereffect.com/guide.htm">Lucifer Effect website</a>.
They are good rules for living, not just for avoiding evilness:
admit mistakes; be mindful, be responsible, assert your 
individuality, rebel against unjust authority, value your
independence from groupthink... and so on.  Worth a look
at the website even if you don't have time to read the book.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Dirt on Clean</em></strong> <strong>by Katherine Ashenburg</strong> is all about
personal hygiene through history.</p>
<p>(This is where I stopped writing back in November, and
here end the long write-ups.  This book was neat but didn't
blow me away.  If you are interested in personal hygiene
through history, check it out.)</p>
<p>Here are the other non-fiction books I read before November
17th:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><em>Bonk</em></strong> <strong>by Mary Roach</strong> is a book about scientific research
into sex, written for a general audience.  Funny and interesting.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Only In Canada, You Say?</em></strong> <strong>by Katherine Barber</strong> is a book
about uniquely Canadian words and phrases.  Awesome book, notable
for the number of times I said "What the hell does everyone else
call it?"  Double-double?  Open concept?  Reno?  You people need
words for these things.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>The World Without Us</em></strong> <strong>by Alan Weisman</strong> is that book about
what the earth would do if people suddenly disappeared.  It's
awesome and thrilling and very informative.  And humbling.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Happier</em></strong> <strong>by Tal Ben-Shahar</strong> (Yes, I do get lots of book
recommendations from <em>The Daily Show</em>.) A book about how to
be happier.  I think this must have covered a lot of the same
material as the other happiness books I've read because nothing
stands out in my memory.  Still probably a worthwhile read if
you would like to be happier.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>The End of Food</em></strong> <strong>by Paul Roberts</strong> is about the incredible
fragility of the global food industry.  It could be laid low
at any time by disease, climate change, peak oil.  When you 
walk into the grocery store it seems as if there is such 
endless abundance, but it's really a house of cards.  Scary
but well worth reading.</li>

<p>'Tis the season for acquisitiveness, but honestly, I want
stuff all year 'round.  I don't expect anyone to get me
any of this, because we're not "doing" presents this
year and anyway Blake never buys me anything that he knows I 
want.  Some kind of perverse male pride thing, like not
asking for directions.  So this
list is really just for my amusement.</p>
<p>This is what I want right now:</p>

(Isn't it nice when you imagine your perfect whatever, and then it turns out someone else has designed and manufactured it?)</li>
<li>too many books to name.</li>
<li>ballerina-style slippers like <a href="http://www.landsend.com/pp/TerryTravelSlipperswithBag~188844_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::CHH&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_00002__0000000184&amp;origin=index">this</a>
</li>
<li>a new bra.  I've been wearing the same two nursing bras for three years now.  They are so done.  I'm not even nursing any more!  I also need another running bra.  Except I don't know what size I am, so I have to go to the store and get measured properly.</li>
<li>another computer so I can do computer stuff while we watch TV (our computer
  is our TV).  Actually Blake just bought a new computer so in theory
  I could borrow his.</li>
<li>protective <a href="http://ptpads.com/index2.html">table pads</a>; back before we
  even thought about having kids we bought an elegant, flawless 
  wood dining table.  Turns out it shows every scratch and fingerprint.<br>
  So now 
  I keep it covered with a cloth tablecloth over a vinyl
  tablecloth.  It looks awful but it works.  Now, those table pads I
  linked to look really tacky because apparently they haven't redone their
  marketing material since 1982, but I was at the house of a friend who
  has them and they actually look really great.  I thought she had a
  cool leather-embossed table at first.  They're only a couple hundred
  bucks and I really should have bought some by now.</li>
<li>a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5aolg3">long down coat</a> for those freezing

<p>A few Fridays ago, I was laid off from my job.  After seven years I’m
sort of out of practice at looking for a new job.  The economy is also
kind of slow, and I know a few people who are going to graduate soon
into this economy, and who might want to know what I did when I was
laid off, and how I’ve found a new job.</p>
<p>So, Friday.  As a side note, if you’re ever in the position of letting
go of employees, please don’t lay them off or fire them on a Friday.
They can’t do anything but sit and brood over the weekend, which can
really get them depressed.  On the other hand, I’ve been pretty upbeat
about it because after seven years, I’m kind of ready for a change.
It <em>was</em> a big shock when I first learned about it, but I had made my
peace with it after around 30 minutes or so.  An hour later, there was
a meeting where the rest of the employees found out, and that was kind
of tough to sit through, but afterwards it was like there was a big
weight lifted from my shoulders, and my co-workers and I started to
joke around about it.</p>
<p>That afternoon, and the next couple of days, I emailed my friends and
asked whether they knew of any companies that were hiring.  From that
I got six or seven leads, and three or four interviews, and finally
decided to do some work and sign a three month contract, which will
probably turn into a longer term contract.  I don’t expect it’ll turn
into a full time job, but that works out fine for me, since I expect
the market will have changed by the new year, and I’m hoping that a
friend of mine will get the hiring freeze he’s currently in lifted by
then, and hire me.</p>
<p>On the plus side, now that I’m working from home, I bought a new
computer because I can deduct the price from my income as a business
expense.  Similarly I can deduct part of the interest on my mortgage
from my income.  And I’ll be making a fair bit more than I was getting
as a full-time employee, because of the lack of benefits, my inside
knowledge of the app, and finally because I have had only one raise in
the last seven years.  (It was hard for me to ask for a raise, because
I knew the company didn’t have a lot of money to give me a raise with,
and because I owned some of the company, so I would rather have seen
my shares increase in value than get extra cash in the short term.  Of
course neither ended up happening, but who could have foreseen that?)</p>
<p>So yeah, there’s my tale of woe and hope.  It’s really not that bad,
apart from the sadness of seeing something that you worked really hard
for crash and burn.  But even in that sadness is the spark of
excitement for something new and different.  If you haven’t gotten
your first job yet, then I don’t know if this will help you all that
much.  I guess the main thing to take away from it would be that you
should cultivate contacts among your peers, profs, co-workers, and
clients because they’re the ones who will find you the good jobs, in
the end.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to see a presentation by Kosta Zabashta about the
work he did on Basie.  The presentation went fairly well, but while
listening to it, I had a few ideas that I thought I should write down.</p>
<p>First, since the configurations for Exim and Postfix are so
complicated and so different, it would be nice if we had a program
that could figure out which one you’re running, and generate the lines
to add to your config files to get it all set up.</p>
<p>Second, I think we probably don’t need to add that many boolean or set
operators to the search functionality.  I seem to remember reading a
paper a while ago where Google said that people only used 2 of the
advanced search features, "s to make a phrase, and OR to choose
between two different things.  Sure, some people used all the wacky
operators, but it was a vanishingly small percentage.</p>
<p>Third, do we update the search index when items change, or are we
constantly rebuilding it?  I would have thought that doing the dynamic
updates would have run into many of the same issues as the Events app,
but maybe there was a smarter way to do it that I’m overlooking.</p>
<p>Fourth, and finally, I wonder if there’s a way to use metadata about
the objects we’re searching to influence rankings.  To take the Google
approach, add the number of mail messages/commit logs/wiki
pages/tickets that refer to an item as a factor in determining the
ranking.  Or, push more recent things higher in the search results,
since we know when things were added.  Do we actually want to do
either of those?  Maybe, maybe not, but we’ve got a lot of data about
each item, and it seems like using it might be, well, maybe more
interesting than useful.  :)</p>
<p>So, there are my thoughts on stuff we might want to do for the next
version of Basie.  I suppose the next step will be to get Greg to link
to this, and get other people commenting.  (And now that I’ve written
it all out, I suppose it might have been cleverer to post this to the
Basie blog.  Ah well.  Live and learn.)</p>

<p>...independent!  We had Cordelia's parent-teacher "chat" today,
with her nursery school teachers.  I love talking about my 
children, so I was very excited to be there, and of course Blake
doesn't have a job so he came along 'coz he doesn't have anything
else to do.  Just kidding; he had taken the morning off to
come anyway, before the company folded (or whatever it's in
the process of doing).</p>
<p>Simone and Sameera were very happy to talk about Cordelia too.
Apparently she's a delight at school.  (I bet they say that
to all the parents.)  She's very independent; she puts on
her own outside clothes and clears up after snack by
herself.  This is a revelation to me because like idiots 
we're still helping her on with her snowsuit and boots,
and begging her to take just one thing into the kitchen
after meals.  Suckers, we are!</p>
<p>Her favourite things are sensory activities:
playdough, cornstarch, sand.  Anything messy.
She's still focused to the point of being oblivious to
what's going on around her (she gets that from Blake),
and she's happy playing by herself, to the point that
her teachers are actually engineering situations to
force her into talking and playing with other kids.  They
are going to hook me up with some good playdate matches
for her.</p>
<p>That's their only concern for kindergarten, that she
won't be able to make connections with other kids and
with the teacher.  Academically, in terms of colours,
shapes, letters and numbers, she's just fine!</p>
