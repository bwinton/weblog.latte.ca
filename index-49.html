<p>It's Thursday morning, which means no-one has to go
anywhere until Delphine's school starts in the 
afternoon.  This is good news because it's minus
ninety-five outside and I don't want to go out, 
but it's bad news because the girls have to 
negotiate each others' company all morning.</p>
<p>This morning they were doing Arts and Crafts.  Delphine 
is miffed because there's an Arts and Crafts afterschool
program and I didn't sign her up for it, but
fortunately she's pretty sensible so she
deals with it by doing Arts and Crafts (you 
can hear the capitals when she says it) on the
dining room table with Cordelia.  This goes well
for a while until Cordelia doesn't comply with
some requirement of Delphine's and the yelling 
begins.  Delphine is quite bossy: "You have
to draw a face on this person or I won't make
you another person!" </p>
<p>Cordelia is very stubborn: "I don't want to 
draw a face!"  Except Cordelia's
voice is very high and loud, and she isn't so 
good with consonants, so it's more like "I
DON WAN DRA FAY!"  Which is enough to get anyone's
ire up, and Delphine has a short temper as it
is, so Delphine crumples up whatever it was that
needed a face and declares that she doesn't want
to play any more.</p>
<p>I point out that if they don't want to play together
they each have their own bedroom, so Delphine goes
upstairs.  Cordelia starts to follow her.  "Don't
follow me!  I don't want you!"  Delphine slams her
door.  Cordelia tries to open the door and then
yells "I can't open the door!"  Well, "I CAN' OPE'
THDAH!"</p>
<p>I yell up "If Delphine has her door closed she can
have some privacy!" and Cordelia starts up with her
heart-rending sobs.  When this kid cries she puts
everything into it and you'd have to be made of 
granite to not feel bad.  She collapses on Delphine's
door.  "I love you Delphine!", she wails.</p>
<p>And then the door opens.  "I love you too, Cordelia."
And they hug, and now they're making worlds out of
buttons and Lego and cotton balls.</p>
<p>Friends, enemies, friends, enemies.  I think the
only thing harder than parenting sisters is being
one.</p>

<p>About six years ago I received in the mail a small tub of
NeoStrata AHA cream with 10% glycolic acid.  It was
sent to me by a friend who had tried it to cure her 
acne with no success.  To my surprise, shortly after I
started using it, my skin cleared up.  The clogged pores
that made my forehead into a shiny billboard of braille nonsense
disappeared, along with the pimples which had been with me
since high school.  I never had terrible acne, but I always
had one or two or three pimples on the go at a time, and
I always made it worse by picking.  Pick pick pick.</p>
<p>But once I started using the new cream, for the first 
time in my adult life I had clear, 
smooth almost-alabaster skin.  It's a small thing and
I feel like I shouldn't be so vain about it, but it was 
nice to walk around and not be self-conscious about
my skin.  Before the acne went away I thought I would
feel prettier if I didn't have these spots, and
as it turns out, I was right.  I felt prettier and 
more confident.</p>
<p>So every time I ran out of the glycolic acid cream I
went for a few days without it, just to make sure that
I wasn't wasting my money, and sure enough within a
couple of days the clogged pores would pop up on my
forehead, a sure harbinger, I thought, of the pimples
to come.  So off to the store I would go to spend another
$35 on the magic cream.</p>
<p>But now the pimples are back, just like before.  I have
a scar on my chin where I picked one last week, I have
a scab on my forehead and another at my hairline, and
I have a new pimple brewing on the other side of my
chin.  <em>Exactly</em> the same as before: same kind of pimples,
same places.  My skin is doing the time warp.  I actually
wore makeup the other day.  I never wear makeup!</p>
<p>So what changed, I asked myself.  I am using exactly the
same beauty routine as I was three months ago: plain soap
and the glycolic acid stuff.  What changed?</p>
<p>Then I realized: Cordelia stopped nursing.  Yeah.  I 
started using the glycolic acid cream when I was a few
months pregnant.  Then I had Delphine, then I nursed her,
then I got pregnant with Cordelia (without giving up 
nursing), had her and nursed her, until a couple of months
ago.  And then the acne came back.  But not the clogged
pores!  Apparently the cream cured them but wasn't 
actually having an effect on the acne.</p>
<p>It's almost funny (haw haw) how much time and money
and grief I spent between the ages of thirteen and
twenty-seven, trying to get rid of these pimples.  All I 
needed to do was get knocked up!  Ha!</p>
<p>So next time I go see the doctor I will ask her about
trying one of those birth control pills which cure
acne as a "side effect".  Since pregnancy cured it, 
perhaps something which feigns pregnancy will have
the same effect!  We'll see.  In the meantime I will
try and stop picking.</p>

<p>I found myself downtown today, with nothing really to do between 3:30
and 6:30.  I suppose I could have headed over to U of T, but it seemed
like sort of a long way to go just to connect to the internet and come
all the way back again.  So instead of making the trek, or wasting two
tokens, I took advantage of the 2 hours of free WiFi that comes with
my Starbucks card, and stayed near Yonge, drinking green tea with a
little honey, and investigating a few bugs for work.  After it runs
out (in another 31 minutes), I think I'm going to pack up, and walk
north to my next appointment, grabbing some dinner on the way.  If I'm
right, that should put me right where I need to be, right when I need
to be there.</p>
<p>Ah, if only everything in my life could fall into place this easily.
(The upgrade to Aquamacs 1.6 that I just did also worked out really
well.  Maybe today is just my day for doing stuff!)</p>

<p>So (obviously?) I've been thinking a lot about my beliefs
(or lack thereof) lately.  I came across this good quote
today from Dale McGowan, the guy who wrote the book about
raising children without religion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though I’m sure they exist, I have never yet met an 
atheist delusional enough to say he or she knows God does 
not exist. Atheism simply means “I don’t think God exists.” 
It is a statement of belief, based on the evidence as we 
see it, not one of certainty. But agnostic is too often 
misunderstood as a 50-50, “dunno, don’t care” position. 
That not really an agnostic, it’s an 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheist">apatheist</a>. I said 
that I am a teapot agnostic, then explained 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot">what that is</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually <a href="http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/blog/?p=1578">the whole post</a> 
is really good.  Anyway, I think I might lean towards apathetic
agnosticism, except that I find this stuff quite interesting to
think about.  And I quite enjoy not believing in stuff, which
isn't very apathetic of me.</p>

<p>I was chatting with a friend and former co-worker of mine today, and
asked him why I was never a part of the group guiding where the
company was going.  (Okay, I actually asked why I was never a part of
the management, but in retrospect that was the wrong question, for
reasons detailed below.  I should have asked the question I said
above.)  His answer basically boiled down to “You never wanted to be.”
One of the things he mentioned was that when I traded salary for extra
vacation days (something I was fairly proud of thinking of, since it
makes me an easier sell to the CFO, and the two are pretty much equal,
if you’re allowed to cash out unused vacation days), it indicated that
my priorities lay more with my family than with the company, with the
unspoken implication that that attitude isn’t one that will lead to a
position of power within the company.  That initial assumption led to
a series of misunderstandings, and miscommunications, until I was
effectively shut out of helping to guide the company.</p>
<p>I guess that’s fair enough, kinda, but it’s a shame that people think
that having interests outside of the office means that I’m somehow
less interested in the success of the company.  Particularly since I
didn’t take the vacation days, and was always intending on cashing
them out.  So, for my next job, I think I’m going to take that option
off the table, since I didn’t use the vacation days anyways.  (I had
27 days built up when I was laid off!)</p>
<p>I also asked him what I could do to get into management next time, but
I’m not really sure that’s really where I want to be.  I know a few
people who have moved into management, and then found it hard to get a
job when they were laid off.  Along the same lines, I still believe
I’m a far better architect and coder than manager, and so it’s sort of
foolish for a company to hire me for my managerial skills when my
coding skills are far superior.  And I really <em>really</em> like
programming.  <strong>Really</strong>.  With the spare time I had after I was laid
off, I wrote code for an iPhone game.  For fun I read up on
programming languages I haven’t seen before, and solve <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project
Euler</a> problems with them.  But I don’t
know if there’s a way to parlay my architecture and coding prowess
into the ability to help guide a company, since that seems to be the
exclusive province of people who manage other people.  (Of course, my
work on <a href="http://www.basieproject.org">Basie</a> last term also has me
wondering if I’m actually a mediocre manager, or if I may be better at
it than I always thought I was.)</p>
<p>I suppose there’s always one way to find out how good a manager/team
lead I am, and I expect I’ll start moving that direction in my next
job.  I can always write code on evenings and weekends, right?  Well,
either way, it’s not something I’ll worry about until I get another
job.  And certainly not something I should be worrying about this
late at night.</p>

<p><strong><em>Three Day Road</em></strong> <strong>by Joseph Boyden</strong>.  This was my 
over-New Year's Day book.  Joseph Boyden is kind of shiny
here in Canada these days because he just won some 
award, I think for his next book.  Okay, okay, I did some
research: he won the Giller Prize (sorry, that's the
Scotiabank Giller Prize) for <em>Through Black Spruce</em>.</p>
<p>This book is about two Ontario Cree who sign up to
fight in WW I.  Actually the book starts when one of
the men returns, and it's told mostly in memories,
the soldier's memories of war and his elderly aunt's
memories of her life.</p>
<p>I would have to say this was a very good start to
a year's reading.  It's a good story, I learned
a whole lot about World War I (which isn't saying 
much because I know next to nothing about World
War I anyway) and got lots of insight into Cree
culture, another embaraassingly large hole in
my knowledge, considering I claim to be from
Northern Saskatchewan, some of the time.  The
book is beautifully written.  I'll have to check
out <em>Through Black Spruce</em> too.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ja, No, Man: Growing Up White in Apartheid-Era 
South Africa</em></strong> <strong>by Richard Poplak</strong>.  Poplak was
born in 1973 and lived in South Africa until he was
sixteen, and ended up in Toronto.  I was born in
1975 and lived in South Africa until I was seven,
and ended up in Toronto.  So I thought this book would
be a cool read and might fill in some holes in my
memory and my understanding of my childhood.
The <em>Globe and Mail</em>
loved this book, and I too love the book.  It's hilarious
and again, very educational (apparently there are
no limits to my ignorance).  Poplak crams in a 
lot of South African history among his droll tales
of corporal punishment and weird racism.  This 
book made me really thankful we got the hell out
of dodge when we did.  It also made me laugh out loud.
(Dave, you should totally read this too.)</p>
<p><strong><em>It's All Too Much: An Easy Plan for Living a
Richer Life with Less Stuff</em></strong> <strong>by Peter Walsh</strong>.
I'm not sure exactly why I keep reading 
organizing books, because it's not like I'm drowning
in clutter.  I can have close friends and family
over almost without notice, and visits from 
less-close friends only call for maybe half an
hour of picking up and cleaning the bathroom.
So it's not like I'm a giant household screw-up.
But it's true that it wasn't always like this.
Our apartment was pretty hideous, and it has taken
me a long time to recognize how much ongoing effort
it takes to keep a house clean and tidy.  </p>
<p>The other thing is I like is to have less stuff, and
to only have the right stuff, and that's what this
book is really about.  Rather than just dig in to
all that <em>stuff</em> Walsh insists that first you think
about what you want from your life, what your dream
life really looks like.  Then he gets you to think
about what you want from your home, and then he gets
you to break it down by room.  For each room in your
house Walsh asks you to make a list of desired 
functions in the room, and get
rid of everything in the room which doesn't meet 
one of those functions.  Once the room is clean,
you designate a physical area for each function,
and then put everything away in the appropriate
area.</p>
<p>This is a good notion and something I might implement
sometime, to some extent, but I think the best 
thing about the book is the yearly schedule of
stuff to do to keep your place in line once you
have sorted it out.</p>
<p>Two other nice things about this book: lots of
anecdotes.  I love anecdotes.  Second Walsh has a
bunch of neat tricks for figuring out whether
you use stuff: turn all your hangers inside
pointing out, and only turn them back when you
wear the item outside of the house.  At the end
of the year, get rid of the clothes which are
still pointing the wrong way.  Or: masking tape
all your Tupperware closed and only untape it
when you use the Tupperware.  After six months
(preferably six months including Thanksgiving
and Christmas) get rid of all the Tupperware
that is still sealed shut.  Or, move all your kitchen
gadgets and utensils to a cardboard box and only
put them away in a drawer when you use them.
If you don't use them in four weeks, toss them.
I don't agree with that time-scale; I have 
useful kitchen tools that I use less often
than four-weekly, but then I think I'm more
of a cook than his target audience, who apparently
can't find their kitchen counters under junk 
mail and clothes that don't fit.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a good book; I enjoyed reading it
and it's helpful too.  I'm slightly embarrassed that I
have so much to say about this rather unsophisticated book and
apparently no more than a paragraph or two to say about the
real books I read.  I'm tired!  And I have rather more hands-on
experience with domestic organization than I do with apartheid
or Cree culture or WW I.  Not much excuse, I know.  Maybe I
need to work on being smarter.  Some more.</p>

<p>First off let me say I got one of my wishes: a computer of my
own!  To be sure, it's an ancient Toshiba laptop with no mouse,
running XP, but beggars can't be choosers.  It's a computer,
and it's so gnarly no-one else will want to use it!</p>
<p>Today is the last day of Christmas holidays.  At the beginning
of the two weeks off school, Delphine was pretty miserable.  She
likes school better than home, probably because school notably
lacks an annoying little sister.  Also school is thick with
structure and full of activities: she never has to wonder what
to do next at school.  So she and I both were a little nervous
at the start of the holiday.</p>
<p>The first weekend we attended the annual Party Across The Street,
the party the whole block goes to.  All twelve houses worth!  Delphine was feeling sick, though, so she only stayed for a little
while.  Sunday she was feeling better and good thing too, because it
was the first day of Hanukkah and we had my friend Kat over
for latkes and cabbage soup and some <em>Doctor Who</em>s.  We scared
the crap out of her with <em>Blink</em> and that one with the 
gas mask kid.</p>
<p>On Monday Delphine and I left Blake and 
Cordelia behind and went downtown to do some Christmas shopping.  Delphine 
has only been downtown a few times, not counting
swimming lessons on Bloor and Riverdale Farm, so it is still
a big adventure for her.  We went to the Eaton Centre, shopped
in vain for a winter jacket for Zaida, got some presents for
Daddy and had sushi and ice cream.  Delphine ooh-ed and aah-ed
at the Swarovski crystal Christmas tree, and at the fountain.
I told her the secret to finding a nice clean, empty bathroom
when the mall is busy (go to the top floor of one of the 
department stores), and we bought me some underwear.  Yay!</p>
<p>On Tuesday we went tobogganing with friends, which is to say we all
went to the park and then I peeled off to do some errands.
I meant to be back in time to toboggan, but by the time I
was finished shopping everyone had retreated to our friends'
place for lunch.  (It was the book store, the book store always
takes longer than you think.)  Then Delphine stayed at said 
friend's house for the rest of the afternoon for some
getting-away-from-little-sister time.</p>
<p>The next day was Christmas Eve.  Due to in-law difficulties (not
with my in-laws, though) we had decided to have Christmas Dinner on 
Christmas Eve, at Baba and Zaida's house.  (I know, there's just
something weird about Christmas Dinners at Baba and Zaida's
house.  We're a modern family.)  However, I'm obviously the
big Christmas maven (heh) around here and Christmas Dinner
is my baby, so I sent over three giant bags of food and 
equipment in Zaida's car in the morning, then drove myself
and the girls crazy cleaning our house while Blake worked.  It was a
pretty rotten morning but it was the only time this whole
Christmas season when I got stressed and overwhelmed, which
is a big improvement over last year when pretty much all of
December sucked.  After the house was clean enough I shoved
the girls over to Baba and Zaida's in a very unseasonable 
rainstorm, and Baba took over childcare/napping while I
cooked away.  I did prime rib (part of our quarter cow), roast
potatoes and Yorkshire puddings and gravy, and Baba did green beans.
For afters we had Christmas pudding (I made five Christmas 
puddings this year!  That might be too many!) with brandy
butter and whipped cream, and some of the vast selection of
cookies baked by Baba's friend Bob.  Bob starts baking in 
September or October and bakes, like twenty different kinds of
cookies and bars, and then disseminates his handywork to all
his friends.  Hooray for Bob!</p>
<p>After dinner we headed home and did all the Santa juju, with
the cookies and port (no milk for Santa at our house, we do it
English-style), and stockings hung
on doorknobs (Delphine) and dining chairs (Cordelia. Don't ask
me, it wasn't my idea) with care.  Delphine declared she was going to stay
up and wait for Santa, but Delphine couldn't stay up if there 
were a real live pony in it for her, and within ten minutes
she was gone.  Then I got down to the real hard Santa work
and finally crawled into bed by ten thirty or so.</p>
<p>The nice thing about having children who wake up really early
normally is that you're used to it, so when they wake up
really early Christmas Day it's not such a shock.  We had
coached the girls that they should open their stockings
<em>before</em> waking us up, so we got to sleep until 7.  Christmas
Day unfolded as it should, with some stocking opening, a light
breakfast, opening some presents.  The whole family and 
a friend came over for brunch, catered by Morgan and Erik, 
and there was ample sitting around talking and eating more
cookies and the traditional Terry's chocolate orange and
giant Toblerone bar.  Finally everyone left, and there was
more present opening.  Delphine declared herself to have
received too many books and activity books (and to be
sure, she did receive plenty of both) but I think she
ended up pretty happy.  Her favourite thing was a sewing kit
I put together out of some sheets of felt from the dollar
store, some fine yarn, actual grown-up needles and actual
grown-up scissors.  Actual grown-up stuff is a huge deal
when you're five.  I think Cordelia's favourite thing was
the baby doll she got from Baba and Zaida (technically
a Hanukkah gift).</p>
<p>Boxing Day was officially my day off: the house was clean,
the fridge was full of leftovers, and everyone was amused with
their new toys and books and activity books.  I had nothing
to do!  So I read my Christmas book (that collection of short
stories) in the morning and in the afternoon Tanya and her
brood came over and we ate more and compared schwag.</p>
<p>The next day we had Cordelia's friend Henry over for a
playdate and lunch.  Henry was a little sick and had a
minor meltdown and he and his Mom had to leave without
really enjoying their lunch, but the kids did get to play
a little bit.   Morgan came over for lunch too, and we
gave her her birthday present.  Later we had more latkes
with Kat and Baba and Zaida.  After the kids went to bed
Kat and Blake and I watched <em>Juno</em>, and I made Kat cry.
Christmas is hard.</p>
<p>Sunday no-one came over and we didn't do anything.  Delphine
was happy; I told her on Saturday the Baba and Zaida were
coming over and she said "I don't want any more company!"  She 
has very specific needs, that one.</p>
<p>Monday my friend Ellen and her million children (actually
three but two of them are louder or more rambunctious than
average) came over.  I love Ellen.  We always have fun when
she and her kids come over, but after this visit we decided that we
should try and get Dexter and Delphine together sometime
without younger siblings so they can play properly.</p>
<p>Tuesday we all went out together up Mount Pleasant to the
drugstore and the library and the toystore.  Delphine spent
her Christmas money, all five dollars of it, on a pocket
sized one of those little magnetic drawing pads.  She said
"it's just like Daddy's little computer!"</p>
<p>Wednesday, New Year's Eve, we all slept in until 8.  Normally
that would be great, but I had hoped to head down to the AGO
early.  I always like to get places early because usually 
they're less busy, and so that we can get home in plenty of time
for Cordelia's nap.  In reality we didn't get downtown until
11:00.  However, an hour at the art gallery is really all 
Cordelia's good for.  Delphine is at an awesome age for the
art gallery - she is becoming interested in how to draw
things "well", and we can talk about what colours the artist
uses, whether pictures are pretty or not, whether we like
them or not.  With Cordelia it's more, "Don't touch
that, Cordelia.  Please don't run, Cordelia.  Could you
be more quiet, Cordelia?"  We went for lunch at the food
court I used to go to when I worked downtown, and I had
a number 4 at New Thai Food: cashew chicken with sticky rice and papaya
salad.</p>
<p>Blake and I stayed up late on New Year's Eve, but it 
was pretty lame.  We ended up watching George Strombouloupoulos's
interview with Sarah Palin because there was so nothing on,
and that's ten minutes of my life I'd love to have
back.  </p>
<p>New Year's Day Delphine had a friend over, and the
next day we went skating!  I hadn't been skating since I
was a kid, and Delphine and Cordelia have never skated before.  Before
we went skating we went to the local skate shop and spent
$200 on skates, mainly for me.  I got some of these
new comfort skates.  <em>Comfort</em> skates!  They're purple!  Skating 
was very much
fun; I was surprised by how quickly I picked it back up
again.  I wasn't up to speed by any means, but I figured out
how to go forwards, how to go backwards, and how to stop.  Delphine 
got pretty good too, in an hour or so.  She isn't
quite skating properly but she can keep her balance.  Even
Cordelia did quite well, although when you're that short
and enshrouded in a snowsuit it's hardly catastrophic when
you fall over.  Kind of fun, actually.</p>
<p>That brings us to yesterday and today, which was a fairly
regular weekend.  I had taken the tree and decorations down
on Thursday and Friday, so the house is all back to normal
and tomorrow is just an ordinary Monday: Cordelia is back to
school, Delphine is back to school, I expect Blake will dig
back into work again and I will be back to my usual, busy,
slightly lonely and boring life.  Hmph, there's got to be
something to look forward to.  There's choir.  I have
a book club meeting on Friday.  Music class starts on
Saturday.  At some point in the future it will get warm again.
I guess it's not so bad.  I think I just have the Sunday 
blues.</p>
<p>But it was an awesome holiday!  I love Christmas.</p>

<p>Here is the last pile of books I read in 2008.  Since
it's now 2009 I can be reasonably sure I won't add
anything to this list.</p>
<h4>Non-Fiction</h4>
<p><strong><em>Restoration Home</em></strong> <strong>by Mark Bailey, Sally Bailey, and Debi Treloar</strong>
is an interesting decor porn book with a salvage bent.  These
people take shabby chic way beyond rumpled slipcovers and
distressed coffee tables.  They like chipped paint and missing
patches of plaster.  I liked the ideas about using industrial
light fixtures and other fittings, and about reusing found
objects.  I also like the aesthetic of not having everything
perfect and flawless.  Some of the examples in this book go
a little too far for my taste, though, into that crack-house
look.  To each their own.</p>
<p><strong><em>(parts of) Character is Destiny</em></strong> <strong>by John McCain and Mark Selter</strong>
This is a collection, written for a young adult audience, of short 
biographies of various historical figures
chosen by the authors to exemplify various character traits and
support their theory that "character is everything".  I 
picked it up partly because I had (previously) quite liked
and respected John McCain, and because there's a chapter on 
Roméo Dallaire, who I love.  I also ended up reading the 
chapters on Elizabeth I, Winston Churchill, Sojourner Truth,
and a couple others I forget now.  I learned a lot about
the people, which was the main point.  </p>
<p>This book made me wonder what
happened to John McCain that made him stray so far, during
the 2008 campaign, from the decent person he used to be.
I'm sure he's still decent, but something made him act all
crazy.  This probably ties into the fact that character is
indeed not everything and that how people behave is actually 
very strongly affected by the situation they are in (see
<em>The Lucifer Effect</em>.)</p>
<h4>Non-fiction books that are pretty good but that I don't have a lot to say about</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><em>Why Women Should Rule the World</em></strong> <strong>by DeeDee Myers</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>David Suzuki's</strong> <strong><em>Green Guide</em></strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Traffic</em></strong> <strong>by Tom Vanderbilt</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Mindfulness</em></strong> <strong>by Ellen Langer</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fiction</h4>
<p><strong><em>The Road</em></strong> <strong>by Cormac McCarthy</strong> was one of the best fiction
books I read this year, but in the same gruelling "I just want
this to end" way as <em>A Thousand Splendid Suns</em>.  I don't know 
what the connection is between gruelling and really good, but
if I ever come up with a happy and uplifting book which is
really good I will be sure to post about it.  This book hit a
few of my hot buttons: post-apocalyptic, small child, Viggo
Mortenson (okay, he's not in the book but I knew they cast
him for the movie version so that's what the protagonist
looked like in my head).</p>
<p><strong><em>Children of Men</em></strong> <strong>by P.D. James</strong> was really good.  I
didn't know P.D. James did speculative fiction.  This is 
another book I read instead of seeing the movie.</p>
<p><strong><em>What I Was</em></strong> <strong>by Meg Rosoff</strong> was a pretty decent young
adult book about a boy who is sent to a miserable boarding
school in Norwich (can there be any other kind?) and meets
a wild boy who lives on the beach.  They fall for each other
and hang out, there is some tragedy and a surprise ending.
Nice book.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Landing</em></strong> <strong>by John Ibbitson</strong> is yet another young
adult book, about a boy living in Muskoka in the twenties.  He 
plays violin but when you're poor in rural
Canada you're not going to get very far with that kind of
artsy nonsense.  Then he meets a woman who introduces him
to classical music and encourages him to pursue his playing.
Tragedy, rebirth, blah blah blah.  Actually a really good
book.</p>
<p><strong><em>Only You Can Save Mankind</em></strong> <strong>by Terry Pratchett</strong>; I mentioned
this earlier — I read it as a companion to <em>Ender's Game</em> and
like I said earlier, while I don't have as much meaty substance
as the other book it is funnier and equally well-written.</p>
<p><strong><em>Home for Christmas and other stories</em></strong> <strong>by Scott Young</strong> is
a collection of short stories, the old-fashioned kind with
a beginning, middle and end which don't
involve lots of weird allusions or great revelations or moments
of truth.  The kind of short stories that I and Michael Chabon
like.  They're all about Christmas, too.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Other Boleyn Girl</em></strong> <strong>by Phillipa Gregory</strong> is our
next book club book, and while it's not great literature it was
a good read, quite educational (assuming the historical
detail is accurate; I always wonder about that with historical
fiction) and will provide lots of things for us to talk about.</p>
<h4>Memoir</h4>
<p><strong><em>Schuyler's Monster</em></strong> <strong>by Rob Rummel-Hudson</strong>.  Well, the
cover of the book says "Robert Rummel-Hudson" but I've been
reading Rob's journal since Schuyler was just a baby, and
he's always been Rob.  It was cool to read Schuyler's
story in book form, and I liked that Rob kept his smart-assy
voice in the book.  I've always enjoyed Rob's writing and I
find it very hard to be impartial about the book because
I already liked it before I even read it.  I'm looking forward
to reading something of Rob's that I haven't read before.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Alchemy of Loss</em></strong> <strong>by Abigail Carter</strong> is a memoir
by a woman who lost her husband in the 9/11 attacks.  It's about
her grieving process and how she dealt with taking care of 
her two little kids, her family and husband's family, and with
her loss being part of a much bigger loss.  I picked this book
up because I have a fear of losing Blake, sparked in fact by 9/11,
and I wanted to read about how someone else had grieved and then
gone on with her life.  This book is beautifully written, very
honest, and hopeful.</p>
<h4>Parenting and Child Development</h4>
<p><strong><em>The Unschooled Mind</em></strong> <strong>by Howard Gardner</strong> is about how
kids learn about the world, and how educators really need
to take into account children's existing models of the world
when teaching them new things.  Apparently often what happens
is that kids learn two models of the world, the "real"
one and the "school" one.  The "real" model is the model
they kluged together through their observations back when
they were little kids, and the "school" model is techncially
correct but because they were never shown (not told) the errors
of their real-world model they only learn the school model 
by rote and never understand it well enough to take it out
into the real world.  So teachers have to know how to delicately
dismantle children's models — or rather help the children do it —
in order to make room for the new, subtler models.  Very interesting,
although Gardner is pretty dry.  More anecdotes please!</p>
<p><strong><em>The Homework Myth</em></strong> <strong>by Alfie Kohn</strong>.  I love Alfie Kohn.  He's
just so convincing.  In this book he convinced me that most
homework is a useless waste of time, which I'm sure will go over
really well with my kids' teachers.  Whatever, I'm not going to
squander my kids' precious free time doing busywork.  If the teachers
can come up with valuable interesting homework we'll do it.</p>
<p>Of course Delphine will do her homework anyway because she will
be too scared of getting in trouble not to do it.  Maybe Cordelia
will come onboard with my homework rebellion, though.</p>
<p><strong><em>How to Talk so Kids Will Listen And Listen so Kids Will Talk</em></strong> <strong>by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlich</strong>.  Everyone has said everything there is to be
said about this book.  If you deal with kids and you haven't read it
yet you'd better get on it.</p>
<p><strong><em>What to Look For In A Classroom and other essays</em></strong> <strong>by Alfie Kohn</strong>.
More Kohn cleverness.  He's an interesting and intelligent man.  This book
covers diverse topics in education, from standardized testing to the
subtle racism of middle-class mothers.  (Don't get me started on that
one.)  Great book.</p>

<p>It's the last day of 2008. To celebrate, Blake and
I are watching the last episode of the latest season of
<em>Canada's Worst Driver</em>, and hopefully going to bed
early.  Last night we stayed up too late and ended up
sleeping in, which made us late to go to the Art Gallery,
but more importantly made Blake hurry through his morning
routine and miss his cup of coffee, so I had to deal with
his bad mood all the way through the gallery.  It was
like dragging a recalcitrant donkey around.</p>
<p>But I digress.  This here is my New Year's Resolutions
post.  I meant to make one of these a year ago, but I
never got to it, which leads me to my first resolution:</p>
<p><strong>Blog more</strong>.  As you might have guessed from my
frantic book blogging of the last few days, I have a lot
more to say than I actually get around to saying.  Whether
that's a good thing or not is a matter of opinion, but
there's no point in having a blog if you don't post to
it.  Now that the girls are a little older, and now that
we have two computers (maybe three if we get the new 
router and the old Toshiba set up) I hope I can post at least
once at week.  That should allow me to, at least, keep on
top of the books.</p>
<p>I alluded to the necessity of my next resolution above:
<strong>try to sleep from 11 until 7</strong>.  I know, eight hours a 
night for a mother of two seems a little princessy, but
really the whole family is better off when I've had
my beauty sleep.  It also seems to me that I feel most
well-rested when I wake up at 7, and I have a pretty
good alert period in the late evening which I could
take advantage of if I stayed up until 11.  I read an article in
<em>New Scientist</em> a few years ago which said that everyone
has their own natural "time zone" (and so some people's
time zone doesn't fit into the 9-5 world, which gives
them a kind of societally-inflicted jet lag).  I think
11 to 7 works best for me — I'm just a little too cranky
when I wake up before 7.  Fortunately the girls sleep
that late most days.  </p>
<p>(This might be my last year of sleeping until 7 for a long
time, since next year Delphine starts Grade One and I'm
not sure if we can get out the door in time waking up at 7.)</p>
<p>Next, I'm going to try and schedule <strong>more playdates</strong> for
Delphine.  She's a really social little kid and I know 
she would love to play with her friends more — I know
I would have when I was her age.  The only reason 
she doesn't is that I don't get around to scheduling
playdates for her.  So I'm going to try harder and
get her out there (or someone over here) maybe once
a week or so.</p>
<p>This one is a bit embarrassing, but here it is.  I have
a problem keeping my cat's water clean.  I tend to 
fill it up and then leave it for days while it gets
gnarlier and gnarlier until Thomas is obliged to
drink the leftover water in the bathtub.  To be
sure, Thomas contributes by doing everything in 
his limited power to drown pieces of kibble in the
water bowl, and by inexplicably flicking the water
out of the bowl and mucking up the tray his water
lives in.  Anyway, I need to just suck it up and
<strong>pick up Thomas's gross water bowl every day and replace it
with a clean one</strong>.  How hard is that?</p>
<p>I need to <strong>talk to my mother more often</strong>.  Before my 
dad died I talked on the phone with my mother maybe
every couple of weeks, which isn't often enough.  I 
should talk to her every couple of days at least, just
to touch base and chit chat.  Part of the problem is that
I just don't make the time to call, and part of the
problem is that my mother is incapable of ten minute
phone calls; every call turns into a hour-long 
extravaganza.  However, maybe if I called every day
my Mum wouldn't feel the need to keep me on the phone
forever?  Anyway, I make stupid excuses, like
I have two little kids and I'm tired and I have other
stuff to do, but of course those excuses won't hold
much water when my Mum is gone too and I've missed
a thousand opportunities to talk to her.  That would
be stupid.</p>
<p>This is a gimme: I'm going to <strong>give up on
houseplants</strong>.  I just can't do it.  My house is too
dark and I never remember to water them at the right
time, and I just don't care that much.  I have enough
trouble keeping three people and a cat alive.  The
houseplants are toast.</p>
<p>I have a million books on hold at the library, but
 I have to <strong>catch up on my 
Neal Stephenson</strong>.  I read <em>Cryptonomicon</em> but I
haven't read any since then, and my geek cred is
severely suffering as a result.  I don't know if
I'm going to plough through <em>The Baroque Trilogy</em> or
just skip straight to the latest one.  We'll see.</p>

<p>I read <strong><em>The Greek for Love: A Memoir of Sorrow
and Joy</em></strong> <strong>by James Chatto</strong>  because
it was favourably reviewed in the <em>Globe</em>, and because
it's set (is it called "set" when it's non-fiction?)
in Corfu, a part of Greece I have some memoirish
familiarity with due to my obsessive childhood love of
Gerald Durrell.  I thought it would be interesting to
read a different, more modern perspective on the island.
Also this book is about someone losing a child.  Like
most parents I am consumed with fear that I will lose
(nice euphemism, as if I'm going to put them
down in a restaurant and forget to take them with me,
like a pair of gloves or an umbrella) one of my
children and my life will be destroyed.  I know 
I can't reasonably be assured that both my children
will survive me, but the matter of whether or not I can
go on with my life in the event of a tragedy is much
more in my control.  So I rather like to read about 
people surviving and carrying on after the death of
a child.</p>
<p>This book provided admirably on both counts; it's
an evocative sketch of Corfu in the seventies (? I think
it was the seventies): the weather, the landscape, the
crazy locals and the lovely ones.  It was also a 
beautifully written story of loss and how the author and his wife
dealt with it and moved through it.</p>
<p>So funny
story.  It was coming up to Blake's birthday and as 
usual I had no idea what to get him.  Mostly Blake
wants arcane pieces of electronic equipment that
usually cost a few hundred dollars.  So I buy him
socks and underwear, and chocolate-covered marzipan.
Well, he's a reader too so this year I went to the
local second-hand bookstore and stood gormlessly in
front of the SF/Fantasy section, apparently mistaking
him for my first boyfriend who would read pretty much
any SF or fantasy.  After a few moments I came to my
senses and remembered that if 80% of everything is
crap, 99% of genre fiction is crap and likely Blake
had already read the 1% of SF that isn't.  So I 
shuffled disconsolately around the store until I got
to the non-fiction section, which as you might guess
is my favourite place.  </p>
<p>Now the problem with buying
books for another reader, especially when your
interests overlap somewhat, is that it's hard to 
tell whether you have picked up a particular book
because you think the other person would enjoy it,
or because you want to get your own hands on it.  (We
actually have a convention in our family that it's
fine to read a book, carefully, before you give it 
to someone as a gift.)  So there I was standing in
front of the non-fiction books trying to figure out
what I could give to Blake that wouldn't be too transparently
something I wanted to read myself, when a peculiar
thought came to me:</p>
<p>"I wish Dave were here, he would know what to get."</p>
<p>Now why my brother, who lives on the other side of
the planet and who hasn't seen Blake for years, would
know better than I who spend every day with the man
what Blake would like to read I don't know, but just
then my eyes lit upon the Bill Bryson books and I
remembered that Dave had said something favourable
about Bryson recently in his blog.  I also remembered
that Blake had enjoyed another of his books, and so
for Blake's birthday I got him <strong><em>The Lost 
Continent: Travels in Small-Town America</em></strong> <strong>by Bill 
Bryson</strong>.    And then read 
it. Well, I let Blake read it first.  And it was
very good, and I enjoyed it.  Bill Bryson rocks, I 
should read more of his stuff.</p>
<p>Incidentally Blake really liked it too — I had
forgotten that Bryson also wrote <em>The Mother
Tongue</em>, a book Blake really enjoys.  So apparently
Dave actually <em>is</em> the go-to guy when I need a gift
idea for my own husband.  This is what happens
when you marry your brother.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dreams from my Father: A Story of Race and 
Inheritance</em></strong> <strong>by Barack Obama</strong> came
to me in a package from my mother, who had received it
in turn from my brother.  I believe Dave either got it
from a friend or lent it to a friend before sending it
to Mum, so our copy has been read by four people
on two continents.  Right now it's stuck on our bookshelf
because Blake wants to read it but hasn't gotten to
it.  If anyone reading this would like it let me know
and I will send it on, because it's a fantastic book.
(Blake can get it from the library if he really wants
to read it.)</p>
<p>A while ago I posted about why I was happy that Obama
won the election, and a large part of that post was
informed by what I know about the man from this book.
It's wonderfully well-written and Obama is clearly a
very intelligent person who isn't satisfied with 
just seeing the surfaces of things or with simple
explanations.  This book is about identity and
personal history and I found it particularly interesting
because I related to issues of constructing identity
from family, of being an immigrant, and of having a
mobile, unsettled childhood.  It was a wonderful
read and I am looking forward to reading 
<em>The Audacity of Hope</em>, and anything else
Obama has the time to write.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Long Way Down: An Epic Journey by Motorcycle from 
Scotland to South Africa</em></strong> <strong>by Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman</strong>
is the companion book to the reality series of the
same name, about McGregor and Boorman's motorcycle
ride from John O'Groats to Cape Town.  Good book, pretty
much like <em>Long Way Round</em> which I read in 2006.
I liked reading a new perspective on Africa.</p>
<p>Morgan secured her nomination for Sister-in-law Of
The Year when she gave me <strong><em>Slash</em></strong> <strong>by Slash and
Anthony Bozza</strong> for my birthday.  (And now that I
think of it, she borrowed it as soon as I finished it.
I guess my new family is more like my old family than
I sometimes realize.)  I loved this book.  This is
going to sound odd, but it gave me new insight into
the roots of the Guns N' Roses sound.  When I started
listening to them in 1988 or 89 I was basically coming
to rock music cold, with a listening history of almost
exclusively pop music.  I've gained a clue or two since
then but never re-examined GN'R, just maintained my
uncomplicated love for their music.  So it was very 
interesting to put that music into the context of the
glam and punk scenes it was born from, scenes I
didn't have Clue One about back when I was a pimply
Good Girl teenager in northern Saskatchewan.  </p>
<p>This book also gave me a more subtle appreciation for
the contributions of the non Slash/Axl members of
the band, who I had previously largely disregarded.  Especially
Steve Adler; I used to think he was pretty much an
interchangable Lego-piece drummer, but Slash convinced
me that his casually hyper rock style contributed significantly
to the sound of <em>Appetite for Destruction</em>.</p>
<p>This book also made me appreciate just how much crap
you can throw at a human body and have it 
survive.  Well, more or less survive, if you have a pacemaker
anyway.  Slash had a weird, undisciplined childhood and a
crazy life but he is grounded and disciplined and
seems like a decent (in the "honest" sense if not
the "proper" sense) guy. Fun book.</p>
<p>I took out <strong><em>The Vanished Landscape</em></strong> <strong>by Paul Johnson</strong>
because I was looking for books about Staffordshire, where
my mother is from.  The subtitle of the book is 
"A 1930s Childhood in the Potteries", which is exactly
what my mother had.  Funnily enough, my mother's childhood
and Johnson's couldn't have been more different.  Johnson
is the child of middle-class parents, his father an art teacher 
and his mother
one of those women who does nice things for poor people.
They moved from Manchester to Stoke when Johnson spent
his early childhood.  </p>
<p>My mother, on the other hand, is
the child of working class parents and she grew up in
a small town near Stoke, one of those pastoral Shire-like
English towns, with hedgerows and sheep and little walls made of
stones.  The little towns that 
no longer exist because they've turned
into exurbs of nearby cities.  Anyway, Johnson is
a beautiful writer and describes Stoke wonderfully,
especially the "vanished landscape" of the title, the
old potbanks and wastelands born of the pottery
industry.  His father taught him to see the
Burtynsky-esque beauty in that kind of landscape.
I also loved Johnson's descriptions of his family and
other people, and his stories of a much more
unfettered childhood than today's children are allowed.</p>
<p>My mother read this book, too, and it got her blood boiling
because Johnson is an old-school English snob, going on
about how the poor people (that's my Mum) are all dirty
and ignorant and need charity.  As it turns out Johnson
(who I had never heard of before) came to America and 
was an advisor for the Republican party.  No surprise
there.  </p>
<p>I will probably read more Johnson because I love how he
writes, but I wish there were more memoirs of Staffordshire
out there.  Like Barack Obama, I am continually 
searching for my identity through my family history.</p>
