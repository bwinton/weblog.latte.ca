<p>Kat has inspired me to get my running shoes back on; she is
training for an as-yet-unspecified 5K, so we're going to 
egg each other on.  She runs on the treadmill at her condo
and I like to run outside (because I don't have a treadmill
and I'm too poor to join a gym, and because running on
a treadmill is boring) so we probably won't actually 
run together until spring.  But we'll talk about running!</p>
<p>We talked about running last night before choir, and as Kat
wisely pointed out, if you want to do something you should
do it as soon as possible after you've determined to do it,
so I ran this afternoon after I dropped Delphine off at
school.  Since Blake is "working" from "home", he can 
make sure Cordelia doesn't catch fire or something 
while she's napping, and so I can leave the house in the 
afternoon.  Plus it was sunny and warm (only -5!) - too
good to pass up.</p>
<p>I did 3K in 1-and-1s.  1-and-1s is pretty lame, but I
haven't been out for a long time, and it's cold and 
when I run in the cold my lungs get wheezy and I get 
that coppery taste in my mouth, so
I thought I would go easy on myself.  And it was a
pretty easy run.  There were times
when the one minute of running seemed too short, and
only one time when I was really glad of the break, so
next time I will do 2-and-1s.  </p>
<p>My plan is to run three times a week, on Tuesdays,
Thursdays and the weekend.  I'll do 3K for the next two
runs and then up the distance a little bit and also
increase intensity to 3-and-1s.  I just hope it doesn't
stay so cold for weeks and weeks.  I don't know if I
can motivate myself to run when it's horribly cold.</p>
<p>I went for a couple of runs over the winter, before
it got so cold.  I tried something new: listening to
music instead of timing my intervals.  (I have to
choose because I time intervals by the beeping of
my watch and if I'm listening to music I can't hear
the beeps.  I'm sure there is some technological 
solution to this problem.)  Listening to music is
fun, but I missed the satisfaction of being able 
to measure and manage the ratio of running to walking.
(I'm a geek.)  Plus it's kind of nice to have time
to just let the thoughts roll through my head.  Apparently
that kind of unstructured daydreaming time is <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026811.500-the-secret-life-of-the-brain.html">very
important</a>.  So I'm going to stick with timing
intervals.</p>
<p>And now I should go stretch.</p>

<p>Delphine and I were walking to a playdate a few weeks
ago.  As we walked she asked me about the names of the
streets we were on, and which way they all go.  I
said, maybe sometime we can make a map of the neighbourhood.
"Maybe," I said, "you could do it at your playdate, and
your friend's mother could help."</p>
<p>"That would be fun." said Delphine, "But my friend will
only want to play fairies!"</p>
<p>Then she paused and said, "No-one ever wants to do what
I want to do."  (She is prone to these gloomy 
generalizations.)  "None of my friends like what
I like."</p>
<p>I explained to her that she has only met thirty people her
age at school, plus a handful more at daycare and around.
I said as she goes through school she'll meet more people and
maybe one day she we meet someone who wants to make maps
instead of playing with fairies.  Sooner or later we
all find our people.</p>

<p>Our house is pretty chilly in winter, and it's quite clear
that one of the weak links is the windows.  You can tell 
from the avalanche of freezing cold air that rolls off the
windows as soon as you open the blinds*.  So this winter
we decided to try that plastic wrap stuff that you tape
around the windows and then blowdry to tighten it up and 
make it all smooth.  It's kind of ghetto but we can't afford
to replace the windows, so it will have to do, and I was
determined to do it right -- there is a house nearby 
with plastic on the windows and they didn't prep it properly
so the tape has come off and it's hanging down and it 
looks <em>really</em> ghetto.</p>
<p>There were two brands at the store, 3M and another brand
from Quebec.  This whole post would be much more useful if
I remembered what the brand of the other stuff was; anyway,
it comes in a blue box and it's from Quebec.  We bought
the two-window kit by 3M and the five-window kit from the 
other company; both kits were about $35, so you can see that
the 3M stuff would have to be much better to be worth the
extra money.</p>
<p>Here were the differences between the two products:</p>
<ul>
<li>the 3M stuff had slightly wider double-sided tape, and 
the tape backing had red text printed on it - that doesn't seem
like a big thing but our window frames are white so the white-only
backing on the other tape made it a little harder to find the
end of the tape.  3M advertise that "the difference is in the 
tape", and indeed that's one of the things they are known for,
but apart from the slight difference in width and the backing,
I couldn't perceive a difference in the tape.  Maybe the
other brand will start peeling off in February or something.</li>
<li>the instructions on the other stuff were more thorough.  At
first Blake interpreted that to mean that the other stuff was
harder to install, but installation was identical for the
two products, it's just that 3M tried to make it sound easy.</li>
<li>the non-3M film was thinner.  I suppose that would make it
more fragile but I didn't have trouble with it breaking, and
it heat-shrunk better.  I doubt the width of the film makes
much difference to insulation; I expect insulation is mainly
furnished by the air between the window and the film.</li>
</ul>
<p>So this is what you do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clean the window frame.  I used a solution of water, dish soap
and vinegar, and a cloth diaper.  (I cleaned the window too
because I'm not going to get at it for a few months.)
Then I wiped it with rubbing alcohol - that's what the
non-3M stuff said to do.</li>
<li>Put the tape on the window frame.  After the first couple
of pieces I figured out that you need to peel a couple of
inches off the backing paper before you put the tape up because
it's really hard to start it when it's up on your window.</li>
<li>Cut the plastic film to size.  We ended up with lots of 
extra film, but I'm not sure how much extra they give you.
Our windows might just be small.  Anyway, give yourself three
or four extra inches on each side just to be safe.</li>
<li>Peel the backing paper off the tape.  This is kind of fun.</li>
<li>Adhere the film to the tape.  You can actually stick it on 
fairly gently to start with, and then pull it off, stretch
it and restick it until you have it as tight and smooth
as possible.  Then press it firmly onto the tape once you're
happy with it.</li>
<li>This is the fun part: use a blow dryer to heat the plastic
so it shrinks like a giant shrinkydink and pulls all the
remaining wrinkles out.</li>
<li>Trim the excess film.  Carefully.  I was very conservative
and left lots of extra because I didn't want to risk puncturing
the film.  Your mileage may vary.</li>
<li>Stand back and admire your work.  I'm really happy with how
ours turned out; you can't see it at all from outside, and it's
barely noticable from inside.</li>
</ol>
<p>It took me about half an hour for each window, and I did it over
a week or so.  Kind of a big production and pain in the ass.
I think it's helping with the cold thing though.  Our big problem
(apart from the aforementioned avalanche of cold) was condensation,
and there's much less of it now, so clearly that cold is being
stopped.  I'm not sure if it's going to save us $70 in utility  bills, 
though.  But we'll probably do it again next year just for
the increased comfort.</p>
<p>Anyway, so that's what I learned about insulating window film.
Hopefully this is helpful to someone somewhere.</p>
<p>* Incidentally our blinds are awesome.  We have honeycomb blinds
from Hunter Douglas and they block a heck of a lot of cold.  We
saved a bunch on natural gas after we installed them, which is
good because they were about a million dollars.  I expect another
brand of the same product would be equally effective, but
the Hunter Douglas ones are very well made.  I'm happy with them.
(I wish we had got the top-down/bottom-up mechanism on all the
blinds, though; the only window we didn't get it for was the
living room, and sometimes I would like to open just the top
of that, like in the morning in summer when I'm not dressed yet.)</p>

<p>I mentioned briefly in my last post that Blake and I have
started watching a show called <em>Being Erica</em>.  It's about
a 32-year-old Toronto woman who gets a chance to travel
back in time and revisit some bad decisions from her past.
We're really enjoying it;  the characterization is
good, the scripts are funny, the music is AWESOME, and 
of course it's perfectly our age group so everything is
sometimes painfully close to home.  And it's SO Toronto
and so Canadian: lots of location shots, Molson Canadian,
sex in a canoe.</p>
<p>So Blake said, "I should totally tell Morgan to watch this,
with the graduating in '94 and the trips to Muskoka."  And
I said, "Yeah, I want to tell Kat about it, too."  Kat and
Morgan and I are all '75ers, and I think Kat would really
enjoy this show and relate, too.</p>
<p>And finally I wonder if my New York friends Sascha and Leontine
would like it -- they love Canada and Toronto so maybe
they'd get a kick out of it, if they have time to watch
TV.</p>
<p>Anyway (I think) all those people read this blog, so 
consider yourselves notified.  (Kat, we have them downloaded
if you want to watch them here.)</p>

<h4>Part III: Me</h4>
<p>Seems like even though this is my blog (well, half mine)
I don't post about myself very much.  I post about the kids,
I post about what I read, I even post about my husband
sometimes, but I don't post about what's going on with
me.  Lucky for you, but today your luck has run out: this
post is all about me.</p>
<p>It's still January, and January is still kicking my ass.
I've been so tired and so disinclined to do anything since
the Christmas decorations came down.  I haven't vacuumed, I
haven't tidied; I am just barely getting through the absolute
necessities.  I read awhile ago that when you get depressed
there's actually some kind of blockage in the system which
takes messages from your brain to your muscles, so you lie
there thinking, "I'm going to get up and pick up all that
Lego" and... nothing happens.  That's how I feel.  Plus,
as discussed earlier, it's so bloody cold.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a little breakdown because there's crap
all over the downstairs: dolls, stuffed animals, books, 
random miniature backpacks, board games, the usual
detritus of small children.  Since I have been more 
disinclined than usual to tidy up, this stuff has been
accumulating in the corners and nooks like giant, 
brightly coloured dust bunnies, and it finally tipped me
over the edge yesterday.  Blake's solution was: "Get the
girls to tidy up."  Bwah hah hah, yes, I'll get right
on that.  I'm sure that will be much easier than doing
it myself.  Then he got mad at me for being sarcastic.
So we had a big fight.  Le sigh.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Cordelia is still
too small to really understand how to tidy up, so if I 
want to continue to allow her to <em>own</em> and <em>play with</em> stuff,
I need to pick up after her.  Normally I'm okay with
doing that, but see above re: January.  Not only do
I lack the energy to clean up but I'm more emotionally
fragile than usual so the mess bugs me more.  Double-whammy,
POW, BIFF!</p>
<p>Whatever.  Out of the dust a phoenix rises, or at least a
good idea: we're going to get each girl a giant bucket
(I like <a href="http://www.tubtrugs.com/tubtrugs.html">these</a>)
and every day before dinner everyone has to load their 
shit, er I mean their prized possessions into their bucket
and take it upstairs.  Once there, Delphine can do whatever she
wants with her stuff and I will help Cordelia put hers
away in her room.  Result!  Hopefully.</p>
<p>Anyway, so that was my large digression regarding the
state of the house as it pertains to my state of mind, which
is not great right now but I'm sure will improve as the
days get longer and the snow melts.</p>
<p>Apart from the usual Mum stuff of cooking, cleaning, 
reading out loud, playing and taking people places, mainly
I spend my time reading and watching TV.  In addition to
the books I read, I also get through most of the Saturday
<em>Globe and Mail</em>, (excepting the Sports, Report on Business
and Travel sections which I recycle first off).  I also get
<em>New Scientist</em> every week (well, it's supposed to be weekly;
it seems to come in spurts), and <em>Today's Parent</em> every
month.  I used to get <em>Canadian House and Home</em> but I don't
have the money to decorate or renovate so it just depressed 
me.</p>
<p>We cancelled cable a while ago and now we download all our
TV, which is working really well.  I'm pretty happy with
the stuff we watch; life is short and there are lots of books
to read, so I try and only watch shows I really like.  I just
dumped <em>90210</em> because it wasn't good enough to squander precious
hours of my life on.  That doesn't seem to set a really high
bar, does it?  This is what I do watch: <em>The Daily Show</em>, 
<em>Chuck</em>, <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, <em>Dirty Jobs</em>, <em>Mythbusters</em>
(mainly because Blake watches it), <em>Doctor Who</em>, and 
<em>Torchwood</em>.  We also just started watching a show called <em>Being
Erica</em> which looks like it's going to be pretty good.</p>
<p>Extra-curricular activities are limited by time and the
goodwill of the various people willing to look after my
children so I can leave the house.  I have choir practice
once a week from September to May.  Every month or two my
book club meets for dinner on Friday night in a restaurant.  (Ooh!
A restaurant!  Shiny!)
Every month I go to the school Parents Association so I can
stay in the loop with all the juicy school gossip.  That's
about it, I think.  Housebound much?</p>
<hr>
<p>So here's an interesting thing.  (Interesting if you're me.)
When I graduated from high school I was the most boring,
unmotivated, uninterested, extrinsically motivated person
imaginable.  I didn't know what I was interested in because
I wasn't interested in anything -- the only thing that
motivated me was pleasing other people, and other people
don't have the first clue what's right for me -- so off 
I went to university
and did Math for some very bad reasons, none of which had
anything to do with genuine interest.  But I forged through.
(And now that I think about it was pretty damn good to get
a degree in Math from a such a hard school when I wasn't
the slightest bit interested in it.)  Anyway, so I got the
degree and I worked in computers and every day was horrible
because I just didn't care.</p>
<p>The last five years, since I haven't been working and since
I have been reading, have been like an Independent Study.  I've 
been free to read whatever I want and explore my own
interests. If I don't want to read something, I don't have
to.  If I do want to, I can, and then if that book leads me
to one or two or three other books I can read them, too.  (Funny 
thing: in all that time I don't think I've read a
single book about math.)</p>
<p>So oddly enough, being a stay-at-home mom has been a
very rich time for me, intellectually.  I've exposed myself
to lots of ideas, lots of novels, lots and lots of facts.
And the more I read and the smarter I get, the more I know that
I must change careers and that I need to spend some time
and effort figuring out what's right for me.  Fortunately
I have read plenty of books about finding happiness and satisfaction
in life, so I can use them for guidance.  But more on that
later.  That's a whole 'nother set of posts and I
still have lots and lots of thinking to do.  (For some reason
I have time to read but not time to think.)  Stay tuned.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now it's time for bed - tomorrow is Thursday, and it's going to
be warm so we might go play outside.  Apparently Delphine told
Blake she didn't want Mummy to be crabby any more, so he wants
me to figure out what I need to feel better.  I thought about it
a little bit and I think I need some time to myself, to get
away from everyone's needs.  I don't get a lot of that, and
usually I can deal but, well, January.  So I'm going
to take some Me Time tomorrow afternoon and go window shopping
on Bayview while Delphine is at school.  Delphine has French
after school, then home for supper and then I might
go downtown and see if I can get a good deal on 
a winter coat.  Dunno -- maybe I shouldn't blow all my Me time
on one day.  Or maybe I should!</p>

<h4>Part II: Blake</h4>
<p>There's something slightly weird about me posting about
the other writer of this shared blog, but whatever.  This
is the wifely perspective on Blake's life.  </p>
<p>So Blake is in some kind of between-job limbo, fortunately
punctuated by contract work which we assume will be lucrative
once he gets paid.  There's a vague job offer in the offing
but nothing has been signed yet.  Limbo indeed.</p>
<p>The working from home is going pretty well, I think.
We don't have a home office, per se, in that our house
has six rooms (three bedrooms, bathroom, kitchen and 
living/dining) so he's set up in the bedroom, on 
Baba's antique sewing machine.  It's a pretty sad
 state of affairs and it wouldn't work in the long
term, but it will do for now.  He also takes breaks
in the living room, and sometimes gets out of the house
and works at U of T (where he Knows People) or Starbucks
(where he Spends Money).</p>
<p>Apart from the working he spends what seems to be
a lot of time on his own programming projects and on
open source projects.  (I say "what seems to be" because
for all I know he was spending the same amount of
time on that stuff when he was at the office and I
just didn't see it).  He also reads lots of books (but
not as many as me because he's not insane) and listens
to a lot of podcasts.  A huge number of podcasts.  Mostly
really geeky ones about programming languages, comics and
role-playing games.</p>
<p>Despite Blake being laid off in these Trying Times, we're pretty
optimistic.  Our spending habits are pretty sensible, and
the future looks bright.  And like Blake says, we have a lot
of available credit.  Hah.</p>

<h4>Part I: Our Routine</h4>
<p>It's the middle of January, and January sucks.  It goes on and
on forever and ever, and it's bloody fracking cold this year.
I mean really cold, and I'm tired of it.  I know it gets cold and
it snows every year - this is Canada - but I hate it.  I hate the
bundling up and the having to hurry everywhere outside, but 
mostly I hate the sheer discomfort of being cold.  I am a big
baby.</p>
<p>The girls and I are still doing what I like to call 
<em>Der grosse Schlep</em> on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  We take
Cordelia to school for nine, pick her up at 11:30, have lunch
and then take Delphine to school for 12:40.  When Delphine is
at school Cordelia takes a nap, and then we pick Delphine
up at 3:20.  This massive to-ing and fro-ing was supposed to
be a little easier this year because Baba and Zaida bought
a condo halfway between Delphine's school and Cordelia's,
which was to be our waystation and lunch room.  However, the
condo is still (still!) not finished.  I am hoping it will
be done before the end of the school year, but my breath is
not held.</p>
<p>On the other hand Blake's quasi-employed status is proving to
be very helpful.  I can leave Delphine at home while I take
Cordelia to school, and pick her up, and after lunch he puts
Cordelia down for her nap while I take Delphine to school.
This makes for much less putting on and taking off of snowsuits,
and of course I can travel much faster alone.  Hopefully by
the time he gets back to work, snowsuit season will be over.</p>
<p>Apart from the main schedule, which revolves around school,
we have some other stuff going on too.  In the fall both 
girls had gymnastics, and now we're in Music Together on
Saturday mornings.  (In order to keep our schedule manageable
we do an annual rotation of activities: gymnastics in the 
fall, music in winter, swimming in spring.)  Delphine also
has Sparks on Wednesday evenings at 5:30, which let me say
is an insanely bad time for an activity.  We have to leave at
5:15 and we're not home until 6:45, which (when bedtime is
at 7:00 is far too late for dinner.)</p>
<p>The other regular rhythm to our life is that after school
the girls watch two (2) TV shows.  I was pretty hardline on the
TV thing for a long time, but an essay in that Alfie Kohn
book convinced me that TV isn't inherently evil, and 
Delphine's getting to the age where TV is a significant
part of her peer culture.  And Blake and I watch and 
enjoy our TV shows - I try not to be too much of a hypocrite.</p>
<p>That's our routine these days.  It's going to be like this
until the end of the school year, and then next year life
will be significantly easier because Cordelia will be
in JK at the same school as Delphine.  Hooray!</p>

<p><strong><em>Village Life in England, 1860-1940: A Photographic Record</em></strong> <strong>by 
Johnathan Brown and Sadie B. Ward</strong> is a collection of early
photographs of life in rural England.  The book includes hundreds of pictures
accompanied by descriptions, and divided into categories:
school, work, domestic matters...  It was just there on the shelf, 
it looked neat so I picked it up.  Lots of interesting pictures,
if you like this sort of thing, and the text taught me a lot about
the fate of village life as more and more people moved to the
cities: basically the villages became either bedroom communities,
or theme parks for town folk looking to get away on the weekend.
  My favourite picture was the one of two village lads wearing 
their work clothes, with their sleeves
too short, tiny pockets up high on their waistcoats, exactly like
the hobbit costumes in <em>Lord of the Rings</em>.  (I guess those costume
people know what they're doing.)  </p>
<p><strong><em>You Know What They Say: The Truth About Popular Beliefs</em></strong> <strong>by 
Alfie Kohn</strong>.  Debunking and Alfie Kohn, two of my favourite things 
together in the same book!  Kohn takes on dozens of common misbeliefs
and aphorisms: do birds of a feather flock together or do opposites
attract?  Is it never to late to learn, or can you not in fact teach
an old dog new tricks?  Are no two snowflakes alike?</p>
<p>The book is pretty old, which means on the one hand it hasn't worked
because most people still believe the stuff he tries to clear up,
and on the other hand a couple of the beliefs he discusses have
been further researched and the latest research actually supports
the belief.  Specifically, there has been more research on whether
being cold causes you to catch cold, and it seems that being cold,
or at least having cold feet, can <a href="http://www.edwardwillett.com/Columns/oldwivescolds.htm">increase your susceptibility to
cold viruses</a>.
That's the great thing about science, you never know what's gonna
be true tomorrow.</p>
<p>A couple of the chapters I just didn't believe, like the one
about PMS which scientists apparently don't (or didn't) have
any evidence for.  I'm pretty sure the misery I feel before
my period comes is materially different from the misery I
feel the rest of the month.  It's the difference between
soul crushing depression and, say, the disappointment I
feel when they're out of sour cream glazed at Timmy's.  It 
just feels different.  Hopefully they've done some better
research since the book was published, but I expect the
pharma companies just decided to declare PMS an official
disease so they could sell us crap to cure it.</p>
<p>That apart, I really enjoyed reading the book, because I 
love to get the story straight on everything, and also 
because I like Alfie Kohn so
very much.  He's smart, he's funny, he's a skeptic and a thinker
and a humanist.  I might even send him some fan mail, I like him so much.</p>
<p>Oh, and I think it's kind of funny that two of the popular beliefs
were "Rewarding people makes them do better work" and "Competition
builds character", both of which he then expanded into entire books of 
their own.</p>
