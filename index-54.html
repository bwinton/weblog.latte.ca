<p>My kids are great. They really are, despite occasional outbursts
to the contrary. Okay - here's what they do that's annoying: Cordelia
dawdles in the morning when it's time to get dressed; Delphine
whines when I ask her to clean up (or leave the playground, or 
stop doing whatever she is enjoying); while they do play nicely
together, they are both often impatient with each other and often
fight, usually about really stupid things.  That's all!  That's
not much, really.</p>
<p>Okay, there's one more thing.  The most annoying annoyance is 
the pestering: they pester me
for television, and for candy, and for trips to the park.  They
pester me to let them paint, or go play across the street.  They
ask, I say no, (or later, or tomorrow, or "you already had your
tv/candy for today"), and then they beg. They argue. They bargain.
They whine.  Sometimes they win, sometimes they lose, sometimes
they get distracted by something else, but however it ends it's
tedious and aggravating.</p>
<p>I don't control what they eat at mealtimes, I don't control
what they wear, I don't control what they play with, so they
don't pester me about that stuff.  The things which they pester 
me for are the things which I control; the things for which 
I'm the gatekeeper. </p>
<p>It must be so frustrating for them, to want something and to
have to get past me in order to get it. I really can't blame
them for pestering. I know if I wanted a lollipop or to watch
<em>Chuck</em> or something and someone was (apparently) arbitrarily 
preventing me from doing so, I would be pretty pissed off. 
I would do everything in my power to get what I wanted, even
if the only thing in my power was whining. Indeed, the very
fact that I couldn't have that lollipop would probably make
me much more obsessed with it than I would be if I could just
grab a lollipop whenever I wanted one.</p>
<p>I've tried to create some kind of external structure around
these things, so that it's not up to my whim. For example, 
the girls are allowed two TV shows
a day, and four a day on weekends. These are rules they helped
create and which they agreed to. Even so, they manage to
find all kinds of opportunities for negotiation: TV now or
later? Which shows? How long are they? Does Pingu count
as one show? No? How many Pingus count as a show? Ultimately
all these decisions <em>are</em> up to me, which puts all the power
in my hands and creates a very unpleasant dynamic where they
are constantly supplicating to me and I'm in control of their
happiness. This is not how I want my home to be.</p>
<p>So what to do? I guess we could come up with ever more specific
rules: TV only after school; three Pingus equals one Dora; one
Sesame Street equals two Doras; if Delphine watches something
while Cordelia is napping then Cordelia gets to pick the
next show... Augh. That way lies madness, and eight million
rules.</p>
<p>The assumption underlying all this, of course, is that if I
left these decisions: how much TV? How much candy?; in the 
hands of the kids, they would handle it badly. Is this assumption
valid? If I let them watch as much TV as they wanted, would
they watch it all the time? To the exclusion of doing other
things? What about candy? If there were candy available all
the time would they eat too much of it?</p>
<p>I can start to answer these questions by considering 
adult behaviour. (That's the logical extension of every parenting
dilemma, isn't it? "He's not going to be in diapers when he
goes to university."  "She's not going to keep eating only
white food for the rest of her life.") So, I know I have
gone through periods when I watched too much TV. I know I
have watched TV, even crap TV, to the exclusion of 
other, more valuable activities. There are plenty of people
out there who inarguably watch too much TV, for whom TV has
negatively affected their quality of life and prevented them
from living up to their potential.  It has taken a good deal
of self-restraint (and some technological tricks) to reduce
my TV watching to the level it's at now, and even still I
could probably afford to watch less.  I have to consciously
manage my TV habit; perhaps it is asking too much for a five-year-old
and a three-year-old to do the same, and it <em>is</em> appropriate
for me to manage it for them.  Perhaps I have to just suck
it up and deal with their whining as a part of being a
parent.</p>
<p>(I could write that whole paragraph over again for candy,
as I'm sure you can imagine.)</p>
<p>Incidentally, I'm thinking
of shutting off the TV altogether this summer.  (Well, at least
for the kids. I'm a giant hypocrite. Also there's no way Blake
would agree to not watching TV.) I have a friend whose
dad unplugged the TV every summer and I must say it sounds like
a fine idea. At least it will provide me with a short and easy
answer to any demands: "Sorry kids, no TV until school starts in
September." It might even curb the whining. Maybe.</p>
<p>I don't know the solution to this problem. Maybe I need to keep
explaining the importance of not watching too much
TV. Maybe I need to be more firm when they try and negotiate (I
think I'm pretty good at sticking to our existing rules but perhaps
I could be better.) Maybe I've been blessed with particularly
persistent children and I just need to be more patient. Maybe
I need to try harder to distract them.  Maybe I'll just keep trying
things until something works. Or they move out and buy their own
damn TV.</p>

<p>Here's a letter I sent to President's Choice Financial 
Mastercard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a PC Financial Mastercard and I'm very happy with 
it. However, I just ordered a set of convenience cheques 
and I was dismayed to see that you included a plastic 
chequebook holder. The environment is a major concern of 
mine and I don't believe it's necessary to include a 
plastic checkbook holder every time a client orders ten 
cheques. Ironically, the cheques came with a note telling 
me how environmentally friendly they are.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, I called the customer support 
number and the person I spoke to there ("Kevin") laughed 
at me when I expressed this concern. He said he would 
"put a note in my file". I asked if anyone would see 
it, and he replied that "someone might see it and have 
a chuckle". Perhaps he doesn't understand the gravity of 
climate change? Perhaps he doesn't care. But surely 
there is a better way to deal with a client's concerns 
than putting a note in their file so someone can 
stumble across it and have a chuckle.</p>
<p>Thanks for your attention to this matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, I read the fine print on the "convenience
cheques" and realized what a bum deal they are, so I'm 
going to go back to regular cheques anyway.</p>

<p>This just happened.  Delphine and Cordelia have been
fighting all day, apart from some nice long breaks for
<em>Sesame Street</em> and <em>Dora</em>. Finally the television
ends and after some brief spats Cordelia settles down
on the couch looking at a book, and Delphine comes to
the dining table to colour.</p>
<p>After not three minutes of peace, Delphine says, out
of the blue, with no provocation whatsoever, "You've
been looking at that book for a long time, Cordelia!"</p>
<p>So I said, "She must find it very interesting." Trying
to pretend we're all normal human beings who don't pick
at each other for the sheer joy of it.</p>
<p>Delphine: "It seems boring to me!"</p>
<p>Yet more fighting ensues. Why?  Why?! They were doing fine
and then Delphine out and out picked a fight! I swear
sometimes I feel like wringing their little fucking 
necks.</p>
<hr>
<p>Delphine just came over to show me the picture she
coloured in for me, with fish and a little pink bird.
She's sweet. Her little neck is safe.</p>

<p><strong><em>British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of 
History</em></strong> <strong>by Colin Spencer</strong>. Yes, I know what you're 
thinking because every damn person who saw this book on
my shelf had some stupid joke about English food. But
guess what? English food was really cool and interesting
until, I dunno, the Reformation or something. The reason
that I only know about the cool and interesting part, and
not how it ended, is that this book, while packed with
information, was a bit dry, and in the end I gave up on it.  </p>
<p>If you want or need to know what the British ate, and why,
(and how they got it, prepared it and served it) this is
the book for you, but if you're looking for a juicy read
I would hold out for <em>Eating for England</em> by Nigel Slater, 
which I will write up as soon as I read it.</p>
<p>Between <em>Ishmael</em> and <em>British Food</em>, that was two books in
a row I abandoned, making me doubt my ability to, I dunno,
read, so I lobbed myself a nice easy ball with <strong><em>Howl's 
Moving Castle</em></strong> <strong>by Diana Wynne Jones</strong>. My brother 
recommended Diana Wynne Jones, and you know I have this
thing about reading books instead of watching movies
that are based on them, so this was a shoo-in. And it
was a lovely read, light and refreshing and escapist, like
a grapefruit sorbet. Nice characters, good story, very
satisfying. We'll probably get the movie for the girls
sometime.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Schools Our Children Deserve: Moving Beyond 
Traditional Classrooms and "Tougher Standards"</em></strong> 
<strong>by Alfie Kohn</strong>. I continue my romp through the 
Alfie Kohn canon with a book which makes me think that
Cordelia is currently experiencing the high point of
her education. This is a book about how education ought
to be, with Kohn's usual rigorous research and wry, 
readable style. </p>
<p>I'm glad I read it because I think it's
important to know how things are when they're at their
best, but I think it will cause me some grief to realize
how far the TDSB is from the ideal.  Although we're a
damn sight closer than some of the lunatic school boards
in America! Someone on Twitter posted about her kindergartener
failing the entrance test for a gifted public school.
Kindergartener, entrance test, and gifted public school
are words that should never appear in the same sentence.
(Except that one.)  In fact the phrase "gifted public
school" shouldn't exist all by itself. But anyway.
If you have a kid in school, you should read this. If you're
a teacher, you should read this. I think that pretty 
much covers everyone who reads this blog, some people
twice.</p>
<p>Also I think it might be the only book I've ever read
with scare quotes in the title.</p>
<p><strong><em>How to Make a Garden: The 7 Essential Steps for the 
Canadian Gardener</em></strong> <strong>by Marjorie Harris</strong>. If there's
any Canadian gardener who needs essential steps, it's
me.  I have 60 by 20 feet of garden (that's just the
backyard) which I have been staring vacantly at for two years
now, and I have yet to pluck up the courage to do anything
more major than pluck a few weeds and plant a few bulbs.
Fortunately Marjorie Harris knows what to do, and further 
she knows how to tell me how to figure out what to do
for myself. This book is incredibly packed with information:
how to design your garden, prepare and care for your soil,
how to choose plants, how to plant them and how to care for
them once they're planted.  It's larded with lots
of great plant recommendations, and it closes with a
description of what tasks you should do in your garden in
each season. I <em>need</em> to own this book.</p>

<p>...although she doesn't like the idea. On Friday, when I told
her it was her three-and-a-halfth birthday, she said she was
too little, and also that her next birthday was going to be four!
I was going to bake her a cake, but clearly she wasn't interested
in the half-birthday thing, so I let it go.</p>
<p>She's grown about a mile since last I checked.  I took her into
the school this afternoon when I went in to help Delphine's class put
their jackets on, and I noticed Cordelia is taller than some of
the JKs. I know that's not unusual, but Delphine's always been
so relentlessly 50th percentile in terms of size (once she got
over being a mondo baby, that is), I find it weird to have a
taller-than-average child.  She's gaining on Delphine alarmingly - 
her 3-and-a-half height is only a centimeter or so short of 
Delphine's four height! I wonder how they will end up.</p>
<p>I would say Cordelia has come out of her shell, except anyone
who knows her knows she was never in a shell. But just lately 
she has become even more voluble, more dramatic, more funny,
more opinionated. She's also getting a little 3-and-a-halfish
in the sense that she is provoking power struggles about
stupid things, and over-reacting to things to see how far
that will get her. She's psycho, basically, at least some
of the time. We try to roll with it and not let her faze us
or throw off the whole day.</p>
<p>Cordelia spends a lot of time with Delphine. Yes, they fight
a lot but not all of the time. Delphine reads to her - they 
particularly like Chirp magazines - and... well, I'm not
sure what they do together. This afternoon they spent a good
hour out in the backyard, digging holes with sticks and watering
things which don't need water (like the deck). At one point
Delphine came inside to retrieve matzo, jam and almonds for a 
delectable picnic. It was lovely. For some reason they don't
seem to fight when they're outside. Maybe the house depresses
them as it does me.</p>
<p>Cordelia's all signed up for kindergarten in the fall.  I signed
her up for mornings because she's still napping at least 
five days out of seven. We still don't know whose class she'll
be in. I'm getting to know which are the better kindergarten teachers,
though, so this time I actually care whose class she's in. Hopefully
someone good. (You're not allowed to ask for a particular teacher, 
so if you do they put you in someone else's class on principle. Boo.)</p>
<p>Cordelia can sing! She sings herself to sleep most nights, and a few
weeks ago I was listening to her sing her usual autolullabye, the
ABC song.  She sang, "A B C... A B C... A B C D E F G" - the first
two times she sang it, she sang it on "do do fa". She didn't continue
until she had gotten it right: "do do so". Not only can she sing
in tune but she knows she can sing in tune! Obviously I am now
planning her career as an opera singer - she is very loud.</p>
<p>What else? We are all scheduled to the hilt with summer activities.
Well, more scheduled than last year (ie, we have some plans).  We
have three weeks off at the start of summer, then Delphine is going
to a day camp at a farm in the city.  After that the girls and
I are going to Sask for two weeks, and as soon as we get back
the girls are off to the cottage with Baba and Zaida. (Not sure
if I'm invited or not.) Once they get back, they are both signed
up for a day camp at Cordelia's nursery school. It will be the
first time Cordelia's done all-day anything, and it will be the
first time I have ever had all-day off for five days in a row.
(Except when I was in Sask by myself last September.)</p>
<p>So lots of firsts these days. I realized the other day that I
have no qualms whatsoever about taking the girls downtown on the
bus and subway alone - before, I would always be more comfortable 
if I had another grown-up, but now Delphine can be trusted to
be sensible, and Cordelia responds to verbal commands (sit! stay!)
so I know I don't have to be hanging on to one of them while
praying the other one doesn't do something stupid. It's like they're
real people! Halleluia!</p>

<p><strong><em>Unconditional Parenting</em></strong> <strong>by Alfie Kohn</strong>. If you have been
paying attention here, you  know how much I love Alfie Kohn. But
I've been reluctant to read this, his parenting book, because I
knew it would force me to raise the bar on my parenting, to really 
think about what's behind how I treat my kids.  And I was right, this
was a good read but a tough one.  This isn't a book with a bunch
of techniques or tricks for managing your kids (Alyson Schafer is
your girl for that), but rather a discussion of how traditional
parenting techniques put your kids in the position of having to
earn your love in the form of rewards, praise and attention 
(or avoid your approbation in the form of punishment, time outs
or "consequences").  </p>
<p>Kohn's radical thesis is that children
are human beings and deserving of love and respect no matter
how much they fuck up, and equal love and respect (not more)
when they get it right. He writes about "working with" children
rather than "doing to" them.</p>
<p>Unconditional parenting is hard; it goes so contrary to 
popular wisdom which is all about praise and consequences. It's
also, to be honest, sometimes hard to treat your kids like 
human beings when they act like maniacs, or idiots, or animals.
You have to really try hard to see the human being inside that
crispy exterior and try and respond to her. Which can be
hard when you're tired or in a hurry or otherwise 
resource-challenged.  (One of Kohn's list of recommendations
is "Don't be in a hurry", which is great advice if you can
take it.)</p>
<p>Kohn's arguments are, as always, compelling, well-researched 
and well-supported;
the notes and references seemed to start about two-thirds of
the way through the book. (That's one thing I missed from 
Alyson Schafer's latest book: it just ended. No index, no
references, no further reading, nothing. Girl needs a new
publisher.)  </p>
<p>This is a must-read for me.  I would buy this book if I
weren't such a cheap bastard.</p>
<p><strong><em>Notes from a Small Island</em></strong> <strong>by Bill Bryson</strong>. Bill Bryson
lived in England for a long time (Wikipedia says over twenty
years), and he wrote this book after
he decided to move back to America. For his last hurrah he did
a whirlwind train tour around Britain and wrote all about it.
I love Bill Bryson and I love England, and I love train travel,
so I thought I would love this book, but I found it kind of
sameish after a while. I can't put my finger on why, exactly.
Although I can tell you that despite the fact I went to lots of
different places when I was in England, my trip and Bill's
hardly overlapped at all, so I missed that thrill of reading
about a place I'm familiar with.</p>
<p>My favourite thing about this book is how Bryson gets all sappy
and sentimental about England, because I love it too (although
in a nice-place-to-visit way; I couldn't live there). I was
a bit perplexed, though, by his insistence that Brits are so thoughtful
and polite. In my experience Brits tend to be a bit mean and
rude, if anything (sorry to generalize; usual disclaimers
apply, some of my best friends, etc). They're hot on "manners"
and behaving "properly", but not so much on actually considering
others. Maybe I'm wrong - I was there in middle school
which isn't exactly a hotbed of consideration on any continent.</p>
<p><strong><em>Design Ideas for Home Storage</em></strong> <strong>by Elaine Martin Petrowski</strong>.
Take a guess what this one's about. Yes! A useful book with
lots of good ideas, and plenty of photos (some apparently ripped
straight from the Ikea catalogue). What makes this one a keeper,
though, is that it includes the dimensions you'll need to
make storage design decisions: how high is a kitchen counter,
how much room do you need to hang a pair of pants, etc.  And
last but not least there are instructions for a few simple
storage projects you can build yourself, like a window seat
built from store-bought over-refrigerator cabinets. Brilliant!</p>
<p><strong><em>Ishmael</em></strong> <strong>by Daniel Quinn</strong>.  Okay, my "friend" Ellen picked
this book as our book club read this month. Our relationship might
never be the same. When I found out the premise of this novel
(a philosophy of sustainability explained through a telepathic 
Socratic conversation between a person and a gorilla) I knew I
would hate it. I know, you're not supposed to prejudge things, 
but when you reach a certain age and you've read a few things, 
you know what you're going to like. And what you're going to
hate.</p>
<p>I hated this.  Generally I hate books that are discourses
on philosophy disguised as a novel. I hated <em>Jonathan Livingston
Seagull</em>, I hated <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>.
Okay, that's not true, I guess I liked and found value in both
those books when I read them (when I was much younger), but 
both of them left a bad
taste in my mouth, like I'd been spoken down to. And maybe 
because I'm older and have a stronger sense of my own morality
and philosophy, <em>Ishmael</em> was a thousand times worse.  I felt 
like I was being spoon-fed something really quite
simple: the whole message of the book could be delivered in
a few pages. And on top of that the thesis of the book is
ridiculously flawed: the author manages to lump all the subtlety
and complexity of every non-Western culture into one group,
the "leavers", and says that they're lovely and good people
because they don't take more than they need, not like us
selfish bastards. It's just all so stupid and patronising 
(to the other cultures this time, not to me).</p>
<p>Should make for a good book club discussion, anyway.  (I'm
pretty sure Ellen hates it too - I wonder how everyone
else feels.)</p>

<p>Wow, every paragraph in this post has a parenthetical insertion.  (Except 
this one. (Whoops!))  I think I have a problem.</p>

    <div>
<p>(With thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/bunnyhero/">Bunnyhero</a>, both for the
title, and the inspiration to get blogging again.)</p>
<p>As you can probably guess, if you’ve read Bunnyhero’s <a href="http://www.bunnyhero.org/2009/03/23/too-many-monkeys-a-newbie-lesson-about-viewdidload/">blog post</a>, I recently learned that the AlertView delegate method
<tt>alertView:clickedButtonAtIndex:</tt> can be called <em>multiple times
for one AlertView</em>, much to my surprise.</p>
<p>And here’s how I found that out.  A couple of weeks ago, I ran across a
bug in my still-in-development iPhone game.  I was displaying an alert
when the game ended, and when the user clicked “Okay” it would go to the
next level.  And it all seemed fine until one day, when instead of
clicking the “Okay” button, I hit the home button to exit the game while
the dialog was displayed, and the next time I entered the app, there
were, like, 40 robots where I was expecting 8!</p>
<p>As a favour to a <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/">friend of mine</a> who’s
a prof, I let the bug sit until I could debug the code in front of a
room full of undergrads, as a part of <a href="https://stanley.cdf.toronto.edu/drproject/csc301-2009-01">the software engineering class</a> he teaches.
(The whole experience turned out to not only be something that I wished
I could have seen when I was an undergrad, but also something really fun
to do from the the industry-type person side of things!  Anyone who has
a laptop, and some code with a small bug that they don’t mind showing to
a bunch of students should <em>really</em> give it a try!).  Debugging the
problem led me not to the archiver/unarchiver as I was expecting, but
instead to the observation that when I hit the home button, my delegate
method was being called up to 5 times!</p>
<p>This is why I saw way too many robots, because I was advancing 4 more
levels than I should have been.  And so when I re-entered the game, it
happily put me on level 5-ish, instead of level 2.</p>
<p>The fix was fairly simple, if slightly inelegant.  I merely added in a
flag to tell me when I was handling an alert, and would only advance the
level when I thought I had popped the alert up.  (Now that I write it, I
wonder if I can set the alert’s delegate to nil when I’m done handling
it instead.  Thoughts, anyone?)</p>

<p>I looked and looked for some cool gifts for Blake's birthday,
and largely failed. (I ended up getting him a couple of books 
and some chocolate, always welcome around here.)  However, I
did find a whole heap of stuff I want!  (This is the problem
with shopping, and why I don't do it as a rule.)</p>
<p>Here is my <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cotr46">Lee Valley wish list</a>.
Some glue to fix my wobbly chairs; some flashlights in case of
a blackout (extras so the girls can lose a couple); some
heavy-duty magnets to hold those giant construction paper
projects to the fridge; a solar-powered radio (see above
re: blackout); a sharpener which may or may not wreck my
knives; a completely gratuitous gingerbread house mold I may
never use but which represents the kind of Christmas Mom I
would like to be; and of course the aforementioned mandoline.
Nothing really cool for Blake though.</p>
<p>Then I checked <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">ThinkGeek</a>. They
have lots of cool stuff that Blake <em>might</em> like, but we have
a small house and stuff has to be really awesome to earn a 
place in here, and I just wasn't sure he would like any of
the stuff enough.  But I found 
<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/brain/gimme.cgi?wid=81d9c4027">some stuff I like</a>:
an MP3 player for the girls; an awesome keyboard (with clicky
keys!); a gratuitous but cool alarm clock; more fridge magnets;
another emergency radio; a clock to help the girls learn how
to tell time (whilst also not being criminally ugly!); and a
thing to tell us how much power we're wasting with our three
computers and my stubborn refusal to light my home with greenish-grey
fluorescent lights.</p>

<p>Sometimes I write letters about stuff that isn't very important
in the grand scheme of things.  I sent this to the nice folks
at <a href="http://www.wellappleproducts.com/">Wellesley</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just wanted to let you know how much I love your apple butter!
I am from rural Saskatchewan and some of my neighbours made
apple butter when I was a kid, so I was excited to see it on the
shelf at my grocery store.  I was even more excited when I
tasted it - I don't remember my neighbours' apple butter
being so sublime!  You have definitely figured out the
perfect recipe.</p>
<p>Wellesley Apple Butter is now my gift for people who are
visiting, or for when I go away -- maple syrup is such a
cliche, but apple butter is perfectly local and evocative of
Southern Ontario.  You make it easy to eat locally!</p>
<p>Congratulations!

<p>March break has been great so far but I keep thinking we've done
more than just two days of it.  We've crammed in a lot of excitement
already, so hopefully we didn't peak too soon.</p>
<p>Monday morning we got up nice and slow, and then Delphine and
I did some jobs around the house; we sorted and put away all
the girls' laundry, we baked cookies from a mix she got in a
party loot bag, and Cordelia joined us in cleaning the kitchen
floor, which we did with two buckets of soapy water and a lot
of cloths.  Cordelia mostly splashed around but Delphine really
helped.  She was very agreeable company all morning.</p>
<p>After lunch Delphine went on a bike ride with Blake, and I put
Cordelia down for a nap and then lay down on the couch myself.
I read some of the Globe, then fell asleep and woke up in time for 
Cordelia to wake up and Blake and Delphine to get home.  I
really should have cleaned the kitchen at some point, but
instead Blake suggested we watch <em>The Sound of Music</em>.  So I
popped some popcorn and the girls and I snuggled on the couch
for their second movie ever.</p>
<p>Delphine loved it.   She loved the songs, most of which she
already knew, she loved the children, she loved the story.  She
even got into the romance, which surprised me.</p>
<p>She was really scared by the Captain at
the beginning; she was petrified that the children were going
to get into trouble all the time.  She really doesn't like
stern people, and she's petrified of authority figures, of
getting in trouble, of doing the wrong thing, and of displeasing
authorities.  She gets it from me, and I'm not sure what to
do about it.  Anything? But we talked to her and got her thinking about
whether all rules are worth following, and about whether getting
into trouble is really the worst thing that can happen.  We're
so subversive.</p>
<p>Oh, and she was scared of the Nazis at the end.  (Or the Nasties,
as she called them at first.)  I figure the sooner you learn that
Nazis are scary the better.</p>
<p>Cordelia was a little bit scared of the things Delphine was scared
of, and towards the end of the show she just got bored and started
kicking people.</p>
<p>After the movie, which as it turns out is really really long, I was
all logey and out-of-sorts, which was bad because it was 6:30.
Dinner is supposedly at 6:00, and choir is actually at 7:30, so 
I had -30 minutes to get some food on the table and 30 minutes
to eat and leave to get to choir on time.  I nuked 
a bunch of leftovers (which was, as it turns out, actually the 
plan for dinner), ate, got out the door (with some uncharacteristic
leg-hanging and bawling from Cordelia) and was only about five minutes
late to choir, although out of breath.</p>
<p>Choir was only half-full and I got all cocky and sat off by myself.
I was soon humbled by the realization that I don't know the piece
half as well as I thought I did; without all those voices around me
I missed a few entries and ballsed up a few intervals that I would
have sworn I knew.  Choral singing can make a person really lazy.</p>
<p>The piece we're doing has some really (really really) high notes
and I was feeling very unsure as to how well I was singing them.  Sometimes 
something sounds great in your head but awful outside,
and they're such high, loud, conspicuous notes (the ones in the
sixth movement, for those playing along at home (Dave)) that I
really didn't want to be fucking them up inadvertently.  So I
sucked up my courage to ask the conductor how I was doing. I hoped
he would say I was doing okay but I steeled myself to be cool if
he had a problem, like if I was too loud or flat or something.  I 
know logically that you can only improve by accepting negative
feedback and working on it, but like Delphine I like to be perfect
at things right away because I hate criticism.  </p>
<p>The good news is that my high notes are fine, so now all
I have to work on is the whole rest of the piece.  Sigh.  But I
was pleased with myself for having the nerve to ask about it
rather than make myself miserable second-guessing my high notes for 
the rest of the season. Now I can belt them out with great
confidence!</p>
<p>I came home all fidgety and still out-of-sorts, happy because of
the good feedback but unhappy about the number of mistakes I made,
tired but too wired to go to bed.  I read too many chapters of
<em>Notes from a Small Island</em> by Bill Bryson, and finally fell asleep.</p>
<p>This morning Delphine had a playdate at a friend's house - a really
sweet, vivacious Grade One girl who was in Delphine's kindergarten
class last year.  They don't get together very often now, but they
seem to maintain an affection for one another. So Delphine stayed
there for lunch while Cordelia and I entertained a friend of mine
and her baby. This is a new friend, one of the many lovely and 
clever and interesting people I've met in the last year or two.
She admired my kitchen.  I always appreciate people who admire my
kitchen.</p>
<p>After our company left I managed to stuff some food into Cordelia
and put her down for a nap before Delphine was returned home
after her playdate. Delphine watched some TV while I cleaned
the kitchen and did laundry. (Cleaning the kitchen and doing
laundry seems to be more-or-less my default state.)</p>
<p>At 1:30 I roused Cordelia and we all headed over to the park
to meet Auntie Morgan.  The girls are thrilled to rediscover the
park and explore all their new abilities, developed unwittingly
over the winter.  Cordelia loves to go down the big slides which
scared her last fall, and Delphine can now successfully pump on 
the swings (although she prefers not to).</p>
<p>After an hour or so at the park Cordelia declared she had to go
pee, so we walked over to my friend Tanya's house to use their 
facilities.  (It's important to cultivate friends who live near 
the park.) When they heard we were at the park they thought it 
was such a sovereign idea that they decided to join us, and 
then we bumped into still more friends, and then the ice cream 
truck hove into view!  The park is truly a wonderland of friends 
and unexpected frozen dairy treats.</p>
<p>I was the only person there with money, so I bought four little
ice cream cones for various little people.  I think I got shortchanged 
but getting that much
happiness for under a ten-spot is still a pretty good deal.  Plus
I got to finish Delphine's ice cream.  ("Mama, can you eat this
ice cream for me?  But don't eat the cone.")  </p>
<p>When it was time to leave the park there was some confusion: Delphine
wanted to go pee but didn't want to go home, so we all walked over
to Tanya's place to use her bathroom again. I knew, of course, that
there was no chance that Delphine would just pee and leave - she
and Ursa got to playing and Tanya and I were similarly reluctant
to part company.  I tried to coax Tanya to come to my place for burgers
and hot dogs, but she has been sick and was tired, and she had 
plans to meet her husband, but then it would be easier to come to 
my place than go out, and burgers are yummy, and the girls are having 
such a nice time... we dithered, we weighed options, we wasted a great 
deal of time.  I think Tanya was just too tired to make a decision.</p>
<p>Then I suggested a sleepover and Tanya visibly brightened.  She
asked Ursa if she would like to go for a sleepover at Delphine's
place, and the girls acted as if I had just offered them pink
flying ponies with sparkly tails. So that was a go.  The whole lot
of us walked back to our place (desperately slowly, with several
wipeouts) where I ended up making KD (it was
too late to do burgers and anyway Tanya wasn't staying for dinner).
Everyone ate a bunch of KD and edamame, and Tanya and I had tea.  </p>
<p>And Tanya gave me a wonderful gift!  She's a painter and she painted
me a picture of the red Marmoleum floor that I originally wanted
(with some broken eggs on it). It's fantastic and I need to figure out
where to put it. And which way is up.  (Since it's a picture of the
floor, any way could be up. I get to decide!)</p>
<p>The girls finally got to bed after far too much foolishness, although
they were still awake at 8:40.  Hopefully this means that they will
sleep in.  (Hah.)</p>
