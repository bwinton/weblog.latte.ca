<p>I'm trying to decide if we should keep Delphine in Sparks 
next year. (Sparks is the
precursor to Brownies, for 5- to 6-year-olds.) Delphine has
been in Sparks for the last year, and now the time has 
come to sign up for next year.  But I have serious qualms.  </p>
<p>Guides is supposed to be about empowering girls and
allowing them to build confidence, and yet they're going
about it all wrong. The organization decides what girls
should be interested in (by making badges available), 
decides how they should go about exploring those 
interests (the bullet-point items you have to fulfill
before getting a badge) and then rewards them for
their interest. Rewarding kids for things is a <em>proven
demotivator</em>. And worse, in Sparks the girls haven't
even had a chance to express their own interests: the
meetings are predetermined at the beginning of the
year. The girls' interests don't even come into play!
It's incredibly disappointing to see a great
opportunity to excite and engage girls be squandered
because the adults involved lack the knowledge or
imagination to do things differently.</p>
<p>Of course it's a giant crapshoot how good your troop is
going to be because the Guide organization doesn't provide
all that much, well, guidance on how to plan and run meetings.
You might get amazing leaders who do know how to motivate
and engage kids, or your girls might be stuck with a group
of unruly kids led by frustrated adults yelling at them to shut
up and get on with the Pointless Craft of the Day.</p>
<p>And if that weren't annoying enough, you have to sign an
idiotic release form every time the troop does anything
out of the ordinary. If the organization is that risk-averse,
how are they going to help my girls become fearless?</p>
<p>Finally it's expensive. The annual fee is $125, there's a $1 dues
  charge at every meeting, and twice a year we have to pay
  $96 for those lousy cookies (and then dispose of them as we see fit).
  Plus we had to buy a shirt and sash. I suppose compared to
the $250 or so that we spend on most 12-week programs Guides
isn't actually all the pricey, but they seem to keep leeching
at us all year instead of just once up front.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Delphine really enjoys it. But then
she really enjoys 
watching Backyardigans and eating gummy worms too.</p>

<p>Here is the how I throw thing out:</p>
<p>I recycle: plastic containers and glass (the plastic containers
with their lids on but not the glass containers), tin cans, styrofoam,
cardboard cans with their metal lids, plastic bags but only the 
ones from stores, and not the bags that milk bags come in which are
completely identical but for some reason unacceptable. That's okay,
I save them for cat litter. Also plastic
bags must be recycled in bunches, not one by one. Further I save
the bags without holes in them to contain regular garbage and
compost, which means that I have three separate streams into
which plastic bags can possibly go. Also recyclable are newspapers,
magazines, and regular paper but not paper that the girls have
glued random crap onto, nor stickers (too sticky, they gum up
the recycling works).</p>
<p>Speaking of compost, that's the City of Toronto compost which
accepts all the usual vegetable matter as well as any other food
(except gum), paper plates and napkins (but not paper cups from 
coffee shops), diapers, kleenex and paper towels, tea bags, cat 
litter and dog poo but not cotton balls, q-tips, or hair and 
fingernail clippings. (Because that would be gross.)</p>
<p>Outside, there's yard waste, which is weeds and leaves and
twigs and stuff but not grass clippings.</p>
<p>Then there's the stuff which isn't garbage yet, the clothes and
toys and furniture and housewares we don't need. Some of that
I'm saving for the school's fundraising garage sale, some of
it goes into the Goodwill bag for when Andy does a Goodwill run,
and some of the toys I'm saving for that mythical day when I sort
out all their pieces and find their manuals and take them to the 
consignment store.</p>
<p>Finally, as a last resort, there's regular garbage:
anything that doesn't
fit into the above categories, mainly rejected plastic bags and
other plastic packaging, and broken things.</p>
<p>I hate throwing things out because it's complicated.  It's 
hard to believe that fifty years ago people just threw
everything away in one container. How simple! Which
is exactly why it's dangerous — it can't be that easy
to get rid of things. You have to be mindful of whether your
trash still has value, as a source of energy
or materials, or to someone else in its current form. And
when I'm feeling sorry for myself because it's so hard to throw
something out I remind myself that I wouldn't have this
problem if I didn't bring that thing into my house in the first
place.</p>

<p>In the last few weeks I have had no fewer than four conversations
about the impending apocalypse. Not ironic conversations,
either.  (Well, one of them involved zombies, but the others were
in earnest.) One of my friends has a plan for what to do if 
America annexes Canada. Another is trying to work out how to
feed her family with what she can grow in her backyard.</p>
<p>We are all serious. We all believe that the world is
going to change drastically in the next twenty to fifty years,
and it's by no means clear that the changes will go smoothly.
We face climate change, a crisis in the food distribution networks,
a global pandemic, peak oil, economic collapse, and even (this one is new!)
loss of electrical service due to a 
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/djulc7">massive solar storm</a>.  There's
a palpable sense among my peer group that we're living in
a fantasy, that the life we live is too good to last.  We've 
built an edifice so high, so fragile and so glorious that
it is bound to come tumbling down.</p>
<p>Does anyone else feel this way? Is it just me and my weird 
friends? Admittedly we all tend to be overthinkers, we are
all a little fringey and cynical and mistrustful of 
common knowledge and received wisdom.  The mainstream media
seems oblivious: articles in the Globe only occasionally
mention climate change, apart from the articles <em>on</em>
climate change off in the "Science" ghetto.  There was
fear of a flu pandemic a few years ago, but after it died
down no-one mentioned the danger again until this latest
outbreak of swine flu, despite the fact that the risk
of a flu pandemic never actually changed. As for the
food thing, no-one seems to be acting on the fact that 
our food production and distribution system is a house of
cards, apart from a few urban foodies who are willing to
pay hundreds of dollars for a share in a nearby farm.
There doesn't seem to be a meaningful political response to
any of these threats, perhaps because the time-frame is
so vague, so unfittable into four-year terms.</p>
<p>Ever since the 9/11 / blackout / SARS conflagration of
debacles the Government has been encouraging us to have an <a href="http://www.getprepared.gc.ca/index_e.asp">emergency preparedness kit</a>
containing enough food, water, flashlights, blankets and 
medical supplies to last 72 hours. That's a good start, but
that's <em>so</em> not the scale of emergency I'm worrying about.
I'm talking weeks or months or years of upheaval followed by an
entirely new way of life.  </p>
<p>So what am I doing?  Well, 
mainly just worrying,
and speculating. What's gonna happen if... the power goes
out? How long before Toronto cuts down all its famous trees
for heat and cooking?  What if... Canada is deluged by climate
refugees? How many people will we have to share our 2700 square
foot of land with in order to live sustainably?  What if... 
there's a flu epidemic? Will the grocery store shelves be
empty? Should I buy more flour?</p>
<p>We've done all the major things we can
afford to do. We live centrally so we don't need a car. Just
by sheer luck we happen to live in the middle of one of the best
patches of arable land in Canada, so provided they don't 
build McMansions all over it we should be well-placed
for a mainly-local-food diet. We have a tiny house which is
cheap to heat and stays pretty cool in summer. We're trying 
to grow our own vegetables.  One day we'll get some solar 
panels so we aren't entirely dependent on the electrical grid.</p>
<p>But we're not that crazy!  We're not stockpiling food, or 
medicine, or seeds, or
guns.  We're not going off the grid. We're not building a
bunker. It's hard for me to discern what's too crazy. I was
wondering if it would be worth learning how to salt-cure meat,
in case the power goes off when we have a freezer full of
beef. But then I'd have to stockpile a lot of salt, and that
seems to be beyond the too-crazy mark. On the other hand I
do intend to find out how to purify water so we can drink
the water from the rain barrel if the taps dry out.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel stupid, worrying about this stuff. Other
people don't seem to.  What if everything turns out fine?
Won't I look silly then? But stupid doesn't begin to describe
how I'll feel if something does happen and I'm not prepared,
at least as prepared as I can be. In the meantime, life 
goes on; I shave my legs and get my hair cut and sing 
and take my children to school. I carry on. I bet you
can't even tell I'm crazy.</p>

<p>Something's not quite right in my life; I'm out of balance.
Fortunately — and I know this is rare — I know what's wrong
and I have a pretty good idea how to fix it.</p>
<p>A few months ago I got this laptop. It's a Toshiba Satellite
with a Celeron (celery!) processor and 192 MB of RAM. It's
running Windows XP and it's really, really slow. (I should
probably switch to Ubuntu.)  Nevertheless,
it's a laptop, and that means I can fart around on the Internet
while we watch TV, after the girls are in
bed. That's good because it adds an extra couple of hours
to my Internet day, giving me time to blog and Twitter. It's
bad because somehow the combination of TV and Internet makes
it very, very hard for me to get off my butt and go to bed
at a reasonable hour, leaving me cranky and exhausted the 
next day.  The other bad is that I don't write
particularly well when I'm watching TV, and I don't watch
TV particularly well when I'm writing.  The TV I watch 
tends to reward attentive viewing, and half-watching it is
worse than either watching it or not watching it at all.</p>
<p>Simple problem, simple fix: I'm going to stop using the
laptop in the evenings, and instead watch TV properly, or 
read if it's one of Blake's shows.  I'll go to bed at a 
decent hour, which will give me the energy to write in the 
afternoons. Currently my afternoons are spent either
napping (on the really bad days) or reading, with a little
light housekeeping if I absolutely have to. I'm not sure
whether writing in the afternoon will deal too much of a
blow to my reading time; I hope I will be able to get to
bed by ten and read until eleven, and maybe read in the
mornings sometimes too.</p>
<p>All this is temporary, of course: once Cordelia is in 
school everything will change again and I'll have to find
a new balance.</p>

<p><strong><em>Getting Started As A Freelance Writer</em></strong> <strong>by Robert Bly (2008)</strong>
is about... well, just guess what it's about. It  was on the "new"
cart at the library so I thought I would check it out. Maybe I
can be a freelance writer! Here's how!</p>
<p>Robert Bly has written about a million books, almost all of which
you undoubtedly haven't heard of, and he also writes magazine articles,
marketing material, annual reports, brochures, junk email... pretty
much anything you can make money at. He's not an "author" or a 
"novelist", he's a writer, and in this book he tells you how you
can make a living as a writer too.</p>
<p>Obviously it's hard for me to say whether his advice is any good since
I'm not a writer, nor have I ever read any other books on making
a living as a writer.  It seems pretty sensible - he offers practical
advice on how to set up your office, how to market yourself, how to manage
your writing business, how to find work - but then this guy makes
most of his living writing "direct mail marketing" copy, ie, snake
oil ads.  Bly also makes lots of money through self-published ebooks, 
booklets, giving speeches,
selling CDs of his speeches... basically regurgitating the same
content in as many ways as possible to get more money out of it.</p>
<p>The book also contains sections on gettings cartoons, personal
essays, and poems published.</p>
<p>Ironically, the book could have been better written, or perhaps
better edited. There were a couple of times where he introduced
the same concept twice within a page or two, as if he had rearranged
some paragraphs and then not checked it closely enough.  (This,
I suppose, supports his contention that you don't have to be
a <em>good</em> writer to make a living at it.) The section on the
Internet was terribly dated; "If you think, as some people do,
that there's any future in the Internet". (That's a paraphrase,
I forgot to write down the exact quote.) This edition was a rework
of the 1997 edition, and clearly he should have paid more attention
to the Internet section.</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether this book convinced me that you can make good
money writing, or whether it just showed that you can make money
doing just about anything if you are willing to work hard enough
at selling yourself, and repackaging your material in lots of different
ways. The more I think about it the more it seems what made Bob Bly
rich wasn't being a writer but being an entrepreneur, which is not
to say that you can't make money writing, but Bly's path to riches
isn't exactly the path I want to take.</p>
<p>One more thing - Bob Bly makes lots of money selling books about
how to be a copywriter, and on further investigation there's a
whole online cottage industry of ebooks, email newsletters, etc 
about writing. Doesn't that
seem like a pyramid scheme? Bly sells a book about writing to 2000
people, those people write and sell 2000 books each - what happens when
everyone who wants to be a writer has bought a book about it?
Doesn't someone, at some point, have to write about something
else?</p>
<hr>
<p>Thomas Foster mentioned the novels of Reginald Hill a few times
in <em>How to Read Novels Like A Professor</em>, so when I found
<strong><em>Pictures of Perfection</em></strong> in a plastic bag at someone's curb,
I picked it up. It says on the cover that it's a Dalziel/Pascoe
mystery, but Dalziel and Pascoe are fairly minor players; the
main investigator is a policeman (I can never remember people's
rank) named Wield who is sent off to an odd little village in
Yorkshire - odd not in the usual Yorkshire way - to discover the
whereabouts of the missing village bobby. On the way to locating
the missing policeman, Wield meets various peculiar village
characters and has to sort out their relationships, their
history, and their intentions. </p>
<p>Reginald Hill writes for an intelligent reader - this book is 
rich with references to literature and music. He has a knack
for describing things in a way which makes you pay attention.
Here he is saying someone has a good memory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wield's brain, which his CID chief, Andy Dalziel, opinied 
should be picked in strong ale and and sold to IBM after the
sergeant's death, had been punching up references to Enscombe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here he says the same character is hairy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wield barked the sound which his friends recognized as his way
of expressing amusement - though others often took it as a 
sign that the interrupted lycanthropic process suggested by
his face was about to be resumed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not writing for a lazy reader.</p>
<p>I very much enjoyed this book; I liked the characters, I liked
the relationships, I liked the mystery.</p>

<p>Delphine has gotten to be pretty picky at the dinner
table, and after one too many "I hate this!"es, Blake
and I decided to let Delphine pick every dinner this
week. Blake walked her through picking things that
are on sale, and he also advised her on the standard
protein-vegetable-starch distribution of a meal.</p>
<p>So this is what we're having this week. Try and guess
which words Delphine wrote and which were Blake's (Blake
likes Random Capitalization and Punctuation):</p>
<ul>
<li>Mashed Potatoes &amp; Hot Dogs AND (charred) ESPARAGIS</li>
<li>Pizza with Pepperoni &amp; Tomato</li>
<li>Chicken Sandwiches &amp; cut up apples &amp; Corn on the cob.</li>
<li>Burritos (Beans, tomato, cooked carrots, cheese)</li>
<li>SRINP ring AND GRILD cheese SANWICHES BOK CHOY???</li>
</ul>
<p>Should be a tasty week.</p>

<p><strong><em>Trust Your Children: Voices Against Censorship in Children's Literature</em></strong> <strong>by Mark West (1997)</strong> is a collection of interviews with children's 
book authors, publishers and librarians on the subject of censorship.
My local library had a display of books on censorship, and the 
title of this seemed in keeping with my parenting philosophy, so
I picked it up.  I'm pretty naive about censorship because I don't really see
the point of it, so I don't think about it much. This book
was a pointed reminder of how some people dislike some ideas
so much they don't even want them to be mentioned. Back in the
seventies and eighties censorship was largely about sex, but
these days (well, when the book was written) more people 
complain about anti-authoritarian themes, books where the kids
best the adults, books where kids question the rules, and even books
where kids are portrayed as unhappy.</p>
<p>Judy Blume got more mentions, if I recall correctly, than any
other author. I'm not surprised by that, but I am saddened;
Judy Blume was a staple of my childhood. I never got The Sex Talk
from my mother, but it was fine because between Judy Blume and
the other books I read I pretty much knew what to do and what
not to do when the time came.</p>
<p>A more subtle issue is that of self-censorship by authors and
publishers. Honestly, what's the use of writing something if
it's just going to be taken out, or result in your book not
being bought by libraries?  One of the solutions, and a flawed
one to be sure, is to market your teen book as an adult book,
which I was surprised to find actually happens. Apparently
Judy Blume's first adult book, wasn't.</p>
<p>This is a valuable compendium of perspectives, with lots of
history and context. It would be nice to read an updated version
of this book - there are lots of references to the Reagan
administration in the book, and I would love to know how the
Bush and Obama administrations affected censorship of kids' 
books.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mindset: The New Psychology of Success</em></strong> <strong>by Carol S. 
Dweck, Ph. D. (2006)</strong>. Carol Dweck is a social psychologist who
specialises in motivation, personality and development.  Her
mindset theory is hot in democratic parenting circles, and
it deals a death blow to the idea that you have to constantly
praise your children for any and all achievements. I was 
very glad to hear this behaviour has been discredited because
I hate hearing parents constantly chirp, "good sharing!", "good 
swinging!", "good falling down!". (Unfortunately, most people
don't seem to have heard that praising sucks, but I'm trying
to spread the word.) As you might guess, Alfie Kohn 
refers to Dweck's work in his <em>Punished by Rewards</em>, so I thought
I might as well read this book to get the full story straight
from the horse's mouth.</p>
<p>Dweck's argument is that everyone walks around with one of two
mindsets: the fixed mindset wherein you believe that everyone
is born with a fixed set of talents and abilities which will
remain constant for life, and the growth mindset
wherein you believe that those talents you are born with are
just the beginning; everything you do can be improved by 
study and practice. If you have a fixed mindset, you believe
that you are what you are, and so your main motivation is to
prove that what you are is fabulous. If you have a growth
mindset you believe that you can always get better, so you
don't have to prove anything, you just have to figure out
what needs work and get on with it. Or not: it's your life!</p>
<p>The book discusses how mindset applies in business, in sports,
in romance, and in parenting. It's nicely written for a
non-scientific audience, leavened by plenty of anecdotes, 
some of which are about Carol Dweck's own journey from fixed
mindset to growth mindset. The book also offered some concrete
advice on how to change your own mindset, and how to help
your children grow up with a growth mindset.</p>
<p>I think understanding the two mindsets is important to anyone
who wants to understand their own mind and motivation, and reading
this book is probably the best and most direct way to learn about
them. You could probably safely skip the chapters on business or
sports or parenting if they don't apply to you.</p>
<p><strong><em>new day revolution</em></strong> <strong>by Sam Davidson and Stephen Moseley (2007)</strong>
is a book about how easy it is to make the world better, written, I assume,
to convince those who might otherwise not bother to lift a finger to
help out. And lifting a finger is about as much as this book asks:
it proposes such strenuous tasks as "call someone you haven't spoken
to lately", "learn your barista's name", or "watch a documentary
instead of a blockbuster".  They have a laudatory profile of a woman
who gave up the use of her car... for <em>one whole day</em>. This book
sets the bar so low that I'm fairly sure that anyone who would
be interested in it would already have done the
calibre of world-improvement activities they suggest. If you need
the advice in this book, you wouldn't bother to pick it up.</p>
<p>Also there was a spelling mistake on the second page.  Pff.</p>

<p>I did something new today.  A while ago, I had bought a 10-speed Bianchi
for $30 at a garage sale, with the intention of converting it into a
fixed-gear/single-speed bike to tootle around on.  Well, today, I took it
down to <a href="http://bikechain.utoronto.ca/" title="Bikechain at U of T">Bikechain</a>,
and talked to Steve, who sent me on a merry goose chase picking up various
parts.  Once I had gotten a new wheel, tire, and tube and biked back to
Biekchain, Steve and I put it on the bike, checked the alignment of the
cogs and chain, and then I had to head out to buy a new rear cog, and a
lock wheel…</p>
<p>Sadly, my bike didn’t have a functional rear wheel anymore, so I had to
walk down to <a href="http://www.ucycle.com/" title="My local-ish cycle
shop">Urbane Cyclist</a> to buy the cog and lock.  I ended up with a 52:19 ratio, which is
harder to start on than the gear ratio I use to start, but isn’t too bad,
and doesn’t go as fast as the gear ratio I use to go fast, but again isn’t
too bad.  Given those two things, I figure it’s pretty close to perfect for
my style and level of riding.  When I got the cog and lock ring back to
<a href="images/blake/bike/fixie/BikeAndMe_l.jpg"><img src="images/blake/bike/fixie/BikeAndMe_s.jpg" title="I like it so…" alt="Me and my Fixie." align="left"></a>
Bikechain, we put them on the new rear wheel, hooked everything up, ran
into the obligatory problems, fixed them, and finally I was good to go, so
I did!  The first trip I took was a fairly short one, from U of T over to
the <a href="http://code.davidjanes.com/blog/2009/04/15/coffee-and-iphone-tomorrow/">Dark Horse Cafe</a> at
Queen and Spadina.</p>
<p>The second trip was from Queen and Spadina back home, which was a little
longer.  I learned a few things from that trip, but let me start off with
something I didn’t learn.  I had test-ridden a fixed gear bike before, so I
had already been almost bumped off by trying to coast, and this time around
I was expecting it.  So, now on to the things I did learn.</p>
<p><br clear="all"></p>
<ul>
<li>Stopping is hard.  It’s not that I can’t stop.  I’ve got both brakes and
  pedals.  The problem is stopping with one of the pedals in a decent
  position to start from when I want to start.  The other problem is that I
  really want to coast when I come to the end of a stop, and that totally
  doesn’t work.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="images/blake/bike/fixie/Carry_l.jpg"><img src="images/blake/bike/fixie/Carry_s.jpg" title="I can carry it." alt="My favourite feature." align="right"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I can carry it!  (As you can see over on the right there.)  My commuter
  bike is a good ride, and very solid, but damn is it ever heavy,
  especially after I loaded it up with accessories like a rear rack, and
  panniers, and water bottles.  The fixie is simple, clean, and light
  enough to carry all over the place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fixie is slower than my commuter bike.  Not just slower for the
  obvious reason (because I don’t have a higher gear to switch to), but
  it’s also slower for me to start, because I don’t have a lower gear to
  switch to.  It’s really kind of strange, since one of the things I seem
  to be really good at is starting really quickly from a dead stop.  Well,
  that used to be one of the things I was really good at.  On the fixie,
  not so much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though it’s slower I found that the fixie was a far smoother ride.
  Thinking about it a little more, perhaps because it’s slower.  Since it
  takes me so much longer to stop and start, I found myself slowing down
  earlier to try and conserve as much momentum as I could.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All in all, I think that the new bike is going to be really good for me.
  It’ll slow me down, and calm me down, which are two things that I think I
  could use.  I can also feel how it’s changing the way I ride, making it
  more smooth, controlled, and thoughtful; keeping my legs moving to give
  me more exercise and stop them from seizing up; teaching me how to lift
  my butt off the seat to go over speed bumps while continuing to pedal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s fun.  A lot of fun.  I’m glad I finally got the conversion done, and
I’m really looking forward to riding it.</p>
