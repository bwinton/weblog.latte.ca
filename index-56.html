<p>This evening at dinner Blake was talking to Cordelia about
names. He asked what her name is. She replied "Cordelia
Winton!" (It's not.) He asked her what Delphine's name is:
"Delphine Winton!" He asked her what my name is: "Mummy
Winton!"</p>
<hr>
<p>Delphine is at Auntie Morgan's place for her birthday sleepover
tonight. They went out for dinner, and tomorrow they're going
to Sunnybrook Park, among other things. Sunnybrook Park was
Delphine's choice, even though I don't think she's ever been
there. I hope it lives up to her expectations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Cordelia is home with us for a sleepunder. One of
the perks of a sleepunder is getting to choose dinner—we
had Chinese. Another is that you get to sleep in the Big Bed
if you want to. So far no-one has ever taken us up on the Big
Bed thing, but Cordelia's in the Big Bed right now. (It's nine
o' clock and she's not asleep yet, so she may yet end up sleeping
in her own bed.)</p>
<p>Tomorrow we might go out for breakfast, but we spent a lot
of money on dinner so maybe not. The school in which Cordelia's
nursery school is located is having their spring fair, so we
might go to that too. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>It was pleasant having only Cordelia tonight. She's 
charming and funny and nice to be around. Oddly (not
really) when Delphine is around they're both annoying about
forty percent of the time. Yet Delphine is great by herself too;
we hung out together this morning at Yonge and Eg and she
wasn't annoying or snotty, she was mellow and interesting and
engaged. Blake and I thought there could
be a real future in a boarding school with a Sibling 
Mutual Exclusivity Schedule Option.</p>
<hr>
<p>The other day Delphine and I had a long conversation about
World Wars. It started when we stopped to look at an old
print of a WWII battleship in a storefront on Mount Pleasant.
Delphine wanted to know who started the war, who fought,
how they fought, who won. The whole conversation made me
realize how little I know about it—I guess it's time
for a trip to the library... We talked about different kinds
of guns, about guns on airplanes, about tanks.  I told her 
about attacks on cities. I told her about the
Enigma machine. We talked about what Daddy would do if there
was another World War—we decided we hope he would stay
home and work the computers, not go into battle.</p>
<p>It was an interesting conversation. It reminded me once again
about the incredibly huge amount of knowledge you have to 
absorb before you can even begin to understand our world. I
mean, not only do you have to know about the World Wars, you
also have to know about the Holocaust and slavery and the
Black Death. You have to know about The Beatles and Elvis
and Queen and Fred Astaire and tap dancing. You have to know
about gasoline and dinosaurs and planets and the atmosphere.
You have to know how to wash cotton, how to cook rice, how
to floss, how to make a new friend, how to approach a strange
dog, how to use the phone and the library. The human brain 
is astonishing.  I'm reminded of that when Delphine and 
I come up against some huge body of knowledge which she's 
hardly begun to explore. There's so much for her to 
learn. But she's made a pretty good start.</p>
<p>Apparently the World Wars conversation has provided
plenty of playtime fodder. The following day Delphine told
me that she and Pierce and Jaime played castles in school,
and they bombed and shot at each other's castles. What fun!</p>

<p>Blake and I are watching the season 3 premier of <em>Burn Notice</em>
(hooray!) and I was trying to figure out who the management
guy in the helicopter was. </p>
<p>I said, "That's the dad from..."</p>
<p>Blake paused the show while I remembered.</p>
<p>"...from Frasier. I knew it was the dad from something. Cool."</p>
<p>Blake said, "He was also in <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>."</p>

<p>The patch started off by adding a “Reply to List” button to the message
header pane as seen below, but after some discussion, the scope was
expanded to change the “Reply” button to “Reply All” or “Reply to List”,
depending on the message you’re currently viewing.</p>
<p><img alt="First cut of the Reply to List button" src="https://bug45715.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=364625" title="Reply to List"></p>
<p>Of course, there’s still some things I’ve got to add, but those can go in a
separate patch, which will be much smaller, and so much easier to get
reviewed and committed.  And once it is, we might be able to close a
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45715">9-year old bug</a>,
which would be pretty sweet.</p>

<p><strong><em>Copyediting: A Practical Guide</em></strong> <strong>by Karen Judd</strong> is another guide
to copyediting very much like the last one I read, <em>The
Fine Art of Copyediting</em> by Elsie Myers Stainton. Both offer an
overview of what copyediting entails, along with lots of reference
material: when to use which punctuation, how to capitalize titles,
and so on. Either book would be a valuable addition to a writer
or copyeditor's library.</p>
<p>I don't think copyediting is a good career direction for me;
I revel in the satisfaction of finding obvious mistakes (doesn't everyone?) 
but I would get impatient having to look up everything I wasn't sure
about.  I could be a copyeditor, but I wouldn't enjoy it much.
(Although Judd actually says, 'Copyediting isn't fun," so maybe I'm
missing the point.) But having read these two books, I now know more
about good grammar, good writing and punctuation. Once I start
writing for real I'll buy one of these books and refer to it often.
My editors will love me.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Craft and Business of Writing: Essential Tools for Writing 
Success</em></strong> is a collection of essays about writing, from the
editors of Writers' Digest Books. It's divided
into five sections: Getting Started / General Business, Fiction,
Nonfiction, Children's Writing, and Poetry. Each of the last four
sections is further subdivided into "The Craft of..." and "The
Business of..." The essays are great, both helpful and inspiring.
However, for some reason
they chose to wire-bind the book and wrap it in a giant hardcover like
a big ol' cookbook. Made it very hard to read it in bed,
while brushing teeth, on the can, etc: all my best reading 
spots. So it has taken me weeks to read it. Between the dry-as-dust 
copyediting books and this I've been all clogged up in my reading.</p>
<hr>
<p>A while ago <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/">Greg Wilson</a> suggested I
write a book about survival in the event of a disaster or
collapse of our modern infrastructure.  Seemed like a fine
idea, so I thought I would find out what was already out there.
A few years ago I read James Howard Kunstler's <em>The Long
Emergency: Surviving the Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First
Century</em>, and I briefly revisited it. Then as now, it left me more
scared than prepared. The book mainly discusses what's going to
go horribly wrong. The last chapter deals with how we might manage
the process, but it's mainly prognostication and very little advice.</p>
<p>However, <strong><em>When All Hell Breaks Loose: Stuff You Need to Survive When 
Disaster Strikes</em></strong> <strong>by Cody Lundin</strong> is rich in advice on how to
survive a week or a few months without the modern conveniences we
take for granted. </p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts: "Head Candy" 
and "Hand Candy". Head Candy covers a wide range of philosophical, 
psychological, and physiological concerns, including posttraumatic 
stress disorder, consensus decision making, the power of gratitude, 
the importance of positive thinking. . . . Plenty of the material is
valuable, such as the importance of continuing to communicate
with your family, recognizing the signs of excess stress in 
others, and the impact of fear on physical function, but there's
plenty that could be left out too. There's a lot of woo-woo stuff
about thinking positive, and putting good vibes into the universe to
get good stuff back.</p>
<p>You're 84 pages into the book
before you get into the nitty-gritty of what you're gonna need
and how much of it.  That's the Hand Candy section, each 
chapter of which covers a
particular need: shelter, water, food, sewage
disposal, hygiene, light, heat for cooking, first-aid, self-defense,
communication, transport, and how to get out if you have to.<br>
Although the book is written in a light-hearted, humourous way, 
Lundin doesn't
talk down to his readers: each chapter starts with a technical description
of the matter at hand. For example, in the food chapter Lundin 
discusses the
different sources of calories (protein, fat and carbs) and how the 
body metabolizes each one.  He also devotes a page to explaining
the Glycemic Index, two to calculating your Basal Metabolic Rate, 
and three on an overview of Great Food Shortages in History, most
of which resulted in people eating each other (just in case you
weren't sure whether you wanted to store some food).  The light
section has two pages on the history of artificial lighting and
a one-page primer on batteries. And so on.</p>
<p>I would call this book over-written. Or maybe under-edited. Personally,
I love all this information, but then I thrive on non-fiction. 
I'm not sure that the average reader wants this much background 
in a book of this nature. However, if you can get through all 
the extra stuff, the advice in here is gold. Lundin has years 
of hands-on experience
living off the grid, living in the wild and leading survival 
courses. The book is rich with anecdotes and advice direct from 
experience, and when Lundin doesn't know something and couldn't
find it out, he's blunt about it. (Like, how long does whole
wheat keep anyway?)  He is pragmatic and considerate of 
all your family members—for example, a couple of times he
specifically addresses the needs of obese people without
being judgemental.</p>
<p>I took copious notes while reading this
book, and I now have a very long list of things to do and buy. Once
I've done them all I will feel much more prepared in the event of
something going horribly wrong for quite a long time.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you should think that planning for a long-term
failure of some or most of our infrastructure is paranoid, you
might not know that the CDC's worse-case scenario pandemic
plan involves the general public staying home for up to three
months. Or maybe a <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16400-major-solar-storm-could-cause-lasting-damage.html">solar storm</a> will knock
out the power grid indefinitely. The fact is I'd rather be 
ready and wrong.</p>

<p>This post could be filed under either "books" or
under "Delphine", because as usual, in
<strong><em>Your Six-Year-Old: Loving and Defiant</em></strong>, <strong>Louise Bates
Ames and Frances Ilg</strong> have nailed the phase my kid
is going through like they were observing her
personally.  Here are some quotes from the book
which describe what's going on around here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things often get so bad around the house that, as one
mother put it, "Each morning I get up with the solemn 
promise to myself to try and make my daughter fell loved. 
And I may succeed for an hour or so. But then she'll do 
something so impossible that I lose my temper and have to 
reprimand her." [I usually do better than an hour or so;
Delphine's pretty great in the mornings. It's after school
that she's almost intolerable.]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Six's way is, in his opinion, right; he cannot bear to lose 
or to accept criticism. On the other hand, he loves to be
flattered and praised. Certainly he is not as secure as 
he might be.  In fact, we believe that much of his stubborn, 
arrogant, and sometimes bratty behavior is his effort to build 
himself up and to make himself feel secure.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>His capacity for enjoyment is tremendous. Make him a present
or surprise, give him praise, propose a treat, and his vigorously
expressed joy and enthusiasm will well repay you. [Delphine
often tells me I'm "the best mum ever!" for something as 
simple as ice cream for dessert.]</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Six is at his best and also his worst with the <em>primary</em>
caregiver.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>[On siblings] But on the whole, his competitive, combative
nature and his need to always be first and to win out, make certain
difficulty in the household. . . . He tends to be very jealous
of attention or objects given to to a brother or sister. . . .
Six may be very bossy with younger siblings. He may argue,
tease, bully, frighten, torment, get angry, hit.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>If your daughter is one of the many with a very sensitive
scalp, who screams bloody murder as you comb her hair, a short
haircut (if she will accept it [hah]) can save much anguish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously Ames and Ilg have Delphine's number. They also have
some insight into why it's so difficult to be six:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the Six-year-old's biggest problems is his relationship
with his mother. It gives him the greatest pleasure and the
greatest pain. Most adore their mother, think the world of
her, need to be assured and reassured that she loves them. 
At the same time, whenever things go wrong, they take things
out on her.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>We must remember that a Six-year-old isn't violent, loud,
demanding, and often naughty just to be bad. There are so
many things he wants to do and be that his choices are not 
always fortunate. He is so extremely anxious to do well, 
to be the best, to be first, to be loved and praise, that 
any failure is very hard for him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They offer a list of helpful techniques: praise, chances (second, third,
etc), counting, sidestepping the issue, bargaining, giving 
in, ignoring misbehaviour. It's not the most rigorous year
of parenting, but it seems that Six is a year to be 
endured, for child and parent alike, at least until Six-and-a-half.</p>

<p>This is our third summer in this house and I'm finally starting
to get some inkling of an idea of what to do with the garden.</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/backyard.jpg" align="right"></p>
<p>Today we dug up some of that unreasonable raspberry patch
and replaced it with a blueberry plant that Blake bought on impulse
this weekend. we should probably mulch it, but we don't have
any mulch. I also moved a few of the ostrich ferns which had
been stranded between the fence and the deck when we built the
deck. They were on either side of the pathway you see on
the bottom right there, and they were in danger of being trampled.
So I dug a nice new bed on the opposite side of the garden,
by the fence about halfway back, and moved five of the ferns 
over there. I'm 
going to get some huechera to go in between and it should be
quite charming. I love ostrich ferns—I told Blake I would
be happy if our garden was, like, forty percent ferns. They even
smell good.</p>
<p>We spent a lot of time cleaning out the hedge in the front yard.
I don't really want that hedge but I haven't come up with anything
better to do there so we're keeping it for now, but it's a mess.
Lots of different things growing in it, to the extent that
I had to arbitrarily decided which species was the "real"
hedge and then yank out anything that wasn't that, including
a truly irritating number of maple treelets.  I'm not sure
what the hedge is made up of, but I've noticed a few hedges
of it in the neighbourhood so it must be something pretty
standard. While I was checking out other people's 
hedges I noticed more than
a few which were lousy with maple. One was mainly maple. </p>
<p>The last big accomplishment today was moving the composter from
the neighbour's yard to ours. They are shiny urban hipsters
and composting isn't really their thing—the composter was left
by the previous owner—so they said we could have it. We
tucked it just behind the new fern bed, not too far from the
house that we won't use it, but not too close either. It's
not terribly ugly and I think once the ferns grow up more 
it will be mostly concealed.</p>
<p>Incidentally, having our own compost will yet further complicate
throwing stuff out, because now we'll have two categories of
compost: backyard compost (fruit and veg scraps, tea and coffee,
and yard waste) and city compost (leftovers, meat, kleenex, all that
gross stuff). So we'll need two containers on the kitchen counter.
There's gotta be a good way to do that but I haven't figured it
out yet.</p>
<h5>The Plan</h5>
<p>Okay, "plan" is a little grandiose for something that's not much
more than a collection of notions. First, as you can see I've
covered a fair bit of ground with that giant playstructure.
For now I'm happy to have that area be weeds and dirt, and it's
happy to oblige. So that's a good 320 square foot I don't have to
worry about. (Well, I planted some scarlet runner beans to grow up it
just for fun.)</p>
<p>I want to create a path between the back gate and garage, and the
front gate (which is where the path by the deck leads).  Ideally 
that would be some kind of cool flagstone path, either with rectangular
flagstones or crazy paving, but for now we'll have to settle for
the leftover Unilock from those same neighbours' previous front
path. It would also make sense to pave the area around the laundry
dryer since I stand around there a lot and lawn doesn't stand a
chance. Plus that way if I drop something it won't get all muddy.</p>
<p>We've got the vegetable garden going by the deck there, and I
expect it will stay there because that's one of the sunniest parts
of the yard, unless we give up on it altogether and just grow
food in the planters on the deck.</p>
<p>For the rest of the garden, I'm going for a low-maintenance,
woodland, bird- and butterfly-friendly mainly-native plant
vibe. The only specific plants I have in mind at the
moment are a Saskatoon berry plant for the birds, and something
evergreen for winter interest, of which I have none at the
moment. I'm finding it really hard to source native plants
but I suspect I just don't know where to look.  I need to 
keep researching them so that I have the names of native
plants in my head, so I recognise them when I see them. Most
garden centres and catalogues don't have any comment on whether
plants are native or not.</p>
<p>That's the plan. It's going to take a while to get there, but
at least I have some idea where I'm going so I'm no longer
paralysed by my garden. Onward!</p>

<p>I was given <strong><em>Love Monkey</em></strong> <strong>by Kyle Smith</strong> by 
<a href="http://inquisiturient.blogspot.com/2009/03/march-2009-books-and-movies.html">a friend</a> who hated it. Not sure what this says about my
friends, but I definitely didn't hate this book. It's
your typical 30-something single New Yorker looking for
love book, except the protagonist is a guy instead of
a chick. </p>
<p>Smith sets up his protagonist, Tom Farrell, as 
a dick—he's rude to his mother and he's a cartoon-watching,
cereal-for-dinner-eating 
man-boy—and then redeems him over the course of the book
with self-deprecating honesty and vulnerability,
and with the charming, witty conversations he has with his 
romantic interests, the almost-perfect Julia and the
reliable back-up date Bran.</p>
<p>I found it interesting to get into this
particular man's head. At first I was quite put off by
how self-conscious Farrell is and how he overanalyses
and manipulates situations to suit himself, but then
I realized that I do that too—we all do.
For example, I had some people over
yesterday, some of my coolest and brightest friends.
We all brought some books that we had enjoyed and
wanted to pass on, and did a big old book swap. One
of the women brought <em>She's Come Undone</em> by Wally
Lamb, and she reported that when she chose it her
husband questioned her choice: "Think of your
brand!" he said. We all made fun of that but I 
think we all know what he meant—you have this
image of yourself that you want to project to other
people, and it
isn't necessarily your whole, honest nitty-gritty
self. You second-guess your impulses, you
debate clothing choices, you carefully curate the 
items in your home. I will admit that the books
on display in my dining room are slightly cooler
and smarter (and prettier) than the books hidden 
upstairs.  Smith unflinchingly documents Farrell's 
management of his brand, which could make him seem 
like a manipulative phony, but his vulnerability and
honesty and wit won me over in the end.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Going Solo</em></strong> <strong>by Roald Dahl</strong> is the sequel to
Dahl's childhood memoir, <em>Boy</em>. <em>Going Solo</em> documents
Dahl's early twenties working for Shell in Tanzania, and in
the Royal Air Force fighting in Greece during
the German invasion. He talks about the people he met
in Africa, the bizarre adventures he had there, his
training as a pilot followed immediately by a
spectacular crash which sent him to hospital for
six months with a horrible head injury. Once he
recovered he was sent right back into the fray,
where he faced ridiculous odds against the German
invasion and was one of the last of the Allied forces
to flee Greece.</p>
<p>The only
slow spot in the book was when Dahl detailed apparently
every training flight he took. (I expect flying
the planes was more interesting than reading about
it.) The rest of the book was exciting and moving.
The best part was when Dahl encountered a
group of Jewish children and the man who was 
protecting them, hiding them in an obscure corner
of Greece. Like so many people, Dahl was oblivious
to the Holocaust and his bafflement about
the Jews' plight was curiously charming. </p>
<p>The disastrous loss of almost all the men he flew with was 
a reminder of the idiotic nature of war. 
I am both thankful that Dahl made
it through the war alive, and sickened by the thought
of the amazing talents that we will never know about
because they didn't.</p>
<p>I enjoyed <em>Going Solo</em> and would recommend it particularly
to boys, although I don't know what age. (I picked it up
at the school library, so obviously someone thinks that kids
twelve or under would like it.) It's exciting
and captures what it was to be a gentleman and adventurer
in an earlier, but still fairly recent, time.</p>
<p>We read <strong><em>The Pillars of the Earth</em></strong> <strong> by Ken Follett</strong> in
Book Club. I gave it a 5, which is the second-lowest
rating I have given a book club book. My first exposure
to this book was back when it came out in '89; it was
panned horribly by a <em>Globe and Mail</em> reviewer and one
of the English teachers at my high school used the review
as an example of how to review a book negatively. I don't
recall if I read that review, but ever since high school
I've carried with me the idea that this is not a particularly
good book, and reading it didn't turn that impression around.</p>
<p>My two main problems with the book are that the writing is
clunky and awful, and that it has no particular Literary
Value—it's not clever. I did quite like
the characters, and the plot was exciting if a little
relentless towards the end. The book was 
well-researched and Follett certainly made sure to put
in plenty of historical detail so all that time doing research
didn't go to waste. I enjoyed all the information about
building and architecture, and I appreciate
Follett's attempts to describe complicated structures
without illustrations. I wish he had put a little more
effort into period-appropriate language; the book is 
thick with anachronistic words and usages. For
example, when writing from the point-of-view of a 
female character he refers to menstruation as having
a period, a usage which didn't appear until the 1800s.
The book would have been richer and more engaging
if the language hadn't seemed so modern.  </p>
<p>In the end <em>The Pillars of the Earth</em> didn't engross me.
I read on because I wanted to know what happened, but I
wasn't invested in the characters or absorbed into the 
action.</p>
<p><strong><em>Get a Freelance Life: mediabistro.com's Insider Guide to Freelance 
Writing</em></strong> <strong>by Margit Feury Ragland</strong> Yes, you see where
I'm going. I kind of hate how listing the books I've
read provides a kind of window into what I'm thinking 
about, but there doesn't seem to be any real point in
being secretive. </p>
<p>This is the second book I've read on writing as
a job, so you might suppose that I'm contemplating a
new career direction. Well, maybe I am. If I were this
would be a very helpful book, perhaps even one to buy
and keep around. It has plenty of advice on how to
launch your writing career, how to focus on a speciality,
how to do research, pitching ideas, the editing process
and all the many varieties of editor that can be found
in the wild, and much more besides. The book is aimed 
mainly at magazine and book writing, with only one chapter
about business writing.</p>
<p>I started reading <em>Make a REAL Living As A Freelance 
Writer: How to Win Top Writing Assignments</em> by Jenna Glatzer
but right at the beginning of the book she says something
about how you <em>could</em> make a living writing for businesses,
but would you rather tell your friends that your byline is
on an article in <em>People</em>, or that you wrote the piece of
junk mail they just tore up. Well, first off I'm not a
pathetic celebrity whore, and second not all business 
writing is junk mail. I don't even think I have any friends
who read <em>People</em>! (My problem with writing for magazines is
that I don't really read them: I read <em>Toronto Life</em>, 
<em>New Scientist</em>, <em>Today's Parent</em> and <em>Chirp</em>. I'd be 
happy to write for any of those publications, but a potential
market of four magazines is
hardly going to put bread on the table.)</p>
<p>Between that, the ALL-CAPS EMPHASIS in the title, and 
some snotty comment about how it's so unprofessional 
to have children crying in the background
when you're on a business call (because God forbid you
should want to <em>earn a living</em> after having <em>reproduced</em>)
and I just gave up on this book. If I ever develop a 
burning desire to write in magazines for fame and fortune,
I will know where to look for advice.</p>
<p><strong><em>Your Five- and Six-Year-Old</em></strong> <strong>by the editors of Parents magazine</strong>.
Delphine has gone all weird and cranky lately, so I sought
out books about six-year-olds to see if it's a Thing, and
apparently it's a Thing. Six-year-olds are all neurotic
because they're trying to detach from their parents and become
independent but
at the same time they totally adore us, so that creates this
horrible inner conflict which causes them to be psychotic bitches
half the time and completely adorable, enthusiastic
sweethearts the rest of it. It's exhausting. It's
funny how before you have kids everyone tells you about
the Terrible Twos, but they don't mention the Fucking
Fours or the Psycho Sixes. Two was easy, dude. At least
Two doesn't tell you she hates you.</p>
<p>This was a helpful book, nice and pragmatic. Lots of stuff
about praise, which is kind of anti-Kohn, but then apparently
six-year-olds eat up praise and so much of parenting a
six-year-old is about easing them through this horrible
stage (they're not enjoying it any more than you are) so 
maybe a little judicious praise, or at least unbridled
adoration, would go a long way.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Fine Art of Copyediting</em></strong> <strong>by Elsie Myers Stainton</strong>
When I mentioned to <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/">Greg Wilson</a> that
I was pondering a writing career he suggested I consider 
editing as well, so I got a couple of copyediting books
out of the library. If you imagine that a book about copyediting
would be quite boring, you'd be right. I think this book
is probably as exciting as a copyediting book could be, and
it was still pretty dry. Stainton does a great job giving
an overview of the copyeditor's job, as well as providing
plenty of concrete reference material such as editor's marks
and grammatical rules. The best part, though, is her 
defense of the art of copyediting, of the importance of it
and the satisfaction of being part of the 
intellectual discourse. </p>
<p>I learned some things about 
editing which I didn't know: I didn't realize that editors
are responsible for identifying poor reasoning and flawed
arguments, nor did I realize that they are supposed to 
identify racist and sexist language. It's not just 
grammatical nitpicking! (It's other kinds of nitpicking too!)
That made me much more interested
in copyediting, although I'm not sure I am detail-oriented
enough to be a good copyeditor. It's worth
contemplating further.</p>

<p>Delphine's birthday was better than her party, although
still a weird day. For one thing, it's Mother's Day so
she had to share her special day with me.  And after
breakfast, Cordelia came down with that same miserable
puking sickness Delphine just recovered from. But before
the major puking set in, Delphine managed to open a truly
impressive haul of presents. I love buying things for her, and
I don't indulge throughout the year, so birthdays and 
Christmas are OTT.</p>
<p>She got a million books, some science magazines, a prism
to hang in her window, some hairbands, a bunch of super cute
summer clothes from Baba, games from friends, wind chimes,
a badminton set, some stationery, and her very own metal
water bottle to take to school. I managed to get her a
whole bunch of stuff without adding to the existing quantities
of junk in her room: no new dolls, no new buddies, no new
Playmobil or little toys which are hard to put away. More
books, but she still has plenty of feet of empty bookshelf
space to fill before that becomes a problem.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was pretty low key. Blake and I
spelled off lying on the couch with Cordelia and hanging
out with Delphine; he played badminton, I helped her
paint her wind chime. Later Baba and Zaida took her out
for a swim, while Blake and I took turns napping with
Cordelia. I took the first shift, and woke up in one 
of those completely confused hazes. A cup of tea cured
that, and I commenced making Delphine's birthday cake.
I did a crazy food colouring rainbow cake; three layers
of cake (purple, green and orange) separated by three
layers of icing (blue, yellow and red). Considering I
started it so late in the day and I've never made a
cake like that it turned out pretty well. (Pictures were
taken and will eventually appear.)</p>
<p>Delphine didn't eat much of her birthday dinner; her
appetite still hasn't recovered since she was sick.
But she had a nice time with her family and she liked
her presents (hooray!). This might not have been the
best birthday ever, but it was still a good one.</p>

<p>Today was Delphine's last day of being five, and also the day
of her birthday party. There almost was no party; Delphine has
been laid low with some kind of puking and fatigue disease.
She stayed home from school on Friday and I warned the
party invitees that the party may be off. This morning
Delphine woke up feeling better, so I made a bunch of calls to
summon the troops.  One of the kids had already changed her 
plans, so in fact
of Delphine's original list of six, only three children
were able to come. (Two of her list had previously declined.)</p>
<p>The weather wasn't conducive to small-child-partying. There
were intermittent thunderstorms all day, which meant all our
fun outside games were transferred inside, smaller and darker
and less fun. </p>
<p>I don't know if the children enjoyed themselves; they 
certainly aren't shy about letting you know when they're
not having fun, when they don't like a game, when they 
don't like any of the food, when someone isn't playing the
way they want you to, or indeed when anything isn't rocking
their little worlds. But nobody screamed and demanded to be
sent home, so I suppose that's a win. You might guess
I didn't particularly enjoy hosting today's party.</p>
<p>Delphine didn't have a great day either. It started
with still being a little bit sick, complicated by bad
weather, missing friends, and a party that didn't go as
smoothly as she wanted it to - Cordelia didn't play 
the games properly and nobody listened to her. By this 
afternoon she didn't
like any of her presents and nobody loved her, and by 7:15 pm
she was begging to go to bed. Tomorrow is her birthday
and I hope it goes better.</p>
<p>(It's now 9:47 pm, and Delphine is crying in her room. Blake
went upstairs to comfort her, and I just heard her say, 
"I want chicken!" Turns out she wanted Chicken her buddy,
not chicken the food.)</p>

<p>I've been thinking some more about Guides. There's a lot
more to it than I first thought.  The problems
I wrote about yesterday, with the badges and the structure,
those are problems of unmet potential. Guides
could be a fantastically cool opportunity for girls
to explore their interests and challenge themselves, but 
in fact it's a leader-centred crafts-and-activities club.
Some of the crafts and activities are cool, some of them
are pretty lame, but they're seldom actively damaging.
(Although I wish Delphine's troop hadn't chosen to
do a <em>bridal shower</em> for a leader in one of
the meetings.)</p>
<p>But failed potential is only that; it doesn't mean Sparks
has no value. It's an all-girl group of friends separate
from Delphine's school friends, which is important. It's
good for kids to have more than one group of friends; if
one group goes wrong with bitchiness or drama, you have
other friends to fall back on. And it's valuable
for kids of either gender to spend significant amounts
of time in same-sex groups.  On both those counts,
Sparks stacks up in a way that I don't think will be
easy to find elsewhere.</p>
<p>The other nice thing about Sparks/Brownies/Guides is
that it taps into the Guiding infrastructure. They
have programs, they have funding, they have summer
camps and campsites. (Sparks don't go camping, but Brownies
do.) Camping with Brownies and Guides was my first 
exposure to real camping, and it had a lasting impact
on me as it did on Kat.</p>
<p>Guides is also an organization with a rich history, 
and it's represented throughout the world. When I was a kid
I remember thinking it was pretty cool that there were
Girl Guides just like me in places like India and 
Australia.</p>
<p>I've tried, largely in vain, to find other clubs or 
organizations which would fit the bill: a (preferably)
girls-only organization which will provide community
and allow my girls to explore their interests and
challenge themselves in a supportive, pedagogically 
progressive environment.  In the States
they have Earth Scouts and Camp Fire Boys and Girls, which seem
to be much more sciency, and more child-centred, than
Guides. Camp Fire Boys and Girls is 
US only. The Earth Scouts website is pretty horrifying
and they do that stupid badge thing too. (Maybe my standards
are too high.) I've thought about seeing if the ROM
or the OSC have any kind of generic Science or
Discovery clubs, but they wouldn't provide that 
continuity of community that I'm hoping for. I've
even thought about starting something up myself, but
I don't care about this enough to invest that kind
of time and effort into it. (Not that I don't care
very much, but it would be a <em>lot</em> of time and effort.)</p>
<p>In conclusion, Sparks seems to be the best of a bad
lot of options. Is that good enough? I'm still thinking
about it.</p>
