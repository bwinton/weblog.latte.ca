<p>Back in March of 1999, I started working at a small software
company downtown. I got there about a week before their 
network administrator quit, to be replaced by a quiet guy named
Jeff. Jeff was an agreeable fellow who would listen
patiently when I wandered into his office to talk his ear off
about last night's TV or the latest movie I'd seen. It soon
became apparent that Jeff had a formidable memory for facts
and details; he could identify obscure actors, recall
chemical names and properties from his grad school days, and
could reel off all kinds of sports minutiae which still don't
mean anything to me.  You could talk to Jeff about just about
anything—food, science, sports, celebrity gossip—and 
he would be able to hold up his side of the conversation.</p>
<p>Jeff soon became my number one work buddy, my go-to guy whenever
I needed a break from my computer and wanted a chat, my
faithful lunchtime companion, my reference for all things
operating system-y, my fellow sufferer of workplace bullshit. 
Once we skipped out of work for the afternoon to see <em>The 
Perfect Storm</em>.</p>
<p>A year or so after I met Jeff, I started taking singing lessons.
The girl whose lesson came after mine was named Kathryn; our
music teacher introduced us once, but I didn't pay much attention
because I'm a lazy cuss with limited social skills. My laziness
came back to haunt me when a few weeks later a pretty, animated
girl walked up to me in choir practice. "Hi, Amy!"</p>
<p>Blank stare.</p>
<p>"It's Kathryn! From singing lessons?"</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. I'm a dork.</p>
<p>Fortunately <a href="http://inquisiturient.blogspot.com/">Kathryn</a> forgave 
me and we became fast friends. One
day I invited some friends from work, and Kathryn, over to play
Trivial Pursuit, eat pizza and drink beer. Jeff, as usual, kicked
our asses in Trivial Pursuit because he never forgets anything
he's ever learned. Kat was struck by the breadth of his knowledge
and also his unassuming, agreeable manner. She decided he would
be a perfect match for her little sister Colleen, herself a
games nut and formidable repository of trivia.</p>
<p>But first we had to wait for Colleen to break up with her boyfriend
at the time. Then we had to try and get the two of them together
in the same room. That took a couple of years. Finally in September
of 2007, they were both invited to our deck party, Colleen 
with specific, illustrated instructions
to seek out and interact with Jeff. Sure enough the pair of them
hit it off and chatted all night. Kat and I nudged
them together over the next couple of days, and...</p>
<p>Yesterday they were married.</p>
<p>The ceremony was at U of T's Miller Lash house in Scarborough. It was
short, sweet and sunshiney (most of the female guests
seem to have gone home with the sunburn booby prize, myself
included). There followed a long break for lunch, during which Blake and
I came back into the city to drop the girls off with Baba and
Zaida, and (in my case at least) take a nap. Refreshed, I trowelled
on some spackle (I mean makeup), wired my underwear and outerwear
together, glued my hair in place, wrestled with some strappy
sandals, and thanked God I don't have to
look like a girl every day. Finally Blake and I caught the #54
bus and rode it all the way to the end of the line, for the 
reception at the
East Rouge Community Centre. "Community Centre" conjures up
images of sweaty basketball courts and ice rinks, but this is 
actually a very classy venue, an elegantly casual, good-sized hall 
with a balcony and a fireplace.</p>
<p>This might sound a little bit lame, but I was really excited to
go to this wedding reception. Between being a stay-at-home mum
and economising, we never go out for a fancy dinner, and I haven't
gone dancing since Delphine was born. The idea of a nice dinner
with tablecloths and wine and interesting company, followed by
dancing, was pretty thrilling. Fortunately (considering the commute)
the night more than lived up to my expectations. </p>
<p>Dinner was served buffet-style, with chicken stuffed with goat cheese
and peppers, and grilled sirloin with caramelized onions and a selection
of sauces, grilled polenta, orzo salad, caesar salad, and little potatoes.
For dessert there were butter tarts, lemon tarts, meringues with lemon
custard, brownies, homemade Italian cookies, and berries and whipped 
cream. Oh, and wedding cake after that! Gastronomic bliss, and my
wine glass was never empty.</p>
<p>After a few short but heartfelt speeches, there was great music for
dancing. Blake doesn't dance, and at first I was too self-conscious
to dance "by myself", but soon enough I was dancing with a bunch
of girls and having an awesome time.</p>
<p>But enough about what a great time <em>I</em> had last night—it's 
wonderful to see Jeff get married, and it's gravy (for me—what?
It's <em>my</em> weblog!) that he married someone I'm connected to in
another way. Because Kat and I are so close, and I'm so fond of
Jeff, I feel like this marriage has created 
a circle of connections which somehow vaguely includes me.
I hope Colleen and Jeff are happy together forever, and
I hope they (and Kat) stay a part of my life for just as long.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make. For the last few months, I have
seriously worried that I might like one of my children more
than the other. On the one hand I had Delphine, irritable,
emotional, and bossy; on the other, I had Cordelia, amiable,
charming and fun. (Also little and cute.) Obviously I love them 
both, but Cordelia was a lot easier to be around than Delphine. </p>
<p>And then Cordelia changed. She's still funny and cute (and little), 
but she's gone all intense. She's at that age now, where if
you cut her toast wrong, or put the applesauce on top
of the yoghurt, or put the left shoe on before the right, she
freaks out, sobbing until whatever it is is put right or you
manage to make her laugh. The other night she didn't want to go
to bed, and she had a stereotypical toddler tantrum, screaming
and kicking and yelling, for a good ten minutes. We had honestly
never had one of those, with either Cordelia or Delphine.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this change in behaviour is a developmental
stage, or if it's simple that we gave up naps a week or so ago
and she's still adjusting. Before this she'd always been a happy,
easy-going baby, but I remember Delphine going from 
Straightforward to Complicated sometime in the preschool years.
Parenting a baby and toddler is a physical endeavour, carrying 
and feeding and wiping. Parenting a child is emotional 
and mental and completely different. I think I now have two
children.</p>
<p>Thank goodness—I don't think I could have pretended
they were both equally easy and fun for much longer.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, as you might remember, Blake biked from
Toronto to Balm Beach on Georgian Bay, a 135K ride preceded by
several long training rides. He got all fit that summer, and
seemed to have fun (mostly), so I proposed that we do something
similar this summer: plan a nice long ride, do some longish
training rides, spend some time together and get fit.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Blake, Kat and I did one 44K training ride, and then 
we biked to Oakville. (It's way too hard to schedule rides for
three people and a babysitter.) We picked Oakville because it 
is the right distance—a
100 K round trip—and because it's nice. Kat's been there
a few times so she knows the lay of the land.</p>
<p>The day started early—our babysitter arrived, Tim's in hand,
at 7:50 am, and Blake and I got on our bikes and headed down Mount
Pleasant to meet Yonge Street somewhere south of St. Clair. We
tried to leave Yonge a couple of times, but with Bay Street on 
one side and the Pride parade on the other, we didn't have a lot
of options. It was fun blowing through downtown first thing on a
Sunday, and before we knew it we were at our rendezvous point at 
King. Kat joined us and we made for the waterfront.</p>
<p>Our route took us west on Queen's Quay to the Waterfront Trail, past 
harbours and beaches and coves and rocky bits and all kinds of
watery goodness. We stopped at the beautiful Humber Pedestrian 
Bridge for a photo op and some energy bars, then blew past the
Butterfly Garden in Mimico, making a note to stop there on the
way home.</p>
<p>Soon after that the rain started. It wasn't a drizzle, making us
moist and warm. It wasn't a driving rain, lashing into our faces.
It was merely large raindrops, plenty of them, falling straight down.
Not ill-mannered rain, but very insistent, very wet, very rainy
rain. We were soon soaked.</p>
<p>We carried on, through Etobicoke and into Mississauga. We were still
on the Waterfront Trail, which at that point alternated between 
on-road routes (with some great real estate and gardens to ogle, especially
on the water side) and a wide paved trail travelling beside the water
through parks and woods. For a while we leapfrogged with a
pair of athletic dads (I could tell they were athletic because
they were wearing technical biking gear) pulling their kids
in trailers, but they left us near the edge of Mississauga, saying,
"It's all sidewalks from here on".</p>
<p>They were right about that. The Mississauga/Oakville border bit
of the Waterfront Trail is mainly oversized sidewalks beside busy
streets, with a rather surreal detour through an industrial area
("Trucks crossing") and directly beside a complicated, strangely 
beautiful Petro-Canada plant.</p>
<p>Eventually the actual trail—well, the overgrown 
sidewalks—ran out and we had to bike through
the curvy, monotonous streets of suburbia.  The houses got
farther apart, the streets lacked sidewalks, the... oh, don't
make me go all Kunstler on you. Finally Mississauga ended and
Oakville began, to much rejoicing by Kat. (I don't know that
anyone has ever been that happy to get to Oakville. I was
just wet. Did I mention it was still raining?)</p>
<p>Oakville's contribution to the Waterfront Trail does not appear
to go anywhere near the waterfront. It consists of narrow
sidewalks, signposted alternately with forbidding notices
informing you that Oakville frowns on bike riding on sidewalks,
and friendly green signs with bike icons on them, running
beside giant houses on vast acreages.  You can't ogle the 
houses, though, because they're walled in. I did get a 
look at a couple
of greenhouses. Occasionally the sidewalk ends, to be replaced
by a grit path, intersected by driveways used by people who
don't look out for you because no-one has ever been mad enough to bike
this way before. As we biked I nursed my hatred for rich people.</p>
<p>If you persevere on this path beyond all sense and reason, eventually
you will get to "downtown" Oakville, which is a lot like Bayview
and Davisville.  That's a hell of a long way to travel for someplace 
just like home, but there's modern life for you. </p>
<p>We locked up our bikes and searched for a restaurant sufficiently 
casual that the entrance of three grubby, soaked cyclists
wouldn't put everyone off their lunch. We ended up at a
sandwich cafe where we ate good sandwiches,
mediocre soup, and disappointing desserts, while debating
our next move. </p>
<p>We were wet but not 
disheartened, but Blake and I were bored with biking through
suburbia and Oakville's shitty "bike path". Kat, whose thirst
for challenge apparently knows no bounds, wanted to bike 
the whole damn way back. Blake was having no fun, and wanted
to take the GO train all the way back. I was tempted to agree
with Blake but I could also sympathise with Kat's desire for a
more epic ride, to push ourselves a little more. I suggested
we use the GO train to skip the boring suburbs and land us back
in civili–, I mean, Toronto to bike home along the bits of the Waterfront
Trail that are actually within sight of water.</p>
<p>We raced to the Oakville GO station and made the 2:30 train,
wrestling our bikes onto inconveniently non-bike-accomodating
cars for the twenty-five minute ride to Mimico, where we
rejoined the trail along the water. It had stopped raining
while we were on the train, but obligingly started again
once we were back on our bikes. The ride back into town was
uneventful—we did slow down through the butterfly
garden but lacked the inclination to linger. By the time we got
to Bay Street our bums were all sore and we were exhausted.
Blake and I
took the TTC back up to Davisville and then enjoyed the short
ride home, although not as much as we enjoyed long, hot showers
and some quality couch time.</p>
<p>All in all it came to 67.5 K for Blake and I (7 K less for Kat 
because she didn't have to ride downtown), which is pretty
good but not quite epic. I'd like to try another couple
of long rides this summer, if we can find indulgent babysitters,
although I think I would rather take transit out to somewhere
interesting and bike from there, than have to bike through
the suburbs again.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, I looked at the maps after we got home and 
Port Credit is really where the Waterfront Trail stops being 
nice—we were being conservative when we came all the
way back to Mimico.)</p>

<p>I started working for <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com">Mozilla Messaging</a> a
while ago, and since <a href="http://blog.codekills.net/">David Wolever</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/wolever/status/2394705659">asked
me</a> how I used Mercurial and the
MQ extension, I thought I would put up some notes on how I’m currently using
them in my day-to-day work.  Of course, the stuff I’m doing now is a little
different than what I’ve done in any of my previous jobs, so I’m not sure how
useful any of the following will be to anyone who isn’t contributing to an open
source project.</p>
<p>First, let’s talk a little bit about how I have my Work directory set up.  The
first thing I did when I started working on the Thunderbird source code was to
pull down a clean copy of the source into a directory named “src-base”.  The
purpose of that directory is to always contain a clean copy of the upstream
source code so that when I want to update the various branches I have (five, at
last count), I only need to download the changes from the Mozilla repo once,
and I can then propagate them from src-base to the other branches.  I got the
idea to do that from the Bazaar-NG developers, and I think it has helped to
keep my bandwidth usage down.  It might cause a problem if I was sharing my
branches, but since Thunderbird seems to revolve around submitting patches to
bugzilla, it works out pretty well.</p>
<p>The next thing I did was to clone src-base into a directory named
“add-reply-list-button” (because I was writing a patch to add a Reply-To-List
button :), go into that directory, and type <tt>hg qinit -c</tt> to create an
mq repository, and put the mq repository itself under version control.  (I
didn’t actually do that the first time, and was quite annoyed that I couldn’t
revert changes I had made in my patch queue.)  The other part of that is that
I’ve aliased <tt>mq</tt> to <tt>hg -R $(hg root)/.hg/patches</tt>.  This lets
me type <tt>mq commit</tt> to commit the changes to the patch.</p>
<p>So, now we’re at my day-to-day work.  If I’m working on a bug that I’ve already
got a patch started for, I cd to the appropriate branch, type <tt>hg
qseries</tt> to see where I am, and <tt>hq qpush</tt> or <tt>hg qpop</tt> to
get to the patch I want to work on.  Then I make my changes, and when I’m happy
with the results of <tt>hg diff</tt>, I type <tt>hg qrefresh</tt> to put the
changes into the patch.  After that, I use <tt>hg qdiff &gt;
../branch-name-bugnum-description.diff</tt> to get a patch that I can upload to
bugzilla.  At this point, I usually load the patch into Vim, and search for
some of the mistakes I’ve made in the past.  (<tt>/^+.*[[:space:]]+$</tt>, and
<tt>/dump</tt> caught a lot of my initial mistakes.  Now I’ve moved on to
things that are tougher to check for, like putting open-parens on a new line
instead of on the previous line.)  I usually go through a couple of cycles of
<tt>hg qrefresh</tt>/<tt>hg qdiff …</tt> before I’m happy with the patch.  Once
I am, I type <tt>mq commit -m "Updated patch to fix foo and bar."</tt> to save
the state of the patch, and then I upload it.</p>

<p>Both the girls "graduated" last week, Delphine from Senior Kindergarten,
and Cordelia from Nursery School. There is some division
of opinion on these early graduations: Some people seem to think
they're idiotic—graduating from kindergarten?! Seriously?—while
others, mostly parents, think they're charming. I'm in the latter
camp: a rite of passage is a rite of passage, even if you're
only three feet tall. Both Cordelia's life and Delphine's are
going to be very different in September, and I think that's 
worth acknowledging.</p>
<p>Cordelia is starting Junior Kindergarten in fall, in the mornings.
We haven't met her teacher yet because she's going to be new
to the school, and I have no idea who else is going to be in 
her class. All we know is which room she's going to be in.
She's familiar with the school, though, from dropping off
and picking up Delphine for the last two years. She's thrilled
to be going to "my sister's school". (She refers to Delphine
almost exclusively as "my sister".)</p>
<p>Delphine is starting Grade One in fall, and we'll find out 
tomorrow who her teacher is going to be. She's alternately
scared and excited about Grade One. I'm excited about finally
being able to buy school supplies.</p>
<hr>
<p>Cordelia has a new passion: chewing gum. I always used to
judge, a teeny bit, people who let little kids chew
gum, but as in so many ways, I have become that which I 
judged. I have to limit her to one piece of gum a day. She
likes the minty kinds.</p>
<p>Delphine's new passion is <em>Dirty Jobs</em>, which she likes to
watch every day. I figure it's an informative window
into the grown-up world, and it will give her some idea of 
how much work goes into making the food and objects which
appear in our house. And into cleaning skulls and preparing
owl pellets. She calls Mike Rowe "Mark".</p>
<hr>
<p>Delphine and Cordelia were enjoying a marathon TV session
on Saturday morning, when <em>Saddle Club</em> came on. <em>Saddle Club</em>
is one of those cheap soap operas in which Australia seems
to specialise—this one is set at some kind of horsey school
and is aimed at, I assume, "tweens". Delphine doesn't watch
it regularly but she enjoys it when she catches it. I think it's
rubbish, and when it came on I huffed and rolled my eyes. 
Delphine said, "What?"</p>
<p>"I don't like this show. There's too much melodrama and people
getting upset with each other."</p>
<p>Blake cut in with, "They don't talk to each other about their
problems, they just get mad."</p>
<p>I said, "No-one acts like that in real life."</p>
<p>Delphine gazed at us levelly. "Maybe they just want to make it
exciting."</p>
<p>Well, I guess I don't need to worry about her media awareness.</p>
<hr>
<p>I went to Value Village today. (Blake stayed home and looked
after the children, so they don't appear in this story. Sorry.)
My mum sent me some money for my birthday, because I said I
wanted to buy myself some new clothes.  I thought the money would
go further if I shopped at VV instead of Addition-Elle or
Lands' End.</p>
<p>The trouble with living in a middle-class neighbourhood 
surrounded by more middle-class neighbourhoods
is that you have to travel a long way to get to a second-hand store.
My second-hand-shopping maven friend told me that the
Value Village at Landsdown is the best one, so off I trekked. A
bus trip (it was too hot to walk to the subway station) and
a long subway ride (with a transfer!) later, I arrived at Landsdown.
I can't comment on how nice the Landsdown area is, because it
was 30 degrees today and there's a municipal strike on; I 
imagine every Toronto neighbourhood looked like shit today.</p>
<p>The Value Village at Landsdown is huge, it's like a small
Zellers. I managed to find beautiful dresses for the girls to
wear to the two weddings we're invited to this summer, and then
I started shopping for myself.</p>
<p>How is it possible that I'm too fat to be a size 18 in the
dress section, but too thin to be a size 20? (Also why are there
so many ugly dresses? Did the <em>Golden Girls</em> Fan Club and
Drag Show recently clean out its closet?) Further, how is
it then possible that I can be too thin to be a size 18 in the
pants section? How is it possible that there was only one
cute dress that fit me, but dozens of sweaters and shirts? Do
fat women not buy cute dresses? Or do they buy them and then
hang on to them for dear life?</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing was how unevenly placed the sizes
were; I found clothes that fit me (and many more that didn't) 
in the size 16, size 18 
and size 20 sections. Some of those clothes had the original
store size labels on, and the VV staff had faithfully placed
the clothes in the section that matched the label. Which, of
course, is a failure. I'm an XL at Cotton Ginny, 
a L at Tabi, and a 1X at Addition-Elle, but I don't fit into
Reitman's XL, or really most other labels' XL. I'm a 16 pant 
at Lands' End and a 18 at Addition-Elle. So even if you
do place clothes in the label-appropriate section, you won't 
get consistency in section sizes.</p>
<p>VV has a chance to correct the vagaries of women's clothing 
sizes; surely it would be simple to have a template in the
back room against which staff could hold up each donated
item of clothing,
to sort it into the right bin. Even if you only picked one
dimension—waist for pants, say, and bust for 
dresses—once you found the size that matched your body, 
you would be one variable closer to finding something that fit.</p>
<p>This was only my second VV trip, and I think I've decided it
isn't worth it. It's a long trip to get there, it took me 
forever to find clothes to try on, I had to wait for a change
room, and then only about
fifteen percent of them fit. And after all that, of course, it's
another long way to come home again. If there were a location
nearer to here I might go again—they're opening some
new locations, but I fear we are too embedded in Richville to
ever get a thrift shop nearby.</p>
<p>After all that, I didn't even find a dress for myself to wear
to the weddings. Tomorrow I will call the local consignment
stores (without much hope) to see whether they carry my size.
I expect I will end up going to Addition-Elle, which is no
loss; I still have a good chunk of my birthday money left.
(That's the great thing about VV: two sweaters, three shirts,
one pair of pants, two pairs of earrings, a hat, and two 
kid's dresses for $70. Seriously!)</p>

<p>(I rewrote this entry to be shorter and hopefully more useful.)</p>
<p>I'm on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. I love 
Twitter—it's a fun way to stay connected, get 
the latest news, and to share ideas and news of my own.</p>
<p>Some of my friends have signed on to Twitter, tried it for
a couple of days, and never returned. I'm going to try and
explain how I use Twitter which makes it so fun and useful
for me, in the hope that people
will try it, or try it again. Because when it comes to
Twitter, the more the merrier!</p>
<p>Before I go on, I will quickly explain how Twitter works.
You probably already know it's a site where you can post
140 character messages. The messages can be read by anyone
who "follows" you.  </p>
<p>Your Twitter page also shows 
your "Twitter feed", which is a display of all the messages
("tweets") posted by people you follow. Note that
you don't have to follow the people who follow you, and the
people you follow don't have to follow you.</p>
<h5>Getting Started</h5>
<p>Signing up to Twitter is easy—the hardest part is
picking a good username. After you have signed in, fill 
in your Location and a short Bio, to make it easier for
people to find you and decide whether to follow you.</p>
<h5>Finding your Tweeps</h5>
<p>Once you're in, you need to follow some people. But who,
and how many? 
The real key to making Twitter work for you is balancing
the number of people you follow and the frequency with which
you check in. If you don't follow enough people, Twitter will
be boring and pointless and you'll lose interest. If you follow
too many people, your feed will be too busy and you won't be
able to keep up. </p>
<p>I'm going to throw out the number 75 as the minimum number of people you
should follow to keep things interesting. Of course, it will
depend how voluble your followees are, and how often
you can check in to Twitter. (I follow 225 people, and check in
four or five times a day, and I'm seldom either bored or
overwhelmed.)</p>
<p>Finding people to follow is the fun part. There are plenty of
ways to find people. You probably already know 
a few people who are on, so find out what their Twitter
usernames are and check out who they are following like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the person's Twitter page: http://www.twitter.com/username</li>
<li>On the right you'll see a number with "following" under 
  it—click on that number to see the list of people your
  friend follows.</li>
<li>Now you can click "follow" to follow anyone you like the look of.
  If you're not sure, you can click on any username to go to
  <em>their</em> Twitter page, which will show you all their tweets from
  latest to oldest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow anyone who looks interesting—it's really easy to 
unfollow people later. (When you follow someone they get an 
email notification, but when you unfollow them they don't.)</p>
<p>You can also find people using the "Find People"
option, at the top of the Twitter window. There, you can find 
people who are in your email contacts, or you can search for people
by name. </p>
<p>How do you decide who to follow? That's up to you; I look
for people who post interesting things about what they are
doing, and interesting links. Funny is good too.  I avoid 
people who only seem
to @reply to other people, and people who mainly RT (retweet). 
Interaction is nice but I like to read original thoughts too.  </p>
<p>You can also follow institutions and entities you
have a relationship with in real life, like 
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/starbucks">@starbucks</a> or 
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/globebooks">@globebooks</a>, and of
course a few celebrities are fun. I follow
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/SlashHudson">@SlashHudson</a>,
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/Jeffrey_Donovan">@Jeffrey_Donovan</a>,
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/donttrythis">@donttrythis</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Another interesting way to find people is 
<a href="http://www.tweetmondo.com">Tweetmondo</a>, a site which
lets you find Twitterers who live nearby. I found
a couple of people in my neighbourhood, and it's neat
to read their tweets about weather and local happenings.</p>
<h5>How Often To Twit</h5>
<p>Twitter works best for people who are online 
all the time, but you can still have fun with Twitter if you 
only get to your computer once or twice a day—you will 
just have to scroll down a few pages to catch up, or only
read the latest couple of pages and your @replies.</p>
<p>I don't think it would work to check Twitter less than once
a day, or maybe every couple of days at the very least. Twitter
is an of-the-moment medium and the more involved you are, 
the more you'll get out of it.</p>
<h5>About @replies</h5>
<p>One of the best things about Twitter is the @reply system. 
@replies are a way to directly address another
Twitter user. You put their username in your tweet,
with an @ sign before it. For example, if you want to
@reply me, include "@amyrhoda" in your tweet. Your tweet 
will be specially flagged for me to read when I log on.</p>
<p>You can also reply to a specific tweet by clicking
the little curly arrow which appears to the right of the tweet
when you mouse over it.</p>
<p>To read your @replies, click on @yourusername
on the right-hand column of the Twitter page. 
If you don't have much time to Twitter, you can always
check your @replies page to make sure you read and
respond to tweets addressed directly to you. </p>
<p>If you want to send a message to another user, but don't want
it to be public, start the message with "d username". This
will send them a Direct Message which can only be read by
that user. Read your Direct Messages by clicking on the
Direct Message link on the right column of your Twitter page.</p>
<h5>Following Back</h5>
<p>As I mentioned above, you will receive an email message
whenever someone follows you. Do you have to follow back 
everyone who follows you? No.  I tend to set the "should I
follow" bar a little lower for new followers, but I still
won't follow you if you're not a real person, if you don't
have any updates, or if you're unspeakably lame. Say.  </p>
<h5>Have Fun</h5>
<p>Some people take Twitter way too seriously. It's not
a popularity contest. It's not a major marketing tool. You're
not obliged to tweet, to retweet (repeat someone else's
tweet to pass it on to your followers), to @reply, to follow 
certain people, to participate in #followfriday, or anything
else. </p>
<p>Use Twitter however you like, however it works for you.
It's a great, fun way to connect with people. You just 
have to find the right set of Tweeters
to follow, and figure out the rhythm of Tweeting that works 
for you.</p>

<p>I just started making compost in my backyard, and because
I can't scratch my nose without intensive research,
I took a couple books out of the library.  Both named <em>Compost</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Compost</em></strong> <strong>by Ken Thompson</strong> is a glossy, beautifully 
produced little book published by the always-extravagant DK.
As well as being gorgeously designed and illustrated, it's
simple, to-the-point and includes everything you need to 
know to get started composting. It's thorough and scientific, yet
readable and above all, encouraging.</p>
<p><strong><em>Compost</em></strong> <strong>by Clare Foster</strong> covers about the same
material as the Thompson, but it's much dryer, preachier, and 
lacks the pretty pictures.</p>
<p>I also re-read <strong><em>Freakonomics</em></strong> <strong>by Steven D. Levitt and
Stephen J. Dubner</strong> for the non-fiction book club at the
library. (What is that book, like, four years old? It
would be nice to read something newer in the book club.)
It was good to reread this, especially
having read <em>Punished by Rewards</em> by Alfie Kohn which
addresses the issue of incentives. The Steves talk about
how everything can be explained by incentives, but then
give some examples which have clearly been disproven,
as shown in Kohn's book. That doesn't affect the 
plausibility of the Steves' arguments, though, because
despite talking about incentives in the introduction
they don't lean on them much throughout the book.</p>
<p>I liked this book the second time as much as I liked it
the first time. I relish the use of data to
understand the world in ways which are contrary to
popular wisdom, whether it's called economics or 
statistics or sociology.</p>

<p>Yesterday I got into a TwitFight. Not even a fight: There's
this guy on Twitter who posts the same advice every day. Literally,
the exact same Twit, every day. It's a "daily reminder". I
said to him, in a lighthearted way, that I would stop following 
him if he Twitted that again. One thing led to another and I
said I thought it was presumptuous to give out the same advice
every day (actually I said he was nagging), and he said it 
was presumptuous of me to assume he cares. Whatever. Tiny 
little disagreement about something of negligible importance 
with someone I don't know who means nothing to me.</p>
<p>How did I respond to this disagreement? Did I transfer my 
attention to something worthy of my time, maybe one of the
blogs I enjoy, or perhaps my children? My friends? No.
I let it get to me: my heart rate went up, I got nervous and
twitchy, I couldn't stop thinking about it.  I tried to talk
myself down, to get some perspective, to distract myself,
but my mind kept wandering back to the disagreement. I couldn't
stop thinking about it: was I wrong? Was the guy right? Should
I respond back to him? Would my friends back me up? Why was
he being a dick about it? <em>Was</em> he being a dick about it? Why
would he think that people want to read the same piece of advice
every day anyway? Should
I not have said anything? The thoughts kept buzzing around, 
almost beyond my control.</p>
<p>It's not just this time. The same thing happens whenever I get into
an altercation with anyone. It's been happening when I 
get into fights on the Internet
as long as I've been on the Internet, and it happens in
real life too, on the rare occasion when I have the balls
to disagree with someone who is within arm's reach. Any
fight, no matter how minor, results in hours of analysis
and worrying and anxiety. </p>
<p>I can't bear conflict.  I don't like 
people to disagree with me; when they do, I get defensive,
I get nervous, I second-guess myself. I try and get my
friends to take my side, or at least I reassure myself that
they would. I forget that I'm an
intelligent person who is entitled to disagree with others.
I forget that I don't need a bunch of people backing me up to be
right. I have a brain, I can have an opinion without taking a
poll of all my friends first. </p>
<p>Why do I have such a strong physical and emotional
reaction when I get into an argument with someone? Is it
just lack of practice? Is it some relic from my childhood?
Perhaps the more important question is, how do I get
over it? Maybe I need to pick more fights so that I 
learn to deal better.</p>

<p>The end of the school year draws near and everything is
starting to ease off. First, choir ended, freeing up my Monday
nights. Then Delphine's Sparks year ended, then Music Together.
Now all that's left is school: Cordelia has two 
weeks and Delphine has three. They both have "graduation" 
ceremonies, Cordelia's to celebrate the end of Nursery School
and advancement to Kindergarten, and Delphine's to celebrate the
end of Kindergarten and advancement to Grade One. Fall 2009
is going to be huge around here.</p>
<p>Cordelia is invited to visit her new kindergarten teacher
and see her next classroom the Wednesday after next. As
you can imagine, she's beside herself with excitement
to be going to the same school as her adored big sister.
(And yes, they do adore each other, as we discovered this
weekend when Delphine was away overnight and Cordelia kept
asking when she would be home.)</p>
<p>The excitement begins anew the week after school's out:
the girls are signed up for two weeks of swimming lessons,
every morning for half-an-hour. Then we have one 
honest-to-goodness week off before Delphine has a week of
all day camp downtown. The following Tuesday we're off 
to Sask to spend two weeks with Granny, who the girls adore.</p>
<p>No sooner are we back from Sask than the girls go
to the cottage with Baba and Zaida for a few days. It's a
small cottage so Blake and I aren't invited this year, which
is fine. I like the cottage fine but it's not a must-do.
(It just occurred to me that this will be the first time 
Blake and I have been away from the girls for more than 
a night. Whatever will we do?)</p>
<p>The following week, both girls are in a day camp nearby for a
week, and then we have two more weeks off before school
starts again. This summer is the opposite of last summer's
unscheduled bliss. We'll have to see which is better. I think
I might have overdone it with the camps and stuff this
year, but it might turn out to be just right.</p>

<p>Delphine has a loose tooth! There are a couple of girls
in her class who have lost lots of teeth, dozens and dozens 
of them.  One of the girls started losing teeth in JK! So of course
Delphine is miffed that she hasn't lost any yet. I've been
periodically checking her teeth to see if they're loose, and
today one on the bottom middle was a little bit wiggly.
(It might even be the first tooth that came in.) She was
beside herself with excitement. </p>
<p>The bad news is, I asked online
how long it takes one of these things to come out once
they start wiggling, and apparently it's one to four months.
Four months! She might be in Grade One before this tooth
finally comes out. It will give me time to get used to the
idea of her beautiful tiny white baby teeth being
replaced by those disproportionate tombstones little kids
are stuck with.</p>
<hr>
<p>Blake got a job. Well, kind of. He got a four month, full-time
contract. With Mozilla—cool. Unfortunately it doesn't
come with an office. We've been trying to figure out what he's
going to do with himself in order to get eight working hours
in every day—since he got laid off he's been consistently
doing contract work, but never eight hours a day, so he's been
able to hang around the house and get distracted by us without
falling too far behind.</p>
<p>He has an open invitation to work at U of T, but that's a 
significant commute, and I'm not sure whether the undergrads 
are more or less distracting than me and the girls.  There's 
two hours of free wi-fi at Starbucks, which is where I would
go every morning. There's the library—I
would go to the library, too, but I don't know if that
would work for Blake.</p>
<p>Incidentally, in addition to this full-time contract, Blake
still has two other contract jobs on the go, so I might not
be seeing much of him for the next little while. Hopefully he
can get lots of work done when the girls and I are in Sask.</p>
<hr>
<p>I think that's all, apart from that I planted some Irish moss and 
creeping jenny in the front yard between the neighbour's yard
and our path. I'm not sure how well it's going to do, but the
neighbours two doors down have some creeping jenny which is 
thriving, so I expect it will be okay. Provided I water
it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Oh, I forgot to mention in my last post that Delphine and
my conversation about World Wars ended with a rousing chorus
of "Sniper, no sniping!"</p>
