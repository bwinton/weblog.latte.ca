<p>Cordelia is four! Her birthday was on Sunday, and we celebrated
all day. In the morning, we had two kinds of pancakes (thin and
fat), and then we went out to Word on the Street for some literary
fun. We saw the TVOKids folks (again), got some (more) TVOKids swag,
had lunch (chicken and hot dog), visited the <em>This</em> and <em>Spacing</em>
magazine booths, bought some TTC station buttons from Spacing (Davisville,
Museum, Dupont and Dundas), and listened to stories. Then we
visited Daddy and his geeky friends at U of T. We all rode the
TTC home, and then lots of people came over for Cordelia's
birthday tea.</p>
<p>Instead of having a kid party for Cordelia, I invited family
and friends: Baba and Zaida, Morgan and Erik, Douglas and 
Tanya and Ursa and Otis, Sara and Blair and (more importantly)
Henry and Liam, and Kat. If you do that math you'll see I didn't
do myself any favours; we ended up with thirteen 
people over, but everyone managed to get themselves tea or
coffee or beer, and we didn't run out of cake, so I call that
a win.</p>
<p>For her birthday, Cordelia got a Schylling balloon mobile and
glow in the dark stars to decorate her bedroom, some cool
markers and a sticker book, a book of foam shapes, and Lauren
Child's creepy interpretation of 
<em>Goldilocks and the Three Bears</em>.  Those were all from me (bought with money from my mum. Hooray
Mum!)
She also got a jewellery-making kit and a sticker book from 
Henry, and a very cute
outfit from Kat, but the pièce de résistance was
a homemade robot outfit from Tanya and Ursa. Cordelia loves
to play robot: "I am a ro-obot!". I will post a picture.</p>
<hr>
<p>Cordelia isn't as independent as I remember Delphine being at
four.  In fact, she's very needy: she doesn't
like to do things for herself if she thinks there is any
way she can get you to do them, and she often pretends something
is too hard when I know she can manage it.</p>
<p>She's also clingy, but not in a fearful way. She doesn't cry when
we're separated, but she's very happy to see me when we reunite.
She seems to 
prefer my company to anything else. I said to another 
mom today, "No-one loves me as much as Cordelia does." 
I haven't re-read the Four book so I don't know if this
is expected behaviour. As I said, I don't remember it with Delphine,
but then we spent the four months after she turned four together,
so maybe it simply didn't come up.</p>
<hr>
<p>The other day Cordelia and I went to the school to pick Delphine
up after school. Cordelia was very excited to see one of her
classmates, Zoe, in the schoolyard. She ran after Zoe, but
the other girl didn't see her. Cordelia came back to me, disappointed.
"She didn't even see me!" I told her to try again, so she ran up
again, and again Zoe was walking away as Cordelia approached and
so didn't notice her. Once again I encouraged her to try again, so
she ran up to Zoe and planted
herself in front of her with a giant grin, kind of a "Boo!" move.
Zoe just stared at her, and turned away. And my heart cracked.</p>
<p>That's the kind of approach that would work great on a Baba
or Zaida or grown-up friend, so maybe she just needs to figure
out some approaches for people her own age who aren't won over
by extreme cuteness.
We've been (mildly) concerned about Cordelia's social skills 
for a while—she didn't play with other kids 
much at nursery school, but was
happy playing by herself. I'm not sure (again) what a four-year-old is
expected to manage, socially. I will talk to her teacher about it
in a few weeks after she's had a chance to get to know the kids 
better.</p>
<hr>
<p>Cordelia is delightful. She is almost always happy (although
sometimes she is very angry), she is agreeable, she is voluble,
she is clever. She likes to make things, arrange things, draw
and colour. She can run very fast. She knows the whole alphabet.
She still says "f" for "th", and "naybe" for "maybe". She likes
silly things: silly noises, silly pictures, silly stories. Cordelia
is a ray of sunshine.</p>
<hr>
<p>(Here's <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/delphine/four.html">my post about Delphine's fourth birthday</a> for fun. Cordelia chose lemon icing for her cake,
too!)</p>

<p>I'm a writer. I can tell I'm a writer because I write. This blog,
mainly; I've been blogging since 
<a href="http://arbrown.latte.ca/journal/archives/">before it was called blogging</a>.
But blogging doesn't pay the bills (except for some people) and
if I am going to be a professional writer I have to improve.
Fortunately the blog provides the perfect place for me to 
practice.</p>
<p>I won't be modest: I'm a pretty good writer. I can turn a sprightly
phrase, I have a good vocabulary, I can make myself understood.
To some extent that comes naturally, but not entirely: I work on word
choice, and I excise cliches when I notice them, but it's easy,
and fun. What I don't do is plan the structure of what I write,
neither at the article (essay? post? paper?) level nor at the
paragraph level. I also don't revise deeply: when I write a blog
post my revision consists of reading it once or twice to smooth out any
egregious bumps.</p>
<p>In the interest of writing better, I'm reading a handful of
books about writing, and the first one is called <em>Ideas and
Details: A Guide to Writing for Canadians</em> by M. Garret Bauman
and Clifford Werier. It's targeted at a university audience, 
people who have to write papers on things, but it seems to me
that their advice is valuable for any writer. What I am concentrating
on at the moment is their advice on structure and revision.</p>
<p>What they say about structure is the same old stuff we learned
in Grade Seven (and Eight, Nine, Ten,...): figure out what
you're trying to say (your thesis) and make sure your whole
paper supports that.</p>
<p>You've already seen my first Real Writing Project: it's 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/everythingelse/regretDad.html">that post about my dad</a> I put up on Monday. I knew I wanted to write "something
about my dad", but you and I both know that "something about
my dad" is not a thesis. I charged ahead with writing it anyway,
and what I got was a bunch of disjoint paragraphs: about
how my dad and I are alike, about our relationship, about
the relationship we didn't have, about seeing my dad in 
the nursing home, about how I felt the day he died. I
couldn't make it make sense. In the past I would have just
cleaned up the grammar and spelling and posted it like
that, but this time I decided to work
with it and try and make it into something less amorphous.</p>
<p>I wrote down a brief description of each paragraph, cut them
up and shuffled them around to see if I could see some 
unifying idea. I brainstormed some thesis ideas and
narrowed it down to two: 1) grieving for someone with dementia
can start long before they die, or 2) I mourn more for the
relationship I didn't have with my dad than that I did.
Obviously I went with Door #2. I think Door #1 is interesting
and worth writing about, but most of the stuff I had already
written was about my (non-)relationship with Dad, and that was
what has been on my mind (for the last, oh, five years).</p>
<p>I rearranged my little paragraph slips of paper until I 
liked the flow, and then I rearranged what I had written
on the computer. I had to write some new stuff and throw out
some of the stuff which didn't work with my new thesis (I
was sorry to cut some of it because I was happy with the
writing, so I saved it to a "snippets" folder for when I write
more about my Dad).</p>
<p>Then I revised, more carefully than usual. <em>Ideas and Details</em>
wants you to revise five times:</p>
<ol>
<li>For ideas. Make sure you thesis still fits the paper.</li>
<li>For details. Add and sharpen details.</li>
<li>For paragraph structure. Is each paragraph about one idea?</li>
<li>For word use. Conciseness, vivid verbs, metaphors, precise word choice.</li>
<li>For spelling and grammar.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of those, 1 scares me the most. Once I come up with a thesis
I'm very committed to it and I hate the idea of making a big
left turn when I've already written something. But if your
paper doesn't match your thesis or your thesis turns out to 
be rubbish, your whole paper is rubbish. (Hopefully you've
already noticed that before you get to the end of the first
draft, though.) Anyway, since I had already rearranged and
rewritten my post with the thesis in mind, I didn't have
any problem with this step or the next.</p>
<p>I have never paid attention to 3 before. I have pretty good
instincts as a writer (from reading so much, I suppose) and
my paragraphs are usually naturally well-structured, but
now that I'm a Real Writer I can't rely on instincts and
nature, so I went over the post to make sure each paragraph
had one idea and some supporting details.</p>
<p>Obviously 4 is my favourite revision step, and I had to stop
myself from fiddling with words in every other revision step.
5 I didn't do properly (as you can see—I missed a word
and only noticed it today). I tend to rely on my natural
grammar and spelling talents and very seldom look things up.
Well, I look up spelling; I never look up grammar and
punctuation, as you might have noticed.</p>
<p>And that post is what I ended up with. I found that after all
that work on structure and paragraphs I was quite unhappy
with the whole thing; I felt it was stiff and didn't flow.
I posted it anyway, and on rereading it today it's not as
bad as I thought it was. I think I'm just not used to working
so hard on what I write. I suspect every writer hates everything
they write at some point in the process.</p>
<p>So that was the post-mortem of my First Real Writing Project.
Writing this post (which I didn't structure or revise, incidentally,
so you won't have to read a post about how I wrote <em>this</em>
post) has served as an excellent distraction from the business
of working on a real, pitchable article or pursuing business
writing leads. Result!</p>

<p>I am like my dad—the older I get the more I see it. 
When I was a kid I thought I didn't have a 
sense of humour, because I didn't laugh at the same things my
mum laughs at. It took me a long time to realize that my
sense of humour is sarcastic and ironic, like my dad's.
(My mum always said my dad didn't have a sense of
humour, either.) I'm like him in other ways, too: we shared
a love of singing, of writing. We shared our insecurity,
our sociability, our interest in politics and civic engagement. </p>
<p>Despite our similarities, we never had a great relationship. 
My parents
had an awkward marriage, and since I was closer to my mother,
my childhood relationship with my father was strained by my 
knowledge of the hurt he caused her. After I left home, that
distance persisted, even when we travelled together.
There were glimmers of the connection we could have had.
Occasionally we would get talking about politics or people,
I would make a joke or sarcastic comment and the 
phone line would crackle with his rare laughter, stiff with
disuse. But soon we would run out of things to say and
the moment would pass. I never knew how to conjure up
those moments, or I didn't try very hard to.
Despite my best intentions, I could never shake off the childish 
embarassment and awkwardness I felt around him. When I got married my
dad sent me an angry letter about having the wedding in Toronto
rather than in Saskatchewan, and our
relationship never recovered.  As the years passed we talked
less and less, and only 
the topic of choral singing animated our strained conversations.</p>
<p>My dad was fifty-four when I was born, and eighty-seven
when he died.  Maybe if our lives had overlapped more,
I would grown up enough to connect with him as an adult. 
But before that happened, my dad's mind started to fade.
A few years ago I was going through some old family pictures
with him—he misidentified several 
children in pictures clearly taken in the seventies, as people born 
in the forties. That was my first hint that he was starting to
lose his mind. Later he fell victim to numerous scams of the
kind targeted at the elderly. He grew distant and vague.
Lying awake one night I realized
that he was only going to get worse, that I had
missed my chance have a good relationship with him. We
had passed the point of no return. That was the night I
started grieving for my dad.</p>
<p>A couple of years later, my mum and my dad's
doctors decided to move him into a nursing home—his
forgetfulness and inability to take care of himself were
taking a toll on my mum. A year after he moved
into the home, almost to the day, he died.  I got the call 
from my mum early in the morning of September 16, 2008. </p>
<p>My dad and I could have been great friends, but
because of lack of time, lack of effort, fear of failure,
youthful stupidity or elderly stubbornness, we never
were.  I will always regret not trying harder to nurture 
those glimmers of connection.  I will always grieve the 
loss of my father, but more than that I will grieve for 
the relationship we could have had.</p>

<p>I’m always looking for ways to speed up my Mozilla build, since it allows
me to test my changes even quicker.  I was really excited when I found out
about <tt>make -s tier_app</tt>, since it sped up my compiles by a huge
amount.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>make
real    10m22.630s
user    4m28.072s
sys     1m27.807s
</pre>


<p>vs.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>make -s tier_app
real    0m14.426s
user    0m6.502s
sys     0m3.957s
</pre>


<p>But yesterday, on IRC, I heard about <tt>libs_tier_app</tt>, which is ever
faster, if you haven’t changed any IDL files (which I usually don’t).</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>make -s libs_tier_app
real    0m9.407s
user    0m5.440s
sys     0m3.065s
</pre>


<p>Okay, it’s not nearly as good as going from 10 and a half minutes to 15
seconds, but a 30% (or is it 50%) speedup is still nothing to sneer at.</p>

<p>Recently, I made some changes to <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/thunderbird/mercurial">my work flow</a> to get around
some slight annoyances.  Specifically, I switched from using <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MqExtension">mq</a> to using <a href="http://arrenbrecht.ch/mercurial/pbranch/">pbranch</a>.  The features that pbranch
gives me that mq didn’t basically boil down to two main things;
sharing, and tracking.</p>
<p>With pbranch, it’s way easier for me to share my changes, both with
other people, and with myself in a virtual machine.  It <em>is</em> possible
to share the patch with mq, by cloning the patch repo if I remembered
to run qinit -C, but with pbranch all I have to do is clone the main
repo, and my changes are right there, waiting for me.</p>
<p>For tracking, when I’m nearing the end of a patch, and it mostly
works, I get really nervous if I can’t check in my changes.  With mq,
I set up an alias to let me commit the patch queue, so that I could go
back, but it was really hard to tell what I had changed between any
two commits, since it was showing me the diff of my diffs.  And so I
didn’t use it as much as I would like to.  With pbranch, I just commit
the code, like I want to, and it keeps track of what the patch should
look like.</p>
<p>So, my day-to-day workflow now looks more like this:<br>
If I’m working on a bug that I’ve already got a patch started for, I
cd to the appropriate branch, type <tt>hg pgraph</tt> to see where I
am, and <tt>hq update branchname</tt> to get to the pbranch I want to
work on.  Then I make my changes, and when I’m happy with the results
of <tt>hg diff</tt>, I type <tt>hg commit</tt> to put the changes into
the pbranch.  After that, I use <tt>hg pdiff &gt;
../branch-name-bugnum-description.diff</tt> to get a patch that I can
upload to bugzilla.  At this point, I usually load the patch into Vim,
and search for some of the mistakes I’ve made in the past.
(<tt>/^+.*[[:space:]]+$</tt>, and <tt>/dump</tt> caught a lot of my
initial mistakes.  Now I’ve moved on to things that are tougher to
check for, like putting open-parens on a new line instead of on the
previous line.)  I usually go through a couple of cycles of <tt>hg
commit</tt>/<tt>hg pdiff …</tt> before I’m happy with the patch.  Once
I am, I don’t have to type anything before I upload it, since it’s
already committed.</p>

<p>I chose <strong><em>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</em></strong> 
<strong>by Michael Chabon</strong> (2000) as my pick for the book club,
thinking it would be a sure thing. It's a great read, everyone
loves it, and there will be lots to discuss. Right?</p>
<p>Wrong. Two book club members hated it ("Sentences too long!
Words too big!") and two love/hated it ("Such beautiful
writing! But I don't care about comics! And why the hell are
we in Antarctica?!") Two more didn't finish it but were
pretty sure they would love it after they did finish it,
so that's good, I guess. I was completely thrown by that
reaction—I honestly thought everyone would love it 
unreservedly.
What's not to love?! They didn't seem particularly interested
in my questions, either. (Maybe it's time to find a new book
club? But we're reading Salman Rushdie next. I wonder what they
will think.)</p>
<p>I loved Kavalier and Clay this time, too. (I read it and loved it
once before.) The
writing is gorgeous, the characters are beautifully wrought,
the story is gripping. Okay, that bit in Antarctica was pointless
as far as I can tell, but the rest of it was great.</p>
<p>Incidentally, my also-rans for book club picks were <em>Doomsday
Book</em> by Connie Willis and <em>Three Men In A Boat</em> by Jerome K. Jerome.
I have no idea how either of them would have gone over. Sigh.</p>
<p><strong><em>Free-Range Kids: Giving Our Children The Freedom We Had Without Going
Nuts</em></strong> <strong>by Lenore Skenazy</strong>. Lenore Skenazy has been all over the
media lately; she was on Q with Jian Ghomeshi, she was on 
<em>Penn and Teller's Bullshit</em>. Even my mother knew who she was
when she saw this book. Obviously what she has to say strikes a
chord, and what she has to say is that today's children are
dangerously overprotected. Sometime in the seventies or eighties
we all decided that the world is terribly dangerous and that
children can't be allowed out in it by themselves. This is
in contradiction of the evidence, which shows that children
are safer now than they have ever been (apart from when they
are in or around cars). This book convinces, with statistics
and anecdotes and passionate argument, that children need to
have freedom more than they need to be protected from bogeymen.</p>
<p>Skenazy also puts forward her theory as to why we have all 
become so scared (television news and crime dramas) and gives
plenty of concrete ideas as how we can give our children the
freedom and responsibility they need without going crazy with
worry.</p>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.freerangekids.com/">Skenazy's blog</a>
for the latest crazy story about people calling the police because
some kid is walking home from soccer alone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Exit Music</em></strong> <strong>by Ian Rankin</strong> is Rankin's last Rebus book.
I'm afraid I can't review it very effectively; I suppose I
wasn't paying very close attention when I read it. I did enjoy
it. If you like Rebus and Rankin you'll probably enjoy it too,
apart from the bittersweetness of it being the last. I hear his
new book is good too, though.</p>
<p><strong>Some piece of crap by Tess Gerritsen</strong>. I picked up a book from
my mother's side table and started reading it when I ran out
of books while I was out in Sask, and boy was it rubbish. I tried
to look up the title on Tess Gerritsen's website, but it looks
like it's one of the books listed on the "Romance Novels" page.
The link to the "Romance Novels" is hidden at the
bottom of the "Real Books" page, and the "Romance Novels" don't
merit pages of their own, so it's quite possible that Tess
Gerritsen herself knows what a piece of crap this book is. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm sure it's fairly hard to write even a bad 
novel—this one in particular seemed to call for a lot
of research—and further if I could get paid good money to churn out bad
books, don't think I wouldn't. I don't blame her in the least for
writing whatever book it was I read (it was about prisoners of
war in Asia), but I sort of regret the time I spent reading it. Although
it didn't take long to read, and it's probably just as instructive
to read a book that's awful (and figure out why it's awful) as it
is to read one that's wonderful. Maybe more so. All in all I guess I'll
call this a wash.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dead Men Do Tell Tales: The Strange and Fascinating Cases of a Forensic
Anthropologist</em></strong> <strong>by William R. Maples and Michael Browning</strong> recounts
some of Maples' most interesting cases, from the historic (he studied
the supposed remains of the Romanovs) to the gruesome (plenty of 
those—he works in Florida).
I am fascinated by all manner of gore, injuries and death, so
the subject matter of this book was right up my alley. I learned,
among other things,
about how people dismember corpses, about autoerotic asphyxiation, and
about weird ways to commit suicide. (Table saw? Really?) </p>
<p>Maples and Browning write eloquently and beautifully—I'm not
sure which of the authors is responsible for the richness of the
prose, but it made the book a delight to read far beyond the inherent
appeal of the subject matter. Here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dreadful as all these processes [of decomposition] may seem, they
are only the resolution of certain carbon-based compounds into
certain other carbon-based compounds. Carbon is the element of
life and death. We share it with diamonds and dandelions, with kerosene
and kelp. While we may wrinkle our noses at some of its manifestations,
we ought also to remember that this element comes to us from the
stars, which wheel over us forever in silent, glittering array, pure 
fires obeying celestial laws.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, the authors don't shy from matters of philosophy,
and also morality and the challenges of the profession of forensic
anthropology: shortage of skeletons for training, lack of funding,
lack of jobs despite the clear need for more forensic anthropologist.</p>
<p><em>Dead Men Do Tell Tales</em> was an unexpected pleasure.</p>
<p><strong><em>The No-Asshole Rule: Building a Civilized Workplace and Surviving One
That Isn't</em></strong> <strong>by Robert I. Sutton</strong>. This is a book Blake took out of
the library but looked interesting, so I gave it a read. It's pretty much
what the title states: a book about how (and why) to create a workplace
where people are civil to each other. It seems so obvious when you
just type it out like that, but plenty of managers claim that conflict 
and nastiness is crucial to their success. Sutton has plenty of 
evidence to show that rudeness is expensive and unnecessary, and
he provides lots of tips on how to go about acheiving an asshole-free
environment.  There's also a chapter with survival advice for people
stuck working with or for an asshole. Worth a read if you work with
other people, especially if you are part of the hiring process.</p>

<p>A lot of the code I write for <a href="http://mozillamessaging.com/">Thunderbird</a>
has to work on <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/all.html">all</a> the platforms
it supports.  Since I don’t own a <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Linux</a> or
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7">Windows</a> box, and don’t really
want to waste the hard drive space on my <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/macbookpro/specs.html">MacBook Pro</a> with a dual- or triple-boot
setup, I’ve decided to install the other operating systems on virtual
machines.  (I’ve chosen <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>, because
it’s free, and I’m cheap.  As an added bonus, it works quite well, too.)</p>
<p>If I was forced to use a centralized version control system, this would
lead to a bunch of pain, since I wouldn’t want to check in a half-finished
patch, but I would still really want to see what changes I made for one OS,
to try and figure out what changes I need to make for the others.  And I
would want to be able to keep a record of what I did, step by step, so that
I could undo stuff if it turned out to be a bad idea.  (Hey, that sounds
like a perfect task for a version control system!  ;)</p>
<p>Since Mozilla uses <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>, I didn’t
have to deal with any of that.  I had my repository on the host machine,
which I had cloned from the main repo, and I just cloned it into each of
the virtual machines.  Whenever I started a VM, I pulled the latest set of
changes from the host machine; As I fixed stuff on that platform, I
committed to the repository on the virtual machine; And before I shut down
the VM, I pushed my changes back to the host machine.  When I wanted to see
which changes I made to get things working for the platform, it was easy,
and propagating those changes to the other virtual machines was also easy.</p>
<p>When people talk about the advantages of distributed version control, a lot
of the time they mention being able to still commit your changes when
you’re on an airplane, and sharing in-progress changes with other people,
but for people like me who do mainly self-contained stuff and don’t fly
anywhere, supporting multi-platforms with virtual machines and still being
able to track my changes might just be the killer feature.</p>

<p>It's only August 30 but it was cold today—it didn't even break
20 degrees. Between that and the impendingness of back-to-school,
I'm feeling that Fall urge to do something new and interesting.
Where is my new backpack, my textbooks and paper, my list of
classes with unfamiliar room numbers, my anticipation of learning
something and meeting new people? Oh, that's right, overwhelmed by
my children's lives. Which is fine, for a while. Cordelia, at least,
has a new backpack. Delphine doesn't have any new school supplies
because the school, curse them, provides everything she needs.
Don't they know how much I love to buy school supplies?
Although I did buy myself two pairs of pants and three pairs of
shoes on sale at Lands' End!</p>
<p>I applied to take a Toronto Civics course offered by the
City of Toronto, but I wasn't accepted. They were trying
to achieve a high level of diversity in the participants, and
I guess someone had already filled the straight white female
spot. Boo. Sometime, not this term, I would like to take a writing
course somewhere (if they turn out to be worthwhile), but 
this fall my only New and Exciting things will be Momming
a Grade One-er and a Kindergartener, and midwifing my writing
career. Which, come to think of it, is fairly huge, although entirely
self-directed and so less fun than taking a class.</p>
<hr>
<p>The girls and I had plenty of fun last week. On Wednesday we went
to Centreville, an amusement park on Toronto's Centre
Island. Delphine was petrified by the Bee Ride, and chose
a stationary horse (not an up-and-down one) on the carousel. Cordelia
loved everything and went on the (baby, but still scary!) roller coaster
with me. Delphine's favourite thing was the pony ride, although she lined
up for it for about twenty-five minutes and I swear the ride was only
a minute and a half long. Lucky for me, I didn't line up with 
her—the heroic Kat did, while fending off a gaggle of badly
raised little hooligans who were trying to cut ahead. Kat also 
took the girls on the Annoying Swan Ride, so I owe her big time.</p>
<p>Thursday we stayed in the neighbourhood;
we went into the school to meet Cordelia's new teacher. I
love her already—I'm so pleased she opened her classroom to
us a few days before the start of school, because Cordelia has gone
from being scared of going to school to being thrilled by the idea.
It took Cordelia about thirty seconds to feel at home in her new
classroom, and to make friends with her new teacher.</p>
<p>On Friday I took the girls, plus Ursa, to see the IMAX movie 
<em>Under The Sea</em> at the
Science Centre. We were only going to stay for a while but we 
ended up spending the entire day there (and freaking out Ursa's
parents). We visited a special exhibit on reptiles, and a
special exhibit on spies (Delphine's favourite), and spent some
time in the little kids' area. We capped it all off with the
obligatory visit to the rainforest, and were home by five.</p>
<p>It was a genuine pleasure to spend the day at the
Science Centre with the girls.  Now that they're older, 
for one thing, and I've decided <a href="http://www.freerangekids.com/">not to
worry about them so much</a> for another, I really enjoy being with
them, and watching them enjoy themselves. Delphine and Ursa
seemed to get a lot more value out of the Science
Centre together than they do when they're alone—being
able to talk over the exhibits and play off each other while they
experimented really added meaning and depth to their experience. It was
a real-life demonstration of the power of collaborative learning.</p>
<p>Next week we have more fun in store: tomorrow a friend is coming over
with her brood to enjoy a belated birthday KFC feast; Tuesday I am
looking after Ursa and her little brother Otis all day while their
folks move—we will probably go to the library; Wednesday we
have a playdate with Delphine's BFF. Delphine's BFF has a little
sister for Cordelia to play with, and a mother for me to chat with,
so it's a whole family playdate. Those are the best. Thursday 
Blake is taking the afternoon off and we are going to take
High Tea at the Royal York, just because. And Friday the girls
have their back-to-school haircuts at the Fiorio Academy.</p>
<p>Oh, and we're having a no-TV week. The girls have been watching
way too much TV, so we cut them off for the week. Out of
some misguided notion of fairness, Blake and I aren't watching
