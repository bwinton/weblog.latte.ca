Today we had Morgan and Erik over for a Passover/Easter feast.  Morgan
made saucy chicken and chopped liver, and I made fruit kugel and 
Passover brownies and roasted asparagus.  (The asparagus was an afterthought
when I realized we didn't have any vegetables.)  We also had Easter
eggs with the brownies for dessert.
</p>
<p>
The recipes for Morgan's saucy chicken and my kugel both came out of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0969797206/102-4098737-5815362?v=glance">the yellow book</a> and they both turned out really well.
The Passover brownies were made from my mother-in-law's recipe.  They
didn't turn out so well because they didn't cook through;  I didn't
realize until this morning when I tried to turn them out of the pan.  I 
glued the whole mess together with Glossy Chocolate Frosting made from
a recipe in my old Betty Crocker book, and it worked really well.  I
thought the whole meal turned out great, considering all the recipes we
used were new to us.
</p>
<p>
We all ate and ate until we couldn't move, and then squeezed in a little
more, and now I'm <em>so</em> tired.  It was good; I love holiday food.

                    <p>
I had a meltdown yesterday.  I was trying to play on the computer and
Del wanted me to hold her, but I knew if I did she'd try and mess
with the keyboard and grab things and 
generally be a pain in the ass.  So I gave her
some toys to play with, but she wasn't interested.  Then I gave her
some objects which, while not technically toys and therefore more
interesting than actual toys, are still pretty safe;  I gave her 
a yellow translucent
set square from an old math set.  I gave her a red glass dreidel I 
bought in Venice.  I gave her a rolly drafting ruler.  I gave her the
very best of my random desk drawer crap, and she still wasn't interested.
I begged and pleaded with her to just sit down and play for a few
minutes, but she just hung onto my leg and cried to be picked up.
</p>
<p>
Finally I lost it.  I yelled, "Would you just shut up!", and picked up the
keyboard and banged it on the desk, which made a very satisfying and
very loud noise, and scared the crap out of her and made her <em>really</em>
cry ("I'll give you something to cry about!") and then I didn't even
have the decency to feel bad.  Instead I got up and stormed around the house
cleaning up, because the mess which I had unsuccessfully being trying to
clean up all day was playing on my nerves.  Delphine crawled
around after me, sobbing miserably.
</p>
<p>
After a couple of minutes I had cleaned up the worst of the mess and relieved
some frustration, 
and I gathered the poor weeping bundle into my arms and we cuddled and
nursed in the rocking chair and I apologized for scaring her and for
getting angry, and I told her I love her.
</p>
<p>
And of course all I achieved in the end was teaching her that when Mummy
sits at the computer Very Bad Things happen and it is Scary, and you
should always cry when Mummy sits at the computer, just in case.
Still, I taught myself that getting angry at a baby is not only useless, it
is often actually counter-productive.
</p>
<p>
I have attachment parented myself into a corner.  I've always held Delphine
a lot, because she is happier being held than not.  I don't know
if that's standard baby behaviour, or if it's my fault for not somehow
teaching her to play by herself.  Indeed, she does play by herself sometimes,
and I might be overstating the amount of time she needs to be held.  And
maybe soon enough she won't want to be held at all, and I will wonder what
I was complaining about.  But for right now, it seems like she is 
<em>always</em> in my arms.  I hold her when I do housework, I hold her when
I cook (if it's safe), I hold her when she naps.  She's eleven months old!
I need my arms back!  I love it when Blake comes
home and takes her so that I can be free to cook and wash dishes without
her clinging to my legs.  (<em>Cooking and washing dishes is my Fun Me 
Time!</em> Fuck!)
</p>
<p>
And at the same time I feel like such a loser for complaining about my
terribly difficult life when my friend Debbie back home is holding down 
three paying jobs at the same time as bringing up her son.  When I know
there are single Moms out there who would love my problems.  I feel like
such a asshole for not being able to handle a baby as sweet and calm as
Delphine without losing my temper.
</p>
<p>
This problem is exacerbated by a concurrent but largely unrelated crisis 
of confidence I'm having about my life in general.  I've been thinking 
a lot about what
I want to do with myself, and I'm pretty displeased with myself so far.
I make lots of jokes about being a slacker and an underacheiver, but 
underneath I really believe I should do something useful with my time
on this earth.
It's true that being a good mother is important work, but I don't believe 
that it is enough of a contribution to the world; it's a
good start, but one should give more if one has more to give, which I do.
</p>
<p>
I'm disappointed in myself that I haven't done more.  I'm disappointed that
I only have a lousy three-year degree.  I fear that I will get to be 
thirty-five or forty and realize my life is half over and I still haven't
done anything useful or valuable.  I'm pissed off that I have this
big meaty brain and I don't have anything to show for it, no job, no
shiny post-grad degree, nothing except a small child with a big meaty 
brain of her own.  I fear that I really <em>am</em> lazy and stupid, like I 
call myself all the time.
</p>
<p>
I still don't know what I should do when I grow up, but I'm starting to
suspect that I have already grown up and the time to do anything is running
short.

I'm not updating much, am I?  I started to wonder if I should have a
journal (or weblog) at all.  I can't be attracting much traffic with
my infrequent updates and rather dull life.  But on the other hand
it's nice to have a place to write things out when I need to think about
them, and to keep track of my life to look back on later.  A sensible
person would keep a private journal, but I've never been able to maintain
a journal just for myself.  Even though I know hardly anyone reads this,
I like the idea that anyone can.  Plus sometimes people find me through
Google and I have something useful for them, which is nice.
</p>
<p>
We went to the doctor on Tuesday because Delphine has had a cold, and on Sunday we 
noticed a rash on her torso.  She had a shitty day yesterday, crying
and miserable all day, but last night she slept like an angel.  By
the time we went to the doctor this morning the rash was all but invisible
and I looked like a crazy neurotic mom.  The doc said that rashes like
that are pretty typical symptoms of a viral infection.  She checked Del's
glands, lungs and ears and she looks generally okay, although she said
to look out for an ear infection in about a week.
</p>
<p>
While I was there I asked about being checked for rheumatoid arthritis.
I said I'd heard that if it's treated early enough they can prevent it
from getting worse, and I didn't want to miss the opportunity to treat it
early.  (Trying, as usual, not to sound like a hypochondriac -- I feel stupid
complaining about arthritis at 28 years old.)  The doctor
doesn't think it's rheumatoid because it's only in my hips. She thinks it's
osteo-; I think it might be rheumatoid because it started when I was in 
high school, it went away when I was pregnant and came back with a vengeance
after Delphine was born, and because that's what my mother calls her
arthritis.  Actually, now that I think about it I didn't tell her the first
thing, and the last thing is perhaps not so useful.  Anyway, she ordered
a blood test to check for rheumatoid factors (which will also apparently
detect syphilis -- good to know) so I duly went to have my blood taken
and soon we'll know either way.

There isn't much going on with Delphine lately.  She's
been busy having colds lately, and that seems to have put a damper on her
development.  She's still cruising, not walking, and babbling, not talking.
She is still very mild-mannered and observant and generally a pleasure to
be around, except when she's miserable about being sick.
</p>
<p>
We have been reading to her a lot.  I read a book called <em>Babies Need
Books</em> by Dorothy Butler which I can't recommend enough.  Butler is
passionate about books, and she makes a very strong argument as to why and how
babies should be exposed to books at a very young age.
</p>
<p>
I had given up on the book thing when Delphine was about eight months old
because she didn't seem interested in reading, more in pulling the books
apart and eating them.  The Butler book convinced me to try again, with 
more patience, and it seems to have worked.  One of the things Butler says
is that babies always go through a stage of demolishing books when they're
first exposed to them, whether that be at six months or three years.  You
just have to forge through it until they learn that the content of the
books is more interesting than the flavour of them.
</p>
<p>
So I tried again, picking a few of the books Butler recommends, and it's
really working.  Reading is now the main activity we do together (since Delphine
doesn't really play with anything yet) and Del seems to enjoy it.  She 
looks at the pages and turns them, sometimes even at the appropriate time, if
it's a book she knows well, like <em>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You 
See?</em>.  She does all the activities in <em>Pat The Bunny</em> except
sniffing the flowers, and I can't say I blame her about that.
</p>
<p>
One of the things which made reading easier is that I stopped being such
a stickler about how we read together.  I used to think that she had to
be in my lap, but now I'll read to her while she's sitting apart from me
and playing with something else.  It helps that I can read upside down,
so I can point the book at her and read the text from above.
</p>
<p>
I'm really enjoying all the great books out there.  The Butler book helped
me get a feel for what makes a good baby book, and each week we go to the
library and I'm able to find half-a-dozen books which fit the bill.  I
really like <em>Mr Grumpy's Outing</em> by John Burningham, and 
<em>Peepo!</em> by Janet and Allen Ahlberg, the Mog books, <em>Brown
Bear</em>... there are a million of them.  I just got <em>Hand Hand
Fingers Thumb</em>, a Dr Suess book (although not by Dr Suess) which is
hilarious.  Except the text says "monkey" and the pictures are chimps.   Sigh.
I'll have to clear that up with her when she gets older.

That's all. Go read <a href="http://smartypants.diaryland.com/">Mimi

A while ago I said I was going to cut down to 2000 calories a
day, but I've been having a hard time doing so.  It seems so lame, 
when you consider that there are so many people on 1200 and 1600 cpd
diets, that I can't even cut down to a still-excessive 2000 cpd.  The
difference for me is that when you're on a diet, you know it's a 
temporary thing, that even if you can't have the cookie or the chocolate
today, one day when you're not on the diet anymore you'll be able to.
Since my diet isn't a temporary change, I am reluctant to give things up
because I know it's forever.
</p>
<p>
My ultimate goal is to eat an average of 1800 calories per day.  You
need to take in about 1600 calories per day to get all the nutrients
you need; that's 1600 calories of real food, leafy vegetables and
whole grains and lean meat and fruit.  At 1800 calories a day that
only leaves 200 calories free for "fun" food.  That's less than a 
chocolate bar.  That's just two cookies.  I'm sure there are plenty
of people in this world who live without having fun food every day, but
I'm not sure I want to be one of them.
</p>
<p>
This resistance to giving up treats is what has made it so hard to
break the 2000 calorie barrier.  I've been hovering around 2050 for
the last few days, but yesterday I decided if I can be under 2000 every
day this week, I will reward myself with some tacky makeup or something
on the weekend.
</p>
<p>
I have a couple of strategies I'm working on.  One is to have a big
breakfast with lots of protein and fruit, to keep me going without hunger
until lunchtime.  Then theoretically I'll be able to have a smallish lunch.
</p>
<p>
Another strategy is to keep digestive 
cookies in the house.  It sounds counter-intuitive to diet by keeping 
cookies in the house, but digestives are pretty low calorie*, and a couple of 
them plus a cup of tea are enough to satisfy my desire for
a treat in the afternoon.  If I don't have them around, I'm likely to
go to Starbucks and get a 200 calorie mocha and a 500 calorie scone.
I think of them as a pressure valve.
</p>
<p>
[*Actually digestives are still pretty high calorie -- around 75 calories
each.  I think next time I will buy social tea biscuits or something,
which are only around 22 calories each.  That way I can have six of them!]
</p>
<p>
Anyway, having said that, I weighed myself at the doctor's office 
this morning and
I have lost another 5 lbs to bring me down to 190, with a BMI of 30.7.  That's
only 0.7... um....  BMI units? away from being merely "overweight", not "obese".
How exciting!
</p>
<p>
I'm curious to see if I plateau at 185, since I have never been able to
diet down past 185.  I think that might be my adult low, actually.  (I 
don't know what I weighed in high school, although I do know I was wearing
size 36 Levi 501s.  I should go try on a pair and see if I fit into them.)
</p>
<p>
I've lost a total of 42 lbs from my pre-pregnancy weight, but I don't 
feel 42 lbs smaller, and I don't think I look it.  I get the odd comment,
but not the barrage of compliments that you'd hope for when you've lost almost
20% of yourself. 
Part of the problem is
that I haven't bought many new clothes, so I'm still wearing my 230 lb
wardrobe; my look now is "baggy".  And of course there's the fact that
for so long I've been so militantly happy to be fat that most of my
friends know better than to say "You've lost weight!" as a compliment.  
Still, it would be nice to know that my shrinkage is perceptible to
others.
</p>
<p>
I read an article by a woman,
my height, who described herself as plump and unattractive.  Then she said
she needed to lose 20 lbs to feel desirable -- she was 155 lbs and wanted
to be 135.  Twenty pounds is the difference between unattractive and desirable,
and I've lost twice that!  Before, I felt like me, and now, I feel like
me.  I guess it's good that I don't invest my weight with so much meaning,
but the flip side of that coin is that when I lose weight I don't get
the big irrational ego boost.  Humph.

                    The idea of IDEs not being forced to rely on text files has been
popping up in several of the <a href="http://www.cardboard.nu/archives/000250.html">weblogs</a> I <a href="http://blog.colorstudy.com/ianb/weblog/2004/03/09.html#P67">read</a>.
While I think Alan has part of the reason correct (there's a lot of
infrastructure dedicated to dealing with text files), I don't think he
has it all.  There are definately some <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch05s01.html">major
advantages</a> to putting things in plain text files, which seem to be
being ignored

For instance, <a href="http://www.phantomfiber.com/">my company</a>
has moved from a binary resource format to a <a href="http://www.ardiri.com/index.php?redir=palm&amp;cat=pilrc">text-based
resource format</a> precisely because of the advantages it brings.
(Well, okay, we never went with the binary format, but that's because
the people making the decision saw the problems it had at previous
places.)  Those advantages being:

<ul>
<li>No tool/vendor lock-in.</li>
  <li>Easier to fix when something goes wrong.</li>
  <li>Easier to see the differences when something changes.</li>
</ul>

I suppose these benefits could also be had by using a standardized
text-based (or xml-based) representation of the image for loading and
saving, along with smarter tools for editing, but I'm not sure that
making the tools smarter is such a good idea in the first place.
Should my source code control system really be forced to know about my
programming language?  What if I change languages?

We've made a couple of decisions in the last few days which sit
well with me.  Little things, but little things which will amount
to big improvements in my life.
</p>
<p>
First we decided not to renovate the kitchen.  We were going to
do a pretty sizeable reno, knocking out a wall, changing cabinet
doors, new countertops and backsplash, and a new paint job.  I 
would have looked really great, but it was largely cosmetic and
would have been in the neighbourhood of $10 000, probably more
if you factor in the inevitable delays and fuckups.  That's a 
lot of money for a would-be-nice reno.
</p>
<p>
We decided to keep the money (most of it coming from my stock
options) and put it into paying down our mortgage.  That way 
we'll be able to use it later when we buy a house, which will
probably be in much more dire need of renovating than our 
ten-year-old condo.
</p>
<p>
Second we decided to set up an "office" for me, with the
Windows box and my Palm cradle and the printer all set up
and the filing cabinet nearby.  This means I'll be able to
go back to using my Palm for appointments (because I only use
it when I can use the Palm Desktop) and I'll be able to print
stuff out and manage the household that much easier.  Right
now it's a bit chaotic, with Windows on a laptop which drifts
about the house, my Palm cradle not hooked up to anything, and
the printer just barely working in a corner.  It's a pain in 
the ass.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I've been doing lots of little spring cleaning things,
getting rid of or putting away stuff which doesn't apply any
more.  Stuff like my music stand, which I used when I was taking
voice lessons.  I finally folded it up and put it away, which
means that I've accepted that I won't be taking voice lessons
again for a while, and also that I won't have to clean around
it.  I've put away our funky fruit stand because we have nowhere
to keep it; it was on top of a bookcase but up there we never
noticed it so the fruit just rotted.  Now I don't have to worry
about where to put it.  I'm going to put away our wine glasses,
which will free up another two feet of book shelves, and I won't
have to dust them, nor do I have to think about how we're not
really the kind of people who need wine glasses.
</p>
<p>
It's about getting my physical surroundings in line with the
life I actually live, getting rid of things which aren't relevant
any more, and making more space, physical and mental, for the
things which are.

Not much to say, I just feel like being heard and I've been away from
the Suspects for so long it would be weird to just step back in and start
talking about myself.  Isn't that what blogs are for?
</p>
<p>
It's a partly cloudy day, and I feel my mood rise and fall precisely
with the appearance and disappearance of the sun.  Delphine is in the
middle of a long nap, and I should be doing housework but I'm catching
up on Mimi Smartypants and Dooce instead.  Morgan's coming over tomorrow
afternoon to babysit while I houseclean, so that has given me license
to slack off and play with the baby instead of trying to clean.  Which
is good because Delphine has a cold and she's needy and cranky and
really doesn't want to have to hang desperately onto my pants leg as
I try and wash dishes.
</p>
<p>
I'm coming down with a cold, too, probably the same one.  It's only
mild as yet, just a scratchy throat.  Hopefully I'll lick it quickly
and pass the antibodies onto Del so we aren't sick for too long.

I went to the doctor today for my annual physical.  I always enjoy
physicals because I'm generally healthy, and when else do I get to spend
forty five minutes talking with someone all about me! me! me!?
</p>
<p>
Everything's good; she gave me the go-ahead to work on another baby,
which is great if academic since I'm still amenorrheic due to nursing.
Apparently most women start ovulating while they are still nursing.
Also the average age difference between children when birth control
is not used is 22 to 28 months, and pregnancies started before that
are more likely to miscarry, although they're not sure why.  Interesting
facts which all basically mean we will let nature take its course, and
also that I will start taking folic acid now so I'm all ready to go
whenever my body is.
</p>
<p>
I also talked a bit about the arthritis that's developing in my hips.
There's not a whole lot they can do about that, which is a bit of
a pisser.  She said if there's a lot of pain, or I'm anticipating
some activity which will cause pain (like tennis, she said.  That'll
be the day.) I could take a prophylactic ibuprofen to inhibit the
inflammation which causes more joint damage.  Also, losing weight
is a great idea, she said.
</p>
<p>
And hooray, I'm down to 195 lbs!  I haven't seen this side of 
200 lbs lo these many years.  (I'm also down to a size 18, another
numeric milestone.)  I'm quite pleased that I'm still
losing even though I've been sitting at 2100 calories per day for
quite a while now.  The doctor suggested I should go down to around
1800 calories a day, so I've changed my goal in Fitday to 2000
cpd, and I'll work my way down.  
</p>
<p>
The challenge is going to
be eating properly; I have a tendency to skip real food in order
to save calories for treats like pastries and ice cream.  Such
a bad idea.  I'm going to try watching my food groups, making
sure I get 5 to 10 fruit and veg, 6 to 12 grain, etc etc.  I have 
to be in good nutritional shape to make another beautiful 
healthy baby.  I think it will be easier now that spring is
coming; fruit and salads always seem more palatable in warm
weather.  In winter I just want large piles of meat and potatoes.

                    In my copious free time, I've started helping Rick Price rewrite the
internals of Progect (a project management application for the Palm)
in a more object-oriented manner.  It's an interesting task, getting
to redesign an application with a well defined set of features, and
I'm glad to be able to help, even the little that I can.

As the project progesses, and as I get the free time, I'll add more
of my thoughts on the topic to this category, so that we will have
a record of what the decisions and thought processess were that went
in to the new design.
