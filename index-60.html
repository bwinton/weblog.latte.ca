<p>I've always wondered how they do it, those women. You know the ones,
the women who are on the board of this organization and the fundraising
committee of that, who have two children and a dog and a full-time job.
The women who do it all. How?</p>
<p>For example, the president of our School Council (PTA to you) is
a full-time lawyer, and she has two little kids. How does she manage?
Where does she find the time?
So I asked her. I did, I just asked her. And for one thing, she doesn't clean.
She has a giant house and she gets someone
in every weekend to clean. That's a whole day of cleaning, probably
$200 a week or so. Of course she has childcare: she has a nice young
woman who looks after the kids and probably does light
housekeeping too. I don't know what else she doesn't do, but she's
not averse to spending money so I bet she pays people to 
do quite a lot of mundane crap. I know I would if I could manage it.</p>
<p>I know dozens of these women with full-time jobs and children
who none-the-less
manage to take on huge volunteer roles in the school, or in other
organizations.  They don't all have money, so it can't be that
they all outsource all that time-consuming everyday crap.
And yet here I am, with my two kids and not much else on my
plate, barely making it through each day. Why?  There's nothing in
particular wrong with me, that I know of. What do these other
women have that I lack? Time? Ambition? Passion? Amphetamines?</p>
<p>Finally I decided that rather than try and work this out 
deductively I would just run an experiment.  I would go ahead 
and sign myself up for
a bunch of stuff and see what broke.</p>
<p>So this year, I'm chair of the school's Eco-Committee. (So far we've
had one meeting, submitted a grant proposal, and sent a lot of email.)
I'm working on the Crafts booth for our school Winter Fair.
I'm class parent for Delphine's class, I help out in the library
for two hours every two weeks, and I get to school at 8 am on 
Thursdays to help with Junior Choir. I run twice a week.  I have 
choir, and book club,
and that whole "writing career" thing I said I would get started
on.  I still have two children and a cat to look
after, and a house to run. 
Oh, and I have friends who sometimes I like to hang out with, and
a husband who, frankly, I barely ever talk to about anything other
than household administrivia. And I like to watch TV. And read—a lot. 
And there's this blog. And the eight hours of sleep that I really,
really enjoy.</p>
<p>Under all that weight, something's bound to break. Perhaps it will
be sleep. Perhaps it will be housework. Perhaps it will be one of
my new responsibilities. Perhaps it will be my mental
health. Or perhaps it will turn out that I'm one of those women who can
do it all. Perhaps all I needed to do was try.</p>

<p><em>Clonk.</em></p>
<p>That was the sound of Cordelia's head hitting the wall behind me when
she scrambled to hide behind my legs. What was she hiding from? Why,
another adult tried to talk to her. Horrifying.</p>
<p>And then, just a couple of days ago, someone's nanny helped her off a
too-high ladder in the playground. That sent her into a five-minute
paroxysm of screaming fear and rage.</p>
<p>Cordelia is a fearful child*. I don't know how this has happened, but
it has. She's scared of being away from me, and she hates being spoken
to by any adult outside of a small set of acceptable people. She 
constantly tells me she loves me, and she wants to touch me all the
time, as if without a physical or audible expression of our love it
will disappear.</p>
<p>Delphine isn't like that. She carries with her a confidence that 
she is loved, that she can handle herself, and that everything will
be fine. Oh, she's very emotional and things get blown all out of
proportion, but it's all on the surface. Underneath it all she is,
as one of her kindergarten teachers put it, steady.</p>
<p>Cordelia's emotional outbreaks seem underlaid with panic, some kind of
apparently bone-deep fear that if she isn't 
constantly affirming the love of those around her it will evaporate.</p>
<p>And yet it seems when she forgets to be afraid, she's fine. She loves
her kindergarten teacher and her class. She can play by herself
for ages, if she can get past that initial hurdle of Walking Away.
This is a terrifically painful stage (for both of us) and yet surely
it is only a stage. At home she's such a happy, enthusiastic kid with such
great passion and ideas. I hope the passion wins over the fear.</p>
<hr>
<p>* I know in my last Cordelia post I said she wasn't fearful. I guess
I didn't see the fear before. It's pretty subtle—mostly her clinginess
manifests as merely whiny or needy—but I've since started to 
see the undercurrent
of real fear or panic in the way she holds on to me, and the pitch
of her screams.  </p>
<p>Knowing your child is an impossible art which you can nonetheless 
never give up.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that Santa brings us presents and lives at the North Pole.
But what does his house look like? It has a Santa chair and
a fireplace with the fire usually on and smells like cookies.</p>

<p>It’s kind of exciting, having checkin privileges.  It means that I
don’t have to wait for someone else to check in my changes once
they’re accepted.  But on the downside, it means that I’m the one who
has to do the commit, and watch the <a href="http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=Thunderbird3.0">Tinderbox</a>, and
if anything goes wrong, I’m even more on the hook than I previously
was.  (Well, that last part isn’t really true, but I feel way more
nervous than when I could just add “checkin-needed” to the bug, and
not worry about it anymore.)  And basically there’s just a lot of new
stuff for me to keep track of, and figure out.  But since anything I
do is going to show up in the official history, I need to figure it
out <em>before</em> I do it, which always adds a little pressure, which in
this case is probably a good thing.</p>

<p>Dave Pell thinks <a href="http://davenetics.com/2009/10/top-25-reasons-were-fucked/">we're fucked</a>. Or rather, Dave Pell thinks most of the stuff people
post to Twitter is a boring waste of time. Why he chose to express
that as "we're fucked" I'm not sure. We're fucked because the
earth is heating up and no-one has the balls to do anything about it,
but that doesn't have much to do with Twitter.</p>
<p>Dave Pell doesn't like people posting about the following
on Twitter: where they are; current events and their opinions
on them; the party they are at; their children; flight delays; their
small fitness triumphs; jokes or puns they made up or ideas they
had; what they're listening to; what they're thinking about; where they
are; the state of their inbox; the weather.</p>
<p>You know what all those things are? They're small talk. Small talk is
a social lubricant. Small talk is how you get to know someone better so you
can decide if you want to share Big Talk with them.  Small talk is
how you connect with other human beings, it's how you reach out and
find out what you share. It's how you gain an understanding of 
how everyone else experiences the world.</p>
<p>Small talk is not profound.
No-one can be profound all the time, but if the only time we're allowed
to connect with other people is when we have the energy and
insight to be profound, this is going to be one hell of a lonely
life. </p>
<p>I love people. I love being with people and sharing and
chatting about kids and weather and books and news. Sometimes the
conversations I have with people are superficial and trivial, sometimes
they are intense and intellectual. Sometimes the conversations I
have with people are in the flesh, and sometimes they are on the Internet.
Either way, I make a connection, and I feel happier and more human.
Does that mean I'm fucked? I really don't think so.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, I made my Christmas puddings. I know it seems early 
to make Christmas anything, but you have to let Christmas puddings
hang around for a while after you make them. Like, a couple of months.
Also you have to stay on top of
Christmas or it will kick your ass. </p>
<p>I always have to do a special trip to the bulk food store to buy all
the preserved fruit that goes into Christmas pudding, and no matter how 
hard I try to buy the right amount, I always
end up with piles of leftover raisins and candied peel and slivered almonds
after the puddings are made. I don't know about you, but I don't
have that much use for candied peel and slivered almonds in my day-to-day
life. Usually they sit around until July and then I throw them out.
This year I was determined to do better.</p>
<p>I tried to think of some context (besides Christmas pudding) in
which candied peel, almonds and raisins aren't, well, kind of gross, and 
I kept coming back to 
shortbread cookies. I don't know if I've had shortbread cookies with
all that stuff in them, or if I just made it up, but in
my head it made sense. I couldn't find a recipe for exactly what
I had in mind, but I found a Martha Stewart
recipe for 
<a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/rum-raisin-shortbread">rum raisin shortbread cookies</a> to get me started.</p>
<p>I used raisins instead of currants because raisins were what I had too
much of (I managed to buy the exact right amount of currants).
I used lemon zest instead of orange zest because that's what I had,
and because there's lemon zest in my Christmas pudding. I substituted
rum for the vanilla because I wanted to make them as rummy and
Christmassy as possible, and instead of the shredded coconut I put
in ¼ cup slivered almonds and ½ cup candied peel.</p>
<p>They turned out perfectly, just as I had imagined them. They're
very Christmassy and rich; Christmas Pudding in cookie form. Here's
the recipe:</p>
<h4>Christmas Pudding Shortbread Cookies</h4>
<h5>Ingredients</h5>

<ul>
<li>½ cup dark rum</li>
<li>1 cup raisins</li>
<li>½ pound unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
<li>¾ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
<li>½ teaspoon finely grated lemon zest</li>
<li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>¼ cup slivered almonds</li>
<li>½ cup chopped candied peel</li>
<li>1 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
</ul>
<h5>Directions</h5>
<ol>
<li>Combine rum and raisins; cover, and let stand at room 
temperature overnight. Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon rum.</li>
<li>Beat butter, sugar, and lemon zest with a mixer on medium speed 
until creamy and smooth, about 2 minutes. Add reserved rum, and beat 
until combined. Reduce speed to low. Add flour and salt, and beat for 
3 minutes. Stir in raisins, almonds and candied peel by hand.</li>
<li>Form dough into 2 logs, each about 1 ½ inches in diameter; 
wrap in parchment, and refrigerate 1 hour (or up to 3 days).</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 325. Remove parchment. Slice logs into 
¼-inch-thick rounds, and space about 1 inch apart on baking 
sheets lined with parchment. Bake until pale golden, about 20 
minutes. Let cool. Cookies can be stored in an airtight container for 
up to 1 week.</li>

<p>I took out <strong><em>Understanding Your 6 Year-Old</em></strong> <strong>by Deborah Steiner</strong> in
an attempt to understand my six-year-old, and it worked pretty well.
Six-year-olds are in a horrible state: they realize they're not
good at everything, they realize other people don't always like them,
they realize other people's lives are different (and sometimes
better) than their own, and on top of all that they realize that
Mum isn't infallible. It's too much. No wonder they're so crabby.
Reading this book helped me understand Delphine's perspective.</p>
<p>This is an English book translated for an American audience. I hate
it when they do that, nominally because it's patronising to 
Americans to assume they can't understand Anglicisms, but in
truth probably because I'm an Anglophile and I think (irrationally)
that English
English is better than American English. Anyway, either it's
impossible to completely Americanize a book like this, or they
did a lousy job because right from the first paragraph when she
talked about "infant's school" I knew it was an English book,
so all the Americanisms they did manage to slip in came off as 
glaring incongruities. Goodness knows what it would have been like
to read as a unilingual American; very disquieting, I imagine.</p>
<hr>
<p>The September 16 issue of New Scientist magazine had a section
on science fiction, guest edited by Kim Stanley Robinson.
Robinson said, "the range, depth, intensity, wit and beauty 
of the science fiction being published in the UK these days 
is simply amazing", so I thought, hey, I used to love science
fiction, I should try it again. Sounds cool. </p>
<p><strong>Robert J. Sawyer</strong> is
a Toronto SF writer who gets some favourable press, so I
picked up his novel <strong><em>Rollback</em></strong>. It's about a woman who
initiated conversation with aliens in 2009. By the time
the aliens' reply reaches earth, the woman is in her eighties
and near death. A rich businessman offers to pay for a
"rollback" treatment for the woman, which will return her
to the health of a twenty-five year old. She accepts on the
condition that her husband gets the treatment, too. To say
more would spoil the plot, but there's romantic intrigue and
alien contact and tragedy and stuff. </p>
<p>Plot-wise it was a good
read, but I can't say it renewed my love of SF. I didn't
buy the premise that the only person who can continue to
communicate with the aliens is the person who started to. 
The writing
was no better than servicable—my bar for writing quality
has gone way up in the last few years.
The dialogue was lumpy; do writers not say their dialogue out
loud to see if it sounds like something anyone would ever say?
And there were some very awkward pop culture references which
were very clearly the author's own opinion, put into the mouth
of his characters: diatribes on TV shows, extensive discussion
about the Atkins diet, a Slashdot reference. The book was
published in 2007 and the near-future part was set in 2009,
and already the Atkins and Slashdot references were painfully
anachronistic. The world changes so fast that writing 
near-future SF is playing with fire. (Although I'm not sure 
that any astrophysics professors were reading Slashdot even in 
2007. I could be wrong; I stopped reading Slashdot in 2003.)</p>
<p>The characters were likeable and believable, the plot was 
interesting and kept me turning pages, and there were some 
interesting ideas presented about aging, and fidelity. But if
this is the best the SF has to offer (and Sawyer does keep
winning SF awards) I'm not surprised that SF writers don't win
any "literary" awards. But I'm not giving up yet—Kim
Stanley Robinson talked about UK SF writers, so I will read
some of his recommendations, and my brother (who loves
the same kind of writing that I do, Salman Rushdie and Kazuo
Ishiguro and Khaled Hosseini) likes the writing of Charles
Stross, so I will read him too.</p>
<p>Speak of the devil (hah!), my next read was <strong><em>Haroun and 
the Sea of Stories</em></strong> <strong>by Salman Rushdie</strong>, which I read
for Book Club. I thought it was great, nice and light with
a million references (pop culture and otherwise) to pick up,
and a nice rich allegory to mull over when the book is done.
(Okay, am I the only person who thinks "Butt the Hoopoe" is
a "Mott the Hoople" reference? It could be!) This book
manages to be both light and richly complex, like
some kind of light but richly complex wine. (That's what you
call the Trivial Metaphor.)</p>
<p>Before I read <strong><em>Keep it Real: Everything You Need to Know 
About Researching and Writing Creative Nonfiction</em></strong> <strong>edited 
by Lee Gutkind</strong> I didn't know what Creative Nonfiction was,
and I'm not entirely sure I know now, but I think I read
quite a lot of it. It seems to refer to those books and
magazine articles which
take a nonfiction topic and write about it in a literary
way, like Mary Roach's books about sex and corpses, or 
<em>The Perfect Storm</em> by Sebastian Junger. This book is a
collection of short (very short, a page or two) chapters
about various topics relevant to writing Creative Nonfiction:
research, composite characters, libel, fact-checking, quotation
marks, etc. That the chapters are arranged alphabetically brings
a certain randomness to the book, but each chapter is 
clearly self-contained and there isn't much repetition.
The shortness of the chapters keeps it interesting, resulting
in a quick, easy, but very informative read.</p>

<p>September and October have been really slow months for reading.
I thought would be able to read more, what with the girls being in
school, but it really seems like school generates more hours
of work than it relieves. Also, and I cringe to admit it, I
think I have been Twittering when I used to read. Those little
bursts of reading I used to do, when brushing my teeth, or 
between chores, or (it's true) while on the can, are now
spent on Twitter. I didn't think it would make that much
difference, but the fact is I get through most of my reading
three or four or five minutes at a time. I've been making
a conscious effort to read more and Twit less since I realized
the extent of the problem.</p>
<p>This is what I did manage to read:</p>
<p>I picked up <strong><em>Ideas and Details: A Guide to Writing for Canadians</em></strong>
<strong>by M. Garret Bauman and Clifford Werier</strong>
on a trawl through the library one day. This book is mainly
about writing academic papers, but it seems to me the techniques
in it apply to any kind of writing. It's a thinish book, only
around 290 pages, but it covers an astonishing amount of material:
how to get ideas, how to build paragraphs, how to create a
thesis and outline, how to write a draft and revise it,
writing style, word choice, writing descriptions, writing narrative, 
informative, and persuasive writing, how to do research and keep notes,
and yet more. Everything is explained clearly with plenty
of interesting examples and lots and lots of exercises and discussion
questions. This would be a fantastic textbook for a writing class,
but it's also a handy and rich reference book.</p>
<p><strong><em>Slob proof! Real-Life Design Solutions</em></strong> <strong>by Debbie Weiner</strong> 
I don't like to clean, but I like my house to be clean. Or at
least appear that way.  This book leapt off the shelf at me—it's
so seldom that you get a decorator who admits that not everyone wants
to spend their life sponging down white walls or polishing sticky
fingerprints off kid-height mirrors. I have read more than one
magazine article which recommends white slipcovers for a house with
kids because "you can just bleach them once a week!" Sure you
could—but would you want to? </p>
<p>Debbie Weiner knows you don't
want to, and this book is packed with specific recommendations
for upholstery, flooring, and furniture styles which don't show
marks, are easy to clean (if you ever have a chance) and will take
years of abuse from your kids, your kids' friends, your friends' kids
and your big hairy dog. She also has ideas about robust lighting, window
coverings, rugs, and paint colours.</p>
<p>This is a fantastically useful book with great ideas, but I have
to admit I am conflicted about slob-proof decorating. I love white.
I love shades of white and grey and beige all together in one peaceful
wash of foggy whiteness. (I am so not my mother's daughter: her
living room is rain-slicker yellow.)  I also love bright, crisp
white with splashes of sparkling colour: bright azure or sunshiney yellow or
vivid orange or acid green. I don't like a room that is heavy with 
dark, saturated colour: chocolate brown or wine red or navy blue.
So somehow I have to figure out a way to get the white I love while
using the darker, brighter colours on the areas which get the most
abuse or are the hardest to clean.</p>
<p>The one thing missing from this book is advice on creating
a slob-proof kitchen or bathroom. My in-laws' experience with engineered wood
has proven that if you want a sturdy kitchen you need to choose materials
carefully, and my experience with graceful (curvy, impossible to clean)
faucets and a clawfoot tub (how are you supposed to clean behind that?)
have show that choice of fixtures can make the difference between
a cleanable bathroom and one that reduces you to tears.  Some of the 
advice in the book is applicable to kitchens and bathrooms
(Marmoleum!) but it would have been nice to have a section addressing
those areas specifically.</p>

<p>Out of time for today. Stay tuned...</p>

<p>The girls had a fight last night. I was sitting reading,
and they were playing on the living room floor.  They
both wanted a truck that Delphine had made out of Lego; Cordelia
wanted it to play with, Delphine wanted to use the pieces for
something else.  The disagreement soon 
escalated to snatching and hitting, so I intervened.</p>
<p>The Democrative Parenting people suggest that this is 
a splendid opportunity 
to show your children how to resolve difficulties. 
Could Delphine get other, identical pieces out of the 
Lego box? No. Could Cordelia play with some other Lego or
a different truck? No. Could Delphine make Cordelia another,
identical truck so Cordelia could play with <em>that</em> and Delphine
could have the pieces of this truck? No? No. </p>
<p>So you have no interest in actually resolving this, you actually don't
care about the truck or the Lego at all, in fact you're just 
being little assholes and fighting for the sake of it, then? </p>
<p>It was at this point that I got hollerin' mad.  I was mad at them
for being contentious jerks, but also at the parenting
advice people who are all, "Help your children learn to communicate
and resolve disagreements," ignoring the fact that they are
not always tiny little adults who just want to get along. 
I'm no Skinnerian but sometimes you have to treat
them like animals, because sometimes they behave like animals.</p>
<p>So I manged to lose my temper not only at the kids but also at
an entire philosophy of parenting. Hooray!</p>
<p>After I was done hollering at them <em>I</em> went upstairs to <em>my</em>
room, and then they worked it out for themselves.</p>
<p>Alyson Schäfer would say that they were fighting to
get my attention, and my first mistake was intervening when
it got physical—that is, rewarding them for fighting by
giving them the attention they sought. The facts of the case
certainly support that theory: I was ignoring them (by reading),
they fought, I paid attention to them, they kept my attention
by refusing to resolve their fight. They only stopped fighting
when I took my attention out of the picture by leaving
the room. Which is what I should have done as soon as the fighting
started.</p>
<p>(Of course that's easier said than done when you have a tiny
house with only one really good reading spot. Parenting is hard.)</p>
