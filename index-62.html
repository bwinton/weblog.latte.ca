<p>I'm not sure this is the post I want to post, but it's on my mind.</p>
<p>Today I did a positive parenting experiment. Normally Blake and I
nag and cajole 
the girls through their morning, until we're all angry at each other
and we end up rushing to school in a sweaty rush. Lousy
way to start the day, so I decided to Schäfer it up: I would
tell the girls what was expected of them and what I would do, and
then I would step back and let them take responsibility for their
morning routine.</p>
<p>They were forty minutes late for school.</p>
<p>Here's how it went down.
We ate breakfast together, and then I went upstairs to take a shower 
and dress,
with the following message: "You guys need to take your two trips [to
the kitchen with stuff from the table], pack your lunches and snacks
and get dressed. If you have time can you give Thomas his food and 
water?" At that point they had enough time to complete everything
if they got on with it.</p>
<p>While I was in the shower they fought. While I was getting dressed they
fought and then played. After I was dressed I came 
downstairs—the table was not cleared and they were both still 
in their pajamas.  I carried on without agitation or urgency. I finished
clearing the table while they played, them I folded laundry. At 8:30 I let them
know the first bell was ringing at school—they were
still in their pajamas, but at that point Delphine started to rush. She
asked for, and received, help packing her lunch, while Cordelia stayed
in her pajamas. Delphine tried to get Cordelia to hurry up, 
and she agreed to pack Cordelia's snack while she got dressed. Finally
we left the house at 9:05, and signed in at school at around 9:20.</p>
<p>I was calm on the outside but on the inside I was freaking out while
they played as if they hadn't a thing to do all 
day. It was a miracle of parental self-restraint. I didn't even 
nag on the way to school, I let being late speak for itself. (When
you say "I told you so" or "let this be a lesson to you" it's called
piggybacking and it turns a natural consequence into a punishment,
which just gets you caught up in a power struggle and demotivates
the child.) Being on time
for school is not my problem, it's theirs. My job is to provide 
them with the tools and information to get to school on time.</p>
<p>Tonight we're going to have a family meeting to talk about 
mornings. My suggestion will be to make a morning routine poster,
and I will let them know that a) I will only remind them of their
morning responsibilities once, b) I will not play with them in
the morning, and c) I will let them know what time it is every ten
minutes. Hopefully they will come up with some ideas of how to
stay focussed in the morning.</p>
<p>I hope tomorrow goes better. I know I'm supposed to be detached
and aloof, but the school expects the parents to "get" their children
to school on time, so I do feel responsible and guilty when they
are late. Also, I have a few morning meetings and appointments coming
up which I don't want to be late for. I'll have to review my 
parenting books and see what I'm supposed when my kids are making me
late. In the meantime I will repeat the following phrase: "It will
get worse before it gets better. It will get worse before it gets
better."</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What I Did Wrong</strong>: I sprung this new behaviour on them without
warning. As I said, normally we
nag and hustle and bother them all morning and I think that's where
they get their clues as to how late they are and what they should
be doing. Today I remained calm and I think the girls interpreted 
that to mean that we were on time, even though I told them in words
that we weren't. Actions really do speak louder.</p>
<p>Also, we were running a teeny bit behind right from the start. Not
behind enough to make us late, but behind enough that we needed to
be brisk. So I would say I'm responsible for about five minutes of that
forty. I would rather our mornings were leisurely but focussed, which
will mean I need to be more disciplined about getting up and fixing
breakfast on time.</p>
<p><strong>What I Did Right</strong>: I think otherwise I applied the principles of
positive parenting correctly. I remained kind yet firm, I didn't 
get into any power struggles, I told them what I <em>would</em> do rather 
than what they <em>should</em> do.</p>

<p>For the last six years I've been reading parenting books. I've read
dozens of them, some good, some useless, but a handful stand out as
books I've reached for time and again when I had a question or
a problem, or just needed some reassuring company. These are 
the books I would buy (if I were rich) for 
every expecting mother I know. </p>
<h5>Start At The Very Beginning</h5>
<p>Well, not the very beginning—there are lots of books about
pregnancy and childbirth out there, but childbirth is such an
unpredictable and personal thing that you'd have to read a library's
worth of books just to learn the handful of things which will apply
to your situation. Your best bet is to find a good midwife and stay 
off the Internet.</p>
<p>Once the baby comes you'll want to feed it, and the best nursing
advice I found (in book form—again, a trustworthy advisor
is your best bet but unless you were clever enough to marry
 a lactation consultant you'll
need a source of midnight advice) is <em>Breastfeeding Made Simple: Seven
Natural Laws for Nursing Mothers</em> by Nancy Mohrbacher and Kathleen 
Kendall-Tackett. The title is an exaggeration, of course—no book
can make breastfeeding simple— but their advice is soothing, 
practical, and research-based.</p>
<p>After a while your baby will be ready for, as we call it, people
food, and the best introduction to the subject is <em>Better Baby Food:
Your Essential Guide to Nutrition, Feeding and Cooking for All
Babies and Toddlers</em> by Daina Kalnins and Joanne Saab. Published 
by Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children, this book introduces you
to the nuts (actually no nuts) and bolts of feeding babies and
small children, from nutrition advice to guidelines on when to 
introduce different foods. There are recipes for everything from
purees to delicious entrees the whole family
will enjoy. We love their hot and sour soup, and the chocolate
chip oatmeal cookies are divine. There is a good mixture of 
healthy meals and homemade treats, plain food and sophisticated
flavours. All the recipes are clearly written and easy to follow,
with common ingredients.</p>
<p>My only caveat with <em>Better Baby Food</em> is that it was published 
before the latest advice moved weaning age up to six months, so 
their baby food recipes are suggested for four months and up.</p>
<h5>Sleep, Gentle Sleep</h5>
<p>The best sleep advice around is to be found in Dr. Marc Weissbluth's 
<em>Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child</em>. Weissbluth is pragmatic,
respectful of your child's need to sleep (and yours) and insistent
on the importance of a good night's sleep. I wish the book were
better edited, as it is sometimes hard to slog through his academic
pontificating to get to the actual advice, but once you've found it
it's gold. People keep borrowing my copy.</p>
<h5>Dear God What Next?</h5>
<p>Children change all the time; no sooner do you think you've figured
your little one out then they become someone slightly different.
I have often thought to myself, sometimes dispairingly, "Is this
just a phase, or is this what she's <em>really like</em>?" The <em>Your 
N-Year-Old</em> series by Louise Bates Ames and Frances Lillian Ilg
can help answer that question. Each book comes with a subtitle which
is a teaser for what you can expect in that year of your child's
life; your three-year-old is "Friend or Enemy", your four-year-old
is, alarmingly, "Wild and Wonderful, but then you're rewarded with a 
"Sunny and Serene" five-year-old. </p>
<p>These books have
given me perspective on what my children are going
through developmentally and what I can expect from them, both
good and bad. Now, when Cordelia throws a giant fit because I
cut her toast the wrong way, I can just wait it out with a 
shrug—"She's four"—rather than dispairing that I've
borne a drama queen and she'll always be like this. These books make it
possible to untangle the influences of developmental stage from
my children's real personalities.</p>
<h5>Discipline</h5>
<p>No less than four books (plus two) on this topic. They all cover 
about the same territory but in slightly different ways, so I suppose you
could pick your favourite and just read that, but I find it's helpful to
reinforce this stuff periodically, and this way you don't have to do
it by rereading the same book over and over.</p>
<p><em>Kids Are Worth It</em> by Barbara Coloroso, <em>Positive Discipline</em> 
by Dr. Jane Nelsen, <em>Unconditional Parenting</em> by
Alfie Kohn, and <em>Breaking The Good Mom Myth</em> by Alyson Schäfer are
all books about positive parenting, or unconditional parenting, or
democratic parenting, or Adlerian parenting, which are 
variations on a philosophy of parenting which regards children
as full and equal members of the family with equal rights to respect
and dignity. It's the style of parenting I have chosen because it
seems most right and effective to me, and the books listed are all excellent
guides to parenting in that style. </p>
<p><em>How To Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk</em> by
Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish is a light but effective guide to talking
to your kids (rather than at them). This book is thick with specific
ideas and techniques to help you communicate with your kids. The
same authors wrote <em>Siblings Without Rivalry</em>, which teaches how to
manage siblings, with plenty of examples, cartoons and summaries.</p>
<h5>Reading</h5>
<p>In between feeding, disciplining and putting your children to sleep
you might want to spend some time with them, and a great way to do that
is in the company of books. <em>Babies Need Books: Sharing the Joy of
Books with Children from Birth to Six</em> by Dorothy Butler is an
impassioned appeal to parents to read early and often. Butler tells
us not only why and how we should read, but what, with long lists of
great books for every stage from birth to six.</p>
<h4>Perspective</h4>
<p>In the thick of all this advice you'll want some perspective. Having
a second child is a great way to get perspective, as well as a good dose
of humility (if you thought your child's awesomeness was to your 
credit) or absolution (if you thought your child's horribleness was
your fault). If you're not ready for another child, though, these books
will put your parenting—and all the advice you're getting—into
its proper context.</p>
<p>The amply sub-titled <em>The Boy Who Was Raised As A Dog: And Other 
Stories from a Child Psychiatrist's Notebook: What Traumatized 
Children Can Teach Us About Loss, Love and Healing</em> by Bruce
Perry and Maia Szalavitz is a collection of case studies of children
who have gone though horrible trauma—abuse, cults, 
neglect—and what they can teach us about childhood
development and resiliency. This book will help you because no
matter what you're doing "wrong" you can't do as much harm to your
child as has been done to these children, and because despite such
miserable childhoods many of these kids go on to be normal,
functioning adults.</p>
<p><em>Perfect Parents: Baby-care Advice Past and Present</em> by Christina Hardyment
is an overview of the crazy, yet earnest, advice given to parents 
(usually mothers) over the last hundred and fifty years. Parents have
been admonished on topics from hugging (bad) to breastfeeding (bad)
to warm baths (bad), and some of the advice will leave you open-mouthed.
Following the advice is almost always presented as vital to the fabric of 
society, and yet somehow, civilization has soldiered on
despite the failings of mothers everywhere.</p>
<p><em>How Not To Be The Perfect Mother</em> by Libby Purves is a memoir 
written by Purves while she was, as she puts it, at the
"coalface of practical early motherhood". Funny and pragmatic, Purves
offers advice and reassurance without judgement. "A good hungry dog
mooching around the high chair helps."</p>
<p>My children are six and four, and I expect I have at least ten years 
of parenting books ahead of me, so I suppose this list will change, 
but I've been through two babyhoods and two toddlerhoods and am
now firmly in the realm of parenting children. Books have been a
terrific help and comfort to me through this journey, and I hope this list
can help other parents find their path.</p>

                    <div>
<p><a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/everythingelse/thoseWomen.html">Back in
November</a> I talked about those women who do a million and one 
things—have a career, have a nice house, do charity work, volunteer
 at school—and how I'm going to be more like them. So far
it's going pretty well—I helped with a fundraiser at school,
I'm chair of a somewhat underachieving Eco-committee (part of the problem
being that whenever we think of something eco to do it turns out the
school is already doing it), and so far my children haven't starved
to death or sickened due to the filthy state of the house. One thing
did falter: I missed a few notes in
the Christmas concert because I wasn't at the dress rehearsal.
Lesson learned.</p>
<p>But I digress. The reason I bring this up is that I realized that
this ambition, to Do Lots of Things, is a subset of a bigger ambition
which I have just put into words: Be More Awesome.</p>
<p>As I have discussed before, I see myself as a veritable well of
unfulfilled potential. Sure, I have a rather lame math degree 
and two lovely children, but other people my age are running
for city councillor and writing books and,well, being awesome. I want
at least a little piece of that.</p>
<p>Let me digress again for a moment. The school is getting a second 
kindergarten playground, and the eco-committee wants it to be
a natural playground, one of those jobbies with logs and rocks
to play on instead of metal and plastic playstructures. Great idea, 
very eco. We (mostly I) came up with this idea ages ago, but I
wasn't sure where to start, who to talk to, how to broach the 
subject. So I didn't do anything.</p>
<p>And then last week I busted up my back (You know why? Because in
my last post I was all "I haven't hurt my back for over a year!"
Stupid.) and I was stuck on the couch all week. Rather than
be completely useless I did some research on natural playgrounds
and then I emailed the principal. I was all, "The eco-committee
is exploring the idea of a natural playground for the new 
kindergarten playground", and I went on to briefly describe a
natural playground, and explain why we (I) thought it would be
a good idea. I cc'd the vice-principal, our trustee, and the rest
of the committee, and hit send. </p>
<p>Three minutes later the 
trustee replied saying he would be happy to attend a meeting
about this proposal. Proposal! It was just an idea, a whim!
But by writing it down and sending it to some people,
it became a proposal. Thirty minutes later the 
principal responded with a five-paragraph email, cc'd
to about a billion more people, saying
that they had considered a natural playground, we should meet
soon and what was my thinking? We're meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>That's it. That's all it took: an idea, some Googling and a
judiciously cc'd email, and now we have a proposal and a meeting.
Obviously I'm going to have to prepare for the meeting, and there
will be other jobs coming down the pipeline, but all it took
to get the ball rolling was one email message.</p>
<p>What I have learned from this is that the path to awesomeness is
paved with tiny baby steps. This a truth neither profound 
nor abstruse, but it has been a long time coming to me.  I 
don't like to act on things unless I <em>know</em> how they're going to
turn out. And not just the first step, I like to know what's
going to happen four or five steps down the line. I like to think things
through and anticipate problems, and prepare for them.  This is a
wonderful trait if you're going camping, or taking two small people
downtown, or going on vacation, but it has its limits.
When I'm contemplating something complicated or new, or that
involves other people, I can can always think of nine or ten 
ways stuff could go horribly wrong. Thus, paralysis. Inaction. Failure
to be awesome.</p>
<p>A while ago I read a book called <em>Feel the Fear... And Do It 
Anyway</em> by Susan Jeffers and as you can see from 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/books/_2008/non-fiction.html#fear">my
discussion of it</a>, a) this blog post is well overdue and b) I am
a broken record. The good news is that I've taken the lessons I learned
from the book on board—the ideas that were new to me back in
2008 are a comfortable part of my daily coping repertoire now. So,
odd as it seems, these realizations, that I am scared to act if I don't
know I will succeed, and that it only takes a small step to start getting
things done, actually represent progress in my quest to be more awesome.</p>

<p>I got a great email newsletter from David Allen (of 
Getting Things Done fame) about taking stock of the
year's accomplishments and completions. He included a
list of categories to focus on, which I am going to
use to consider how 2009 was for me and what I'm going
to change in 2010.</p>
<h5>Physical</h5>
<p>After a c-section in 2003, another in 2005 and gallbladder
removal in 2007, 2009 was refreshingly free of major or 
minor surgery. I don't think I had a single episode of major
back pain, either, so maybe I have finally figured out how
to deal with that (mainly stretching, and strategic use of
ab muscles). I did some running after school started in September, 
but a bout of H1N1 in November sapped my motivation and I haven't 
run since.</p>
<p>I recently went to the doctor for my irregularly scheduled annual checkup
and everything checked up fine, but I have gained twenty pounds I 
wasn't entirely expecting. (I don't weigh myself at home so the 
pounds have lots of time to creep on between doctor visits.)
I will be addressing that situation in
the new year, along with everyone else in North America. I've 
been very self-indulgent with my eating habits lately—I
need to be more sensible about that, and I'm going to switch
from running to walking in the hopes that I can slip it into my
daily routine easier. I also think that doing yoga regularly
would cure most of my mechanical problems.</p>
<h5>Emotional</h5>
<p>I have to admit this has been a difficult year for me,
emotionally. I have been pretty unhappy about a couple of
things—doing all the housework myself, for 
example—and have felt almost entirely alone with
that unhappiness. Blake and
I are rubbish at confrontation so I tend to never try and
resolve problems with him. And they fester. As if that's not bad enough, I
don't have an extra-marital emotional support system to listen 
and offer support and suggestions. I used to have
my brother, then I had Sascha and my BF-as-it-turns-out-not-F
Janet. My brother and Sascha got lives and Janet dumped me,
and then Delphine was born, and I guess I haven't had any
real emo needs since then, until this year. This year has been
very emo but I've mainly dealt with it on my own, mostly in
the basement while folding laundry. That sucks. Kat is a 
good ear, but I can't drop everything and cry on the phone
to her whenever I'm unhappy. The laundry needs folding and
she has a job.</p>
<p>Obviously in 2010 I have to do that a little better. What
do I do? Make a new friend? One without a job or any children?
Get a therapist? Start a private journal? Go to a marriage
counsellor? I will have to figure something out.</p>
<h5>Mental</h5>
<p>Mentally I think I have held my ground this year. As I mentioned
in my book blog, this year hasn't been terrifically intellectually
rigorous, but I read a few thinky books and I've been keeping up
with my Walruses and New Scientists. I'm happy and excited with
my decision to pursue writing as a career. I love to read and
think and write, and if I can possibly make some kind of money at
it that would be awesome.</p>
<p>Next year, obviously, I have to kick the writing into  a
higher gear. It's very hard to get anything done in the two hours
that Cordelia is at school, so I have to figure out how to focus my efforts
in that time (less twitting and housework, more actual writing).
I have both girls on a list for daycare starting in September, but
of course paying for daycare demands that I earn an income. This
is more terrifying to me than perhaps it should be.</p>
<h5>Spiritual</h5>
<p>I think I'm in the same place spiritually that I was a year ago.
I don't think about it much.  I don't believe in the 
supernatural but I derive a feeling of
wonder from the immensity of the universe, from the magical
unlikeliness of our existence, from my children. I try to be
good. In 2010, more of the same.</p>
<h5>Financial</h5>
<p>We paid off our line of credit! Of course, Blake was on 
contract and he didn't pay taxes all year, so come April we may
be in debt again, but for now we are debt-free. Hopefully a year
from now we will be debt-free for sure.</p>
<h5>Family</h5>
<p>My family is awesome. The girls are going through an utterly
charming patch, and I'm happy with our parenting. I haven't
yelled in ages! Next year, I hope that will continue. Five
and seven are both supposed to be pretty charming ages, so that
looks good.</p>
<p>Further afield, I would like to be closer to my brother. He
just moved in with a girl who I know next to nothing about,
and I have no idea what's going on with him generally. I should
also call my mother more often. So should you, probably.</p>
<h5>Community Service</h5>
<p>Before this year I wouldn't have had a lot to say in this category,
but this year I did a ton of work for my kids' school, and did
it ever open my eyes to the amount of free labour the school boards
of Canada get from parents. I worked in the library, volunteered
in the classroom, helped run a craft room for a fundraiser, went
on a field trip, was class parent for Delphine's class, and signed 
up to head the Eco-committee.</p>
<p>This year I hope to actually <em>do</em> something as head of the Eco-committee,
and I'm going to try and pursuade our School Council to donate some
money to a school without so many deep-pocketed parents. I suppose
I'll be roped into running the craft room again next Christmas, too.</p>
<h5>Fun / creativity / recreation</h5>
<p>You know, I've been thinking about fun lately, specifically in the
context of play. The children play most of the time and work hardly
at all—Delphine works a little bit at school, and she has
a couple of jobs at home, but most of her time is free time.
Cordelia is four—she plays at school and she plays at home,
and her only job is feeding the cat. </p>
<p>But when do I play? On the one hand I'm in the very lucky position
of rarely having to do something which I'm not intrinsically motivated
to do. I look after the children because I love them, I take care
of the house because I want my house to be taken care of. I
read and write because I love to do so, I have fun volunteering
for the school. There is almost nothing I do that's pure drudgery.
And a lot of what I do is pure fun: most of my reading, choir,
my friendships, and watching TV are all things I do for myself.</p>
<p>In 2010 I would like to read more, and keep singing and seeing
my friends. I'm even happy with the amount of TV I watch, or
rather with the quality of TV I watch. I should try and
use my time more mindfully, so I don't fritter it away. I have
too much fun stuff to do to spend time doing things which are merely
diverting.</p>
<p>That's that. It's 12:21 am on January 1. I hope everyone
has a wonderful year in 2010!</p>

<p>This post is for those of you who enjoy that particular kind of humour
derived from small children saying entirely inappropriate things in all
innocence. Lucky for us we have a four-year-old, so we have plenty
of that.</p>
<hr>
<p>The other day Blake and the girls and I took the bus to the
Ontario Science Centre. It was a chilly morning so while we waited
for the bus we huddled together, the girls in between Blake
and I, like penguins. Since I don't know what sound penguins make,
I said, "Buck, buck, buck, bgawk!"</p>
<p>With that Cordelia squeezed out of our little cluster and declared
loudly, "I got laid!"</p>
<hr>
<p>The other morning Blake was brushing his teeth, and because we have
small children, he wasn't alone. He has a tongue pierce, and part of
its care and feeding is that you have to brush the stainless steel
balls of the jewellery every day. So, that's what he was doing when
Cordelia asked the obvious question, "Are you brushing your balls?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Yes I am."</p>
<p>"You should tell Mummy!"</p>
<hr>
<p>This one is less inappropriate. The other day my friend Kat and I
watched that "David after dentist" YouTube video for the first 
time—the one with the kid recovering from anaesthesia and
saying silly things.  Kat works with little kids and I live with
them, and we didn't find the video particularly funny because kids
say peculiar things all the time. </p>
<p>Case in point: Today, after
a full day, then dinner, with her jammies on and her teeth about
to be brushed, Cordelia asked, "Mama, is it morning or bedtime?
I don't know when it is. I forgot!"</p>
<p>So yeah, "Is this real?" doesn't seem all that funny.</p>

<p>Another year, another giant stack of books. Here's how it all boiled
down in ought-nine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Total books read: 66</li>
<li>Adult Novels: 16, of which six mysteries, and six for the book club.</li>
<li>Young Adult Novels: 4, two of which by Kit Pearson</li>
<li>Non-Fiction: 42, of which:<ul>
<li>9 books about writing;</li>
<li>6 books about parenting;</li>
<li>16 how-to and self-help (or psychology) books;</li>
<li>leaving 11 others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Memoir: 5, three by Bill Bryson</li>
<li>CanCon: 12<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I felt like I wasn't reading much this year, and I was right. Further, it
wasn't my most profoundly intellectual of reading years. I only
read four adult non-mystery novels of my own accord (the rest were for
the book club). I read
a bunch of non-fiction books, but plenty of them were "how to decorate" or 
"how to garden"-type books. </p>
<p>Interesting that I read three more books about writing than I did about
parenting. I guess I'm getting pretty confident about the latter, but 
still petrified to take the plunge into the former.</p>
<p>Here are some standout books, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Pictures of Perfection</em> by Reginald Hill is a beautifully written
mystery.</li>
<li>
<em>A Handful of Time</em> and <em>A Perfect, Gentle Knight</em> by Kit Pearson
both made me cry, as did</li>
<li>
<em>Elijah of Buxton</em> by Christopher Paul Curtis</li>
<li>
<em>Free-Range Kids</em> by Lenore Skenazy and <em>Unconditional Parenting</em> by 
Alfie Kohn pushed me to raise my parenting game</li>
<li>
<em>Dead Men Do Tell Tales</em> by William R. Maples and Michael Browning
was surprisingly profound and yet also provided me with lots of
gross anecdotes for cocktail parties.</li>
<li>I called <em>Everyday Survival</em> by Laurence Gonzales as one the best
of the year back in January when I read it, and I was right. It's
astonishing in its depth and breadth, and the way Gonzales brings
it all together is breathtaking. In fact, I can hardly believe it
was so good—I'm going to have to read it again and see.</li>
<li>And a special mention to <em>Getting Started As A Freelance Writer</em> 
by Robert Bly for planting the seed of the idea that I might be
able to earn a living at this thing I do for fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next year I'm going to try and clear out at least half of the 
two feet of my to-be-read shelf before the end of May. I'm going
to try and read more novels, and I'm going to strive, as always,
to be a more attentive and thoughtful reader.</p>

<p>A while ago I read <strong><em>The Ten Year Nap</em></strong> <strong>by Meg Wolitzer</strong>, 
for book club, but I forgot to write it down and therefore
didn't blog about it at the time.  It's 
about a handful of New York mothers who variously
work, don't work, volunteer, don't volunteer, bake, don't bake,
have great marriages or disappointing ones. It's about the
choices women make about work and life, and about how you
sometimes find you've made life-changing choices without
really knowing it at the time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately nothing happens in the first 92 pages of
this book. There are chapters and chapters and chapters 
of character development and backstory until you wish
you could step into the book with a handgun just to make
something happen. Finally something happens, there's a couple
of chapters of action, and the book ends. It's all a
bit boring and I probably wouldn't have finished it, if
it weren't for the book club. Ironically I didn't 
end up going to the book club meeting, but I bet it
was a good one. We always have more fun talking about
books we didn't like, and despite the slowness of the
story, this book provided plenty of discussion fodder for
a group of urban mothers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Heat Wave</em></strong> is a book "by" <strong>Richard Castle</strong>, the fictional
protagonist of the TV series <em>Castle</em>. He's a well-connected
mystery writer, played by Nathan Fillion, who shadows a sexy 
New York cop (Stana Katic) for research.
The book is about a magazine writer who shadows a sexy New York
cop for research. It was very disconcerting to read a book
written by a fictional character, about a second-order 
fictional character who was clearly based on the first-order
fictional character (who in turn is played by an actor who I follow
on Twitter, providing yet another layer of reality/unreality
confoundment). But besides that it was a clever and
funny mystery very much in keeping with the TV show. </p>
<p>Another torturous read courtesy of the book club (it's
been a bad year): <strong><em>Autobiography 
of Santa Claus</em></strong> <strong>by Jeff Guinn</strong> is a history of Santa Claus
written as an autobiography, from the character's origins
as a child named Nicolas who would be a bishop and later a saint,
all the way to the portly elf we know today. Along the way
Guinn explains how Santa manages to make all the toys and get
all the way around the world so fast. He might explain some
other stuff, but I stopped reading around the time Santa
Claus convinced Queen Isabella to sponsor Christopher 
Columbus's search for a better route to India. The book is
full of such Forrest Gumpian connections. The funny thing
is, all the people that old St Nick befriends, including King
Arthur, and Attila the Hun, share the same 
early-21st century belief system as Santa (and, I imagine,
most of the readers of this book). </p>
<p>I love Christmas and I love Santa Claus—well, I don't mind
him—but this book is simple-minded glurge. I would enjoy
a real history of Santa Claus: how his story has changed
throughout history, and what the changes mean in the context of
their time. This is not that book.</p>

<p>Greetings, visitors, and welcome to our funny little blog. Blog-o!
is written by me (Amy)—I'm a stay-at-home mother who loves to
read, write, bake, and blog about all of those things and anything
else—and my husband Blake, who is a full-time work-from-home 
coder who likes to bike and eat my baking. </p>
<p>This blog is hard
to put into a category—some days it's a 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/girls/">mommy blog</a>, some
days it's a <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/books/">book
blog</a>, some days it's a <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/">coding
blog</a>, some days it's just an 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/whingeing/">annoying self-absorbed
emo blog</a>. It's not what you'd call a focussed writing project. 
But it's us, and some people think we're pretty amusing. We'd love
it if you stay awhile, poke around, maybe drop us a note. Enjoy!</p>
<p>(Note to regular readers: I wrote a

<p>Earlier today, I was asked by <a href="http://www.andreasn.se/blog/">Andreas Nilsson</a> to give him a hand with a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=535021">folder pane header
bug</a> he was trying to
fix.  In the middle of digging around in the code, I thought “I should
really write this down, so that I can understand it later.”, and so here it
is.</p>
<p>The main place we’ll need to change is in <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mail/base/content/folderPane.js#55">this object</a>.</p>
<p>We start in the <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mail/base/content/folderPane.js#60"><tt>load</tt></a>
method, which calls <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mail/base/content/folderPane.js#67"><tt>registerMode</tt></a>,
to add the mode with its localized name.  There is also a <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mail/base/content/folderPane.js#984">default list of
modes</a>,
which will come into play later.</p>
<p>When the user chooses to <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mail/base/content/folderPane.js#200">cycle the mode</a>,
it calls the <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mail/base/content/folderPane.js#250">setter for <tt>mode</tt></a>,
passing it the modename, which comes from the <tt>_modeNames</tt> list
(which contains both the defaults and any newly-registered modes).  Then,
in the setter, if the mode is a default mode, it will fail <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mail/base/content/folderPane.js#254">the if-test</a>,
and get the localized name from the “bundle_messenger” string bundle.  If
it’s a newly-registered mode, they will have passed in a localized name
which we will have stored in <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mail/base/content/folderPane.js#178"><tt>this._modeDisplayNames</tt></a>,
and so we will <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mail/base/content/folderPane.js#255">use that</a>.</p>
<p>The point of the bug is to switch the label-and-two-buttons to a dropdown
menu, so at this point I think we should start with an empty
<tt>menulist</tt> in the XUL, and in the <tt>load</tt> method add
<tt>menuitems</tt> corresponding to the values in the <tt>_modeNames</tt>
array.  Then, in the <tt>registerMode</tt> and <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mail/base/content/folderPane.js#187"><tt>unregisterMode</tt></a>
methods, we should add and remove new menuitems, which I’m hoping will just
automatically show up in the dropdown.  Finally, we need to change the
setter for <tt>mode</tt> to not calculate the new name, but just select the
appropriate menuitem set the <tt>mode</tt> attribute on the
<tt>_treeElement</tt>, and call <tt>_rebuild()</tt>.  At that point, I
think we’re done, but only time will tell.</p>

<p>While I was at the Toronto iPhone Tech Talks, I attended the OpenGL ES
sessions by <a href="http://twitter.com/funnest">Allan Schaffer</a>.  Seeing the
“Shock” demo was really inspiring, and caused me to want to try my
hand at some simple OpenGL Shader demos.</p>
<p>The base XCode OpenGL ES Application template sets you up pretty
nicely for some simple experimentation, the only things that gave me
any trouble were:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>remembering to set the identifier to ca.latte.whatever so that I
could build, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>remembering that the OpenGL ES 2.0 path only ran on the device, so
of course none of the changes I was making were showing up on the
simulator<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="blake/tech/opengl/experiments/#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and finally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figuring out that depth was position.w, and not position.z.  (Did I
mention that I’m a bit of a newbie at this?)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyways, after it was all up and running, I made the x and w
co-ordinates vary on a different period than the y co-ordinate, and
now the square moves around in 3 dimensions in a pleasing (to me) way.</p>

<p>Since this is intended for me to play around with shaders, I’m not
going to bother updating the OpenGL ES 1.0 code path, but if you’ve
got an iPhone 3GS, or a 3rd generation iTouch, feel free to grab the
code at <a href="http://bitbucket.org/bwinton/opengl/">BitBucket</a>, and play
around.  I'll be adding branches and tags and keeping it updated as I
play with new stuff.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/runmad">Rune</a> let me know that Open GL ES
2.0 is supported in the latest version of the simulator.  I guess I
must have been testing with an earlier version of the SDK, or XCode,
or something. <a class="footnote-backref" href="blake/tech/opengl/experiments/#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></p>
