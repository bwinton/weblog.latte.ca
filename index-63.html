<p>I posted this as a comment over at <a href="http://www.hollie.us/">Hollie's
blog</a> and thought I should put it here too.</p>
<p>We were at the grocery store today and Blake and Cordelia were 
having conversations on the pretend phone – you know the one 
you make with your little finger and thumb outstretched?</p>
<p>Well, Cordelia called Blake and said, “Is Mummy there?” Actually, 
what she said was “Give it to Mummy”, but she meant “Is Mummy there?”</p>
<p>So Blake held his pretend phone up to my face, and I said, “Hello?”</p>
<p>Cordelia paused, giggled, and said, “Bye!”</p>
<p>That’s right, she prank-called me on the <em>pretend phone</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve run into <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=545933">a bug</a>.  It’s a really annoying bug, because it prevents me from changing
folders when I try to test any of my Thunderbird changes.</p>
<p>I tried putting dump statements everywhere, to see if I could figure out
what was going on, but they were to no avail.  Then, I thought about
looking for the error code.</p>
<p>So the <a href="http://silver.warwickcompsoc.co.uk/mozilla/misc/nserror?0x805E0006">error lookup page</a> says
that the error that’s reported is:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">Module</span>          <span class="nn">Severity</span>        <span class="n">Number</span>
<span class="n">CONTENT</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">25</span><span class="p">)</span>    <span class="n">Failure</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>     <span class="mi">6</span>
</pre>


<p>And
<a href="http://scotland.proximity.on.ca/dxr/mozilla-central/content/base/public/nsContentErrors.h.html#l59">DXR</a>
says that Content Error 6 is:
    NS_ERROR_CONTENT_BLOCKED</p>
<p>Which occurs, among other places,
<a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mozilla/content/base/src/nsDocument.cpp#1129">here</a></p>
<p>But when I set a breakpoint there, it didn’t hit it.  So instead of
trusting mxr or dxr, I did a grep (well, an ack, but same thing), and
started setting breakpoints on a few of the hits.</p>
<p>The one that hit my breakpoint ended up being <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mozilla/docshell/base/nsDocShell.cpp#7643">this
one</a>
which, weirdly enough, isn’t even listed in the mxr results of <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/ident?i=NS_ERROR_CONTENT_BLOCKED">this
search</a></p>
<p>Now that I’m at the breakpoint, we’re halfway there, I hope.  ;)</p>
<p>How I got there was:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>(gdb) bt
#0  nsDocShell::InternalLoad (…) at …/mozilla/docshell/base/nsDocShell.cpp:7643
#1  0x152d9daa in nsDocShell::LoadURI (…) at …/mozilla/docshell/base/nsDocShell.cpp:1369

#10 0x001141a7 in js_Invoke (…) at jsinterp.cpp:1388
[…]
</pre>


<p>And it looks like we get there because the return value of
NS_CheckContentLoadPolicy is 0x80004003, or NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER.</p>
<p>Then, after dinner, I tracked it down a little further, and if you place a
breakpoint on the “\n\nAAAAAA\nrv5=%x\n” line in <a href="https://bug545933.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=427516">this patch</a>, you can
see that it’s the folder = do_QueryInterface(subFolder, &amp;rv); line
which is causing the failure, because the subFolder’s mRawPtr is null.</p>
<p>But I have no idea why <em>that</em>’s happening, so I posted what I had, and
hoped that someone else could take it and run with it.  And Bienvenu did,
and now it’s much less of a problem for me, and I can go work on other
things.</p>

<p><strong><em>Twelve Books That Changed the World</em></strong> <strong>by Melvyn Bragg</strong> is
a book that introduces itself. I believe it's a
tie-in book to a TV series, the kind of TV series that could
only be produced in England. The books range from the
St James Bible to Mary Woolstonecraft's <em>A Vindication of the 
Rights of Woman</em> and, curiously, <em>Rules of Association
Football</em>. Each book is described, put into context, and Bragg
makes his arguments for why it belongs in this list. This is
a great introduction to some seminal written works, but also
a brisk and effective overview of some high points of our society's history.</p>
<p><strong><em>Further Under the Duvet</em></strong> <strong>by Marian Keyes</strong> was recommended
to me by someone on Twitter (I think it was 
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/flossieteacake">FlossieTeacake</a>)
after a discussion of villa-itis, or the fear that you are going
to run out of bread while staying at a French villa. (I have
a chronic case of villa-itis which is villa-independent.) The book
is a collection of personal essays and short stories. Keyes is an Irish
writer with an extraordinary Cinderella story of going
from abject alcoholism to fame and riches as a writer. The story
is told in the book, along with essays on various topics including
the joy of writing
a makeup column (free samples!), air-guitar championships, shopping
and plenty of chocolate. Funny and sweet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Positive Discipline</em></strong> <strong>by Dr. Jane Nelsen</strong> is yet
another positive/democratic/whatever parenting book. I don't know
why I keep reading them, since I more-or-less know what I'm doing
by now, but it's good to be reminded, and I do pick up different
ideas from the various books. This particular book reminded me
of the importance of family meetings, and reassured me that some
problems (namely chores) will have to be revisited at regular
intervals but are still worth handling democratically. I wouldn't
call this my favourite democratic parenting book—it's just
not funny enough. But it's worth a look if you need a refresher
(or an introduction to positive parenting) or if you want a new
angle.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Gargoyle</em></strong> <strong>by Andrew Davidson</strong> is our first book club book
of the year, and already this year's book club roster is looking better
than last year's. <em>The Gargoyle</em> is about a man who gets terribly
burned in a car crash, then meets a mysterious woman with a
bizarre past while he's recovering. It's about love and redemption
and all that good stuff, with a big dose of history. It's beautifully
written and I didn't want it to end.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right</em></strong> <strong>by Atul Gawande</strong>.
I have long been a fan of the checklist. I like to-do lists to keep
my days focused, I like lists of things to take places, I like
to record our daily routines in list form so nothing is forgotten.
This book is the validation for my checklist habit: Gawande writes
about how checklists can improve the outcome of extremely complex
projects, such as construction projects, and surgeries. Checklists
are already in use in construction and aviation, and the book centres
on Gawande and his team's attempt to create a checklist to reduce
the number of fatalities as a result of surgeries. It's not a smooth
path, but along the way we learn the kinds of checklists (DO-CONFIRM
and READ-DO), what makes a good checklist (not too much information,
easy to read), what makes a bad checklist (too long), and the
mind-boggling difference that a checklist can make in a process that
everyone involved feels is already going pretty well. (Gawande
uses his own checklist, and at first he thought it wouldn't make
much difference to <em>his</em> outcomes. As it turns out, not a week
goes by that the checklist doesn't catch something he would have
missed, and it has even saved at least one life on his watch).</p>
<p>As usual, Gawande is engaging and convincing. This was a great
read as well as a confirmation (and refinement) of my love for
checklists.</p>

<p>Delphine loves to read. We've recently been reading time travel books:
we read <em>The Root Cellar</em> by Janet Lunn, and now we're reading 
<em>A Handful of Time</em> by Kit Pearson. She also loves mysteries
(like her mother, her aunt, her great-aunt, her grandmother, her
other grandmother...) and is working on a Trixie Belden novel by
herself.</p>
<p>Delphine also loves to watch TV. She loves <em>WordGirl</em> but she
loves <em>Kim Possible</em> more, which I'm kind of bummed about. Blake
introduced her to <em>Kim Possible</em> because she liked <em>WordGirl</em>
and y'know, female superhero. But <em>Kim Possible</em> is a teenage
character, and well into that "kids are cool and parents are lame"
stage, and I wish Delphine wasn't being exposed to that already.
Unfortunately the horse is out of the barn now; failing another
hard disk crash (hmmmm) we're going to be watching <em>Kim Possible</em>
until Delphine goes onto another thing or I ban TV altogether.</p>
<p>Delphine is no great fan of hard work. At school she goes to great pains
to make sure she's not at the beginning of the line, so she doesn't have
to hold the door. She loves the idea of having lots of responsibilities,
but she hates the reality of dropping whatever fun activity she's
doing in order to do the job.</p>
<p>She has a few jobs lately: she cleans the cat litter every other time
(I alternate with her); she helps clear the table; she's in charge of
her own morning routine and I'm trying to get her to help Cordelia,
too; she is in charge of her own bedroom, including putting away
laundry (which in effect means her room is a mess and her laundry
stays on her desk). The doing of all these jobs is prefaced by a 
great deal of moaning and whining. I feel somehow responsible for that
because I hated housework and it took me years to understand that
if I wanted my house to be nice I had to do the work of making it so.
I also have trouble understanding that things that are worth doing
take effort and time, and aren't always fun. I would like Delphine to
learn that before she's, like, twenty-five. Maybe then she won't be
a big old quitter like I was.</p>
<p>Delphine is in gymnastics, trampoline and swimming this term. I
didn't mean for her to be an overscheduled child, but I happened to
check the city swimming classes and there were classes available at
the right time and the right level, which never happens, so I had
to pounce. She likes the classes in this order: swimming first, 
then trampoline, then gymnastics. This is interesting because swimming
is, like, $90, trampoline is $35 and gymnastics is $225.</p>
<p>Swimming is going very well: she does front crawl and jumps in and
puts her head under water, all of which she couldn't do at the
beginning of the session. With gymnastics she's hit a bit of a 
roadblock because she doesn't like to be upside down. More than
that, she absolutely refuses to be upside down. This rules out
such cornerstones of gymnastics as somersaults, cartwheels, and
anything interesting on the bars. So either she has to bust through
that or I don't think she'll be having any more $200 gymnastics classes.</p>
<p>I think school is going well. It's hard to tell, on account of she's
always in a bad mood on the way home, so she regales me with complaints
about how boring it is and how she hates everyone. Later in the day,
when she's rested and fed, I hear about the interesting things she
did and the fun she had. I suppose both angles could be true.</p>
<p>She seems much older lately; she's moody and critical and opinionated
and complicated. And she's clever and insightful and interesting
and passionate. She's, I think, like me: she's going to have to
grow into her personality. It definitely isn't a little girl's
personality. She's a tiny grown-up.</p>

<p>Today Cordelia read a book! She wanted a second bedtime book, and
I said she could have another book but she had to read it herself.
In the past she has "read" those baby dictionary-type board books with 
a one-to-one word-to-picture ratio. This time she picked a Clifford
easy reader. I stood my ground and got her to read it and she actually read
the whole thing with a combination of all the tools she's
supposed to use: phonics, word recognition, and context. </p>
<p>She kept
saying, "My brain doesn't want to <em>do</em> that!" when I said, "sound
it out" or "that's a popcorn word", but eventually her brain 
stepped up.</p>
<p>(A popcorn word is a word that you recognize on sight, it just 
"pops" into your head. Delphine taught us that terminology.)</p>

<p>You might know that, until recently, Delphine was just too sensitive
to watch movies. Any kind of suspense or peril would send her running
for the farthest corner of the house. But lately she's become more 
blase about everything, and she is much cooler about scary bits
in movies. "Actually this is pretty scary," she will say, while
holding her ground on the couch. So, we've been watching movies.</p>
<p>We started a while ago with <em>The Sound of Music</em>, which is really quite scary
what with the Nazis and all. (Although Delphine was more scared of
the stern father.) Then a few weeks ago we rented <em>Cloudy
With A Chance of Meatballs</em>, then <em>Nanny McPhee</em>. We decided to
have a regular movie night every weekend. After some discussion
we've decided to have matinees so as to avoid too much pre-bedtime
excitement and bad dreams. I'm excited to introduce the girls to some great
movies, and to get back to watching movies myself, even
if only PG-rated ones.</p>
<p>Last week we watched <em>Star Wars</em> (the original one). Cordelia
was really excited to see it, and Delphine enjoyed it in the end.
I think they both liked making sense of all the
stuff the boys in their classes jabber about. Although Delphine 
was very confused as to why Ethan would dress up as a bad guy—Darth
Vader—for Halloween. I couldn't help her.</p>
<p>Here's our list of movies to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bedknobs and Broomsticks</li>
<li>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</li>
<li>Seven Brides for Seven Brothers</li>
<li>Mary Poppins</li>
<li>Fiddler on the Roof</li>
<li>Toy Story</li>
<li>Beauty and the Beast</li>
<li>The Princess and the Frog</li>
<li>Alladin</li>
<li>The Aristocats? (This is the first movie I saw in a theatre, but I can't
remember if I liked it.)</li>
<li>Shrek</li>
<li>The Lion King</li>
<li>The Iron Giant</li>
<li>It's a Wonderful Life</li>
<li>The Muppet Movie</li>
<li>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</li>
<li>Darby O'Gill and the Little People</li>
<li>The Incredibles</li>
<li>Nightmare Before Christmas</li>
<li>Escape from Witch Mountain</li>
<li>The Wizard of Oz</li>
<li>To Kill a Mockingbird (maybe later)</li>
<li>The Princess Bride</li>
<li>E.T.</li>
<li>Fantasia</li>
<li>Babe</li>

<p>Today Delphine described her dream spa. (I don't know how she
knows about spas.) "There would be a really big hot tub, with
books and food and drink right by the edge."</p>
<p>Then she thought for a moment.</p>
<p>"It would be a hot tub in a library!"</p>
<p>That's my girl.</p>

<p>Miss Cordelia is now four years, four months and twenty days old,
and she is well settled into being four. Four is a year of 
experimenting with power, and a year of great emotion. </p>
<p>Cordelia still loves to be with Mummy, but she can be pursuaded
away by a sufficiently compelling offer. On Sunday Zaida stopped
by to take her out. At first when we asked if she wanted to go
with him she said, "Mummy!" and clung to me.  But when I rephrased
the offer—"Don't you want to go on an adventure with 
Zaida?"—she perked up. "Adventure?" And off she went.</p>
<p>Tonight I was talking her through the plan for tomorrow, as I 
do every day, and I said my friend Tanya was going to pick her
up at school and take her for lunch. She pulled the "Mummy!"
thing again, but I said, "Otis [Tanya's little boy] wants you to
come play with him," and then she was fine with it.</p>
<p>Cordelia can get herself dressed to go outside all by herself. She's
so good at it, in fact, that her teacher wanted to make a PSA video
starring her, 
to try and pursuade kindergarten parents to teach their
kids to dress themselves. I don't get to see this skill, however,
because when I go into the class to help with mittens and zippers,
she becomes all helpless and I have to zip her up. I don't help with
boots and snowpants, though, because it is literally easier for 
her to do it herself—she's gotten competent enough that when
I try and help we end up working at cross-purposes and getting in
each other's way. So fortunately that's off my plate.</p>
<p>Cordelia has friends! She is friends with Anna, and Zoey, and
Scarlett and Samantha. Anna was her first friend of the year,
and neither of them will go into the schoolyard without the other.
They walk in together, hand-in-hand. Anna is an SK and a good
head taller than Cordelia. She's very quiet; we had her over for
a playdate and Cordelia was in charge, telling her what to do
and when. She was so proud to be the authority.</p>
<p>Cordelia is in swimming class this term. She and Delphine take
half-hour classes, first Delphine then Cordelia, so DeeDee hangs
out with me by the pool while Delphine has her class. She makes me
draw pictures made of shapes, and then she has to count the shapes.
Then I draw her name in bubble writing and she colours it in.
(When Cordelia has her class, Delphine and I each read our books.)</p>
<hr>
<p>Today when I picked Cordelia up from school she was crying. I
know enough not to ask what was wrong right up front: she has
to get some of her crying out before she can talk to me.
But her sobs didn't seem to be slowing down, so I asked anyway,
and she said she hurt her head. I tried to figure out how
she had hurt her head, presenting various possible scenarios—did
you trip and run into the wall? Did someone push you?—until
she agreed with one. She said she had slipped and fallen into the
wall. I didn't see any bumps or scrapes but I was appropriately
sympathetic. We picked up Delphine and headed over to Tanya's
place, where we have lunch every day.</p>
<p>But just as we got to Tanya's Cordelia started crying again—sobbing!
I knew if she'd only bumped her head it would have been forgotten
by now, so I asked if something bad had happened at school. She
nodded, and after further questioning I got her to say that
someone had hurt her, but she wouldn't specify how. She was really
miserable, and eventually (after the retching started)
I realized that the problem was actually that she was sick. She
was nauseous and had a headache—the whole story about someone
hurting her and her bumping her head was just her trying to explain
to herself why her head hurt. She's never had a headache before!
Nonetheless, she insisted on a bandage, so in addition to acetaminophen
inside her, she had a nice big bandage plastered over her forehead.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this was the progression of her illness: headache,
cry, nap on mummy, puke, cry, rest on mummy, puke, rest in stroller
(with Otis next to her looking very dubious), watch Dora,
sleep on bathroom floor, sleep on couch, wake
up, take acetaminophen, watch Backyardigans, better! The whole
thing took less than five hours.</p>
<hr>
<p>Cordelia's nicknames: DeeDee, Boo, Cordeliaboo, Cordeli-bum,
Bootle, Chuckles, Bubbles.  Her teacher calls her Cordie.</p>

<p>Blake has been away for two weeks on business. It's the first time he's
ever been away for more than a couple of nights, and before he left
I was worried
that it would be impossible and miserable to manage by myself.</p>
<p>Blake's coming home tonight, and his absence has taught me a few things:</p>
<p><strong>Blake doesn't do much around the house</strong>. I've suspected this for a long
time, but now I'm sure. I didn't perceive <em>any</em> change in the amount of
housework or childcare I do from when he was here to when he wasn't.
Obviously this sucks and has to change. I get that he has a job and
earns all the money, but I work hard too and I think everyone should
help out at home, I don't want my children growing up thinking
that housework is women's work, and I can't do any kind of freelance
work or self-improvement if I'm spending all my time doing other
people's scut work.</p>
<p>Sorry, that turned out to be kind of a rant, didn't it?</p>
<p>Anyway, that led me quite smoothly to realization number two:
<strong>I don't need him</strong>. Obviously I love him, and of course
we need his healthy income.
What I mean is I don't need him to keep the house and family running:
I can manage by myself. This is tremendously empowering. I was
honestly worried that somehow everything would fall apart without
Blake here. That <em>I</em> would fall apart without him. (Yes, apparently
being married has turned me into a jelly.)</p>
<p>This leads, somewhat less directly, to the next realization:
<strong>I still want him around.</strong> We've been married for ten years,
and we're attached to each other through this house, through
the children, and through habit. Sometimes it seems like all those things
are doing the work of keeping us together, and the spark and
affection which brought us together in the first place
has become irrelevant. </p>
<p>I'm trying to write about this without making it sound like I've
been plotting a divorce. I swear I haven't, I love being married
to Blake and we're always going to be awesome together. But for
a while there it looked like we were together because I didn't 
have any choice. Now that I know I have a choice, however hypothetical,
it makes it much more satisfying to be together. It means we're
here because we want to be—because we like each other—not 
because it's the only option.</p>
<p>Here's another thing I learned: <strong>I don't do housework 
either</strong>. I never thought I was doing housework for Blake's benefit,
but the house has gotten slightly more disheveled than usual in the
last two weeks. It's not so much that I'm cleaning <em>for</em> Blake—I
don't think he could care less. It's more that having another adult
around adds a level of accountability that keeps me honest. If I can
get away with it, I don't clean. Good
thing I had company today: at least the main floor and the bathroom
are clean.</p>
<p>I noticed is that I'm a lot happier to do the housework
I <em>do</em> do when I don't have someone to resent for not doing it instead.
I think once we've worked out some kind of respectable chore schedule
I'll be much happier to do <em>my</em> jobs, secure in the knowledge that
I'm not doing <em>all</em> the jobs.</p>
<p>Last one: <strong>it's nice to be the only decision-maker</strong>. Not so 
nice that I'd
want to do it all the time, but there is something about not
having to discuss everything: meals, plans, jobs, whose turn it is 
in the shower, all that chatter and negotiation. It's not
something that bothers me normally, but it's nice when it's not
there, like the silence when the power goes out.  </p>
<p>Tonight the silence ends and we get our man back. I wasn't happy
to see him go, but I'll be very happy to have him back, with a
little wisdom under my belt.</p>

<p>Since last week we've been continuing the pleasantifying
of mornings, and with one little hiccup yesterday, I think it's working.</p>
<p>To review, this is how it goes: we get up and have breakfast together,
then I go and shower and leave the children the following list:</p>
<ol>
<li>two trips to the kitchen</li>
<li>pack snack</li>
<li>get dressed</li>
<li>brush teeth</li>
<li>brush hair</li>
</ol>
<p>To which Delphine inevitably adds a sixth item: Play. I think
they're finally understanding that Play can only come after (and
if) every other thing is done.</p>
<p><a href="http://nurturestore.co.uk/">Cathy</a> suggested creating
a colourful chart listing the morning routine, but Delphine is
text-oriented and a list nerd like me, so the staid
to-do list format works for her. I write a new list every day, and
she solemnly X'es off the things she's finished. It works for both
girls, even though Cordelia doesn't read yet, because
Delphine's essentially in charge of Cordelia in the morning, and Cordelia
doesn't mind. (Your mileage may vary.)</p>
<p>Yesterday I didn't include "brush hair" on the list, and when I 
announced "we have to leave in five minutes" Delphine rashly 
concluded they had time to play because they were "almost done". 
Cordelia came downstairs with every intention of playing and
justly rebelled when I said I had to brush her hair first.
She dug her heels in and I lost my temper and hollered at them.
I'm not sure why I took it so badly—could be that I
didn't get enough sleep, or I was worried that I would miss
a 9:00 appointment.
Fortunately Delphine stepped up and was the grown-up. She 
brushed Cordelia's hair and her own, and helped us all get out
of the house in good time.</p>
<p>Today our morning went smooth as butter: I didn't leave anything
off the list, and the children didn't muck about. We arrived
at school in plenty of time, with no shouting. It probably
didn't hurt that the kids were in bed early last night.</p>
<p>I should add that one of the keys to this working is that
I studiously don't care what their snacks look like (apart from
that they have to contain fruit). Today Cordelia took a little
container with some pretzel sticks and a dried apricot—no
snack bag, no drink. It's certainly not how I would do it, but I
expect it will be good enough for her, plus she has the satisfaction
of having created and packed her own snack.</p>
<p>Another thing I cultivate a lack of interest in is what the children
wear. Today Cordelia wore a black dance leotard with teal leggings,
which might just be a little too gorgeous for kindergarten. Delphine
has been dressing herself sensibly (but with 
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/2005/1125/04-w-outfit.JPG">a certain 
flair</a>) 
since forever, and fortunately she's happy
to choose Cordelia's clothes too, on the days Cordelia's not 
interested.</p>
<p>So, for now, mornings are a success story. As the girls grow and the
dynamic between them changes, I guess our mornings will change too,
and of course the success of mornings will depend on how well-rested
we all are, but for now I'm happy that we have laid the groundwork
for a functional start to the day.</p>
