<p>There have been a couple of things I’ve noticed myself doing over and over
again recently, and because I’m a developer whenever I do something over
and over again, I try to find a way to automate it.</p>
<p>So I did some playing around with Mozilla’s <a href="https://builder.mozillalabs.com/">Add-on Builder</a> and came up with <a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/Work/jetpacks/">a couple of Jetpacks</a> that solved my problems.  Maybe
you’ll find them useful, too.</p>

<p>The first sign of trouble was the brown spot on the dining room ceiling.
The dining room, as it turns out, is directly under the bathroom. I
called Drainworks and they sent a guy—earring, shirt unbuttoned
one button more than is conventional, small medallion—to have 
a look. He determined 
that the bathtub drain has a really slow leak, and he said the 
same thing the last guy
who came in to look at the last brown spot on the ceiling said: the
pipes are old. They're as old as this house, and as Chris the sexy 
plumber put it, they don't owe me anything. His thought was that the
moment anyone puts a wrench to any part of the plumbing, all those
eighty-year-old lead pipes will crumble and make a giant sloppy mess.
He suggested we talk amongst ourselves and decide whether we want
to do a patch job, just replace the pipes, or reno the whole damn bathroom.</p>
<p>So we talked, and decided to get a quote on renovating the bathroom.
We'll probably go ahead with the reno: the bathroom is really old,
and we would all love a new bathroom with a new tub and some storage space.
We're also planning to put in a cheap and tiny powder room in the basement,
which will add a whole new dimension of happiness to our mornings.</p>
<p>In the main bathroom we're replacing the ancient and not 
particularly fancy clawfoot
tub with a deep rectangular tub, and we'll replace the newish, expensive
faux-Victorian faucet with something sleek, modern and easy to clean, with
a handle up high so you don't have to bend over to adjust it, and a 
handheld shower for rinsing little girls.</p>
<p>We're keeping the toilet (we bought it when we moved in) and putting a
wall between the tub and the toilet so you can't see the toilet when
the bathroom door is open.</p>
<p>We're going to move the
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/2006/0927/10-w-sink.jpg">old sink</a>
down to the basement powder room, but when it's down there we'll replace the 
newish, expensive faux-Victorian faucet with something 
<a href="http://www.pricepfister.com/bath/Product/042-YP0C.aspx">cooler,
easier to clean, but still kinda old-timey</a>. Upstairs we're going
to put in a shallow, wide rectangular trough sink (no picture because I 
can't find the kind of thing I want anywhere on the whole entire 
Internet) with two 
<a href="http://www.pricepfister.com/bath/Product/042-VGCC.aspx">faucets</a>.
We're also going to have a proper vanity and a giant mirror, and
whatever storage our designer can cram in.</p>
<p>The floor and walls will be white ceramic tile, and we'll put radiant
heat under the floor for wintertime post-shower happy toes.</p>
<p>It's all going to be rather awesome (and probably awesomely expensive)
and I'm quite excited. It will be nice to have at least one room in the
house be slick and modern and cool.</p>
<p>And I'll take lots of pictures.</p>

<p><strong>Cordelia:</strong> I can't decide if I should marry Charlie [her newborn cousin] or 
Otis!<br><strong>Me:</strong> I think you should marry Otis, because Charlie is already related to 
you.<br><strong>Cordelia:</strong> (Thinks about it.) But Otis doesn't like kissing, and kissing 
is how you get married! </p>

<p>I've been in a bit of a dinner rut lately, just cooking the same old
things from memory night after night. Fortunately for the whole family,
a few good recipes have fallen into my life lately. Here is the story of
one dinner which led to another, and then another.</p>
<p><strong>Dinner One: Asian-inspired Salmon Burgers</strong></p>
<p>This first recipe is from <em>Not Your Mother's Weeknight Cooking</em>
by Beth Hensperger. The same author co-wrote <em>Not Your Mother's
Slow Cooker Cookbook</em>, which is a frequently-used title on my
cookbook shelf. The recipe is actually for Tuna Burgers, but of course 
I messed with it. Here it is:</p>
<p><strong>Wasabi Mayo</strong><br>
3 green onions<br>
one 1½ inch chunk of fresh ginger<br>
2 tsp soy sauce<br>
2 tsp wasabi powder (I used European horseradish)<br>
½ cup mayonnaise<br></p>
<p><strong>Burgers</strong><br>
3 green onions<br>
one 1½ inch chunk of fresh ginger<br>
1 to 1¼ pounds tuna steaks (I used frozen salmon fillets because I am <em>so</em> cheap)<br>
¼ cup cold unsalted butter, cut into chunks (OMG genius!!!)<br>
2 tbsp soy sauce<br>
2 tsp sesame oil<br>
few grinds of freshly ground black pepper<br>
4 buns (I actually ended up making eight burgers)<br>
Butter lettuce leaves (hah - I found some old romaine at the back of the fridge)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To make the mayo, blend all the ingredients together. I actually just
chopped up the choppable stuff and mixed it together, and it was fine.
Stick it all in a bowl and put it in the fridge while you make the burgers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chop up or food-process the green onions and ginger. Cut one quarter of
the tuna into ¼ inch cubes, and put the rest into the food processor 
with the butter and the onions and ginger. Pulse to combine. 
(Pause to marvel at the notion of mixing
the butter <em>right into</em> the burger, and how it completely destroys any
healthful properties of the fish. Oh, but it's going to be so good.) Put
it all in a bowl and mix it with the diced fish and the soy sauce, sesame oil,
and pepper. Shape into four equal-size patties. (As I said, I made eight
little ones.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preheat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Brown patties for three
minutes on the first side and three to four on the other, until done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serve patties on buns with wasabi mayo and lettuce.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Yum! We loved them.</p>
<p><strong>Dinner Two: Couscous Salad</strong></p>
<p>My friend Tanya makes couscous salad all the time: couscous, parsley,
diced red pepper, cucumber, celery, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, 
olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. It's delicious and it keeps
and travels well. Inspired by that, I used the leftover mayo to make
my own version with couscous, soy beans, broccoli, and grated carrot.
Another delicious hit.</p>
<p><strong>Dinner Three: Mini Frittatas</strong></p>
<p>I've been getting ParentsCanada magazine lately—against my will; it
comes with Cordelia's Chirp magazine—and while I'm still sitting on 
the fence as to its usefulness as a parenting magazine, I do seem to clip 
recipes out of every single issue that shows up in my mailbox. This month
they had lunchbox recipes, and one of them was for little frittatas baked
in muffin cups. Here's their recipe:</p>
<p><strong>Mini Frittatas</strong></p>
<p>2 cups filling: cooked and chopped vegetables, torn fresh herbs, cooked 
spaghetti, cooked crumbled sausage, ham or bacon, shredded roast chicken or 
a combination of any of these<br>
5-6 large eggs<br>
¼ cup milk<br>
½ cup freshly grated Parmesan, cheddar, or other cheese<br>
salt and pepper to taste</p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 375°F<br>
</li>
<li>Sauté raw veggies (if you're using them in your filling) so they
don't release liquid in the frittatas and make them soggy<br>
</li>
<li>In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, milk and salt and pepper
to taste. Add your fillings and if you like, some grated or crumbled
cheese.<br>
</li>
<li>Divide the mixture among muffin tins that have been sprayed with nonstick 
spray and sprinkle with grated cheese.<br>
</li>
<li>Bake for 15-20 minutes, until puffed and golden. (I actually baked
it for ten or fifteen minutes longer—they wouldn't brown for me.) 
Serve warm for dinner 
or cool completely before packing up for lunch.<br>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So I followed that recipe, using about 1¾ cups of the couscous
salad from the day before as the filling, along with a can of tuna. They
turned out awesome. The kids love them and I
will totally be making this recipe for lunches.</p>
<p>So there you go: tuna burgers → couscous salad → frittatas.
Yum.</p>

<p>As summer draws to an end the girls and I are trying to squeeze the last of
the fun out of the season. One of the last things on the list we came up with
at the beginning of the year was to go to the Harbourfront, and that is
what we did today.</p>
<p>As usual we got off to a late start—between brushing hair and applying
sunblock and looking for Playmobil horses and TTC tokens we didn't 
leave the house until around ten. When we got down to the Harbourfront
the first order of business (after saying goodbye to the crowds of people
headed for the Ex) was to find money. Unfortunately RBC has a lock
on Queen's Quay Terminal, so we wandered westward searching for a TD
bank machine. On the way we saw: a camp "canoeing" (more being
pushed about) on Natrel pond; Delphine's canoe camp (she showed us the
giant canoe they all went out to Centre Island in); the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_Bridge,_Toronto">Amsterdam
Bridge</a>; the 
<a href="http://www.torontopedia.ca/Spadina_Wave_Deck">Spadina wave deck</a>; 
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTO_Park">HtO Park</a>. HtO Park is basically a giant
sandbox with big metal umbrellas and Muskoka chairs—we couldn't
decide if it was cool or lame, but Delphine liked the shower/footbath.</p>
<p>At that point it was apparent that we wouldn't find a TD bank machine anywhere,
so we headed back to Queen's Quay Terminal (via the 
<a href="http://www.landezine.com/?p=993">Simcoe wave deck</a>) where I
paid $1.50 for the privilege of taking money out of an RBC machine.</p>
<p>Next on the itinerary was to buy tickets for a boat ride. We went with
Mariposa Boat Cruises because they were the first kiosk we came to, and
Cordelia rode for free. It was 12:00 so I bought tickets for the 1:30 ride
to give us time to get lunch. After pondering Il Fornello and an 
Irish pub, we decided to economize, and had chicken fingers, fish and
chips, and a tuna sandwich at a grill-type place. Then back to Queen's Quay
Terminal where we got an ice cream cone just in time to take it on the
boat.</p>
<p>We rode on the 
<a href="http://www.mariposacruises.com/our-fleet-oriole.php">Oriole</a>
(not quite as glamourous, in the harsh light of day, as they make it sound)
and made ourselves at home on the lower deck, with only the bartender
for company. I love the harbourfront boat tours—you get to go around
the island lagoon, see the yachts, the bird sanctuary, the 
<a href="http://www.toronto.ca/parks/island/lighthouse.htm">Gibraltar Point
Lighthouse</a>, and of course the city from the other side. The
girls loved it too, although Delphine had trouble keeping up with the
tour guide's descriptions of buildings: "Between the two white buildings
you'll see a tall gold building..." "Which one is it, Mama? I can't see it."
By the time I described it again, of course, it was out of sight. Cordelia
probably just couldn't make sense of it at all and was enjoying the ride
on her own terms. It's good to be four.</p>
<p>A few things bothered me about the information given out in the
tour. They talked about the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto-Dominion_Centre">TD Centre</a> 
but they didn't mention it
was designed by Mies van der Rohe; they talked about 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Canadian_Place">First Canadian
Place</a> but they didn't mention it by name (they called it the Bank of 
Montreal building) and they didn't say why it has scaffolding at the top; they
called Canada geese "Canadian geese" which is a neologism which drives
me crazy; and finally (is that all?!) they said the CN in CN Tower stands
for "Canada's National". Which is just stupid, although according to
this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CN_Tower">Wikipedia page</a> not
entirely wrong.</p>
<p>After the tour we visited what Delphine calls the Lemming Ball, for reasons
I will leave to her to explain when she has a blog. It's a giant, hollow
cement sphere which you can walk into through a wooden ramp. It is
surprisingly underdocumented on the Internet (or else I am searching wrong)
and you'd have to see it to really understand. The girls thought it was
really cool; I was too busy Twittering about two old people sitting on
a nearby bench making out like teenagers.</p>
<p>Next we charged over to Yonge Street (in the hot hot sun) in search 
of the Royal York Hotel. Those
of you who are smarter than me will be saying, "Hey, isn't the Royal
York on Bay Street?" As it turns out, it is, so we charged over to
Yonge Street, walked under the Gardiner (boo, hiss) and then (once
I realized my mistake) charged
back west on Front Street until we finally reached the elegantly
air conditioned Royal York. I thought the girls would be impressed
by the shiny old-school, dimly lit, brass-and-Persian-carpets luxury
of it, and so they were. They also immediately quieted down and behaved
like princesses as soon as we got inside; to the manner born, they are.</p>
<p>We found a fancy hotel restroom and took our time freshening up, and 
then I impulsively suggested that we go to 
<a href="http://www.epicrestaurant.ca/">Epic</a> for drinks. The
maitre d' was busy on the phone helping someone plan his (or her) proposal
dinner, so we found ourselves a table and ordered lemonade for Cordelia,
a Shirley Temple for Delphine and iced tea for me. (That's "drinks" when
you travel with a four-year-old and a seven-year-old.) The drinks came with
an elegant silver bowl of not-entirely-elegant snack mix: beer nuts, 
wasabi peas, cheese crackers, and sesame chips. It was delightfully
refreshing, all the more so because for some reason they only charged
us for my drink. I guess it pays to be really cute.</p>
<p>On the way home we intersected with about a million cranky TDSB teachers
TTCing home from 
<a href="http://www.tdsb.on.ca/microsites/believe_it//about.asp">Spence-a-palooza</a> with their unwanted green tote bags. It's interesting to see how
many teachers live in our neighbourhood—there were at least four
on our bus alone.</p>
<p>(I may have inadvertently insulted our French/gym teacher within his
earshot. I was talking to an acquaintance, also a teacher, and saying I
wished we had a proper gym teacher at our school; the kids either get
a non-gym teacher who happens to be free at the right time, or they
get M. Landry who is half gym, half French, but his heart is really in 
the French classroom. However, what I actually said
was "M. Landry is just an angry French teacher", which is, I believe,
an accurate characterization. As I said it a guy sitting nearby kind
of smirked, and when he got off the bus at our stop he was talking
to his friend in a French accent. So, oops, maybe.)</p>
<p>Then we were home and I sent the children off to play at a neighbour's
house while I took a few minutes to relax. It was a great day—I
love exploring the city with my kids, they are such good company. (Even
when they pick and snipe at each other all day as they have been lately.)</p>
<p>Tomorrow they're going for back-to-school haircuts and then we'll hit
the library and the park, if it isn't raining.</p>

<p>As someone who works on an email client, I’m interested in making
my communications more secure.  So, with the assistance of
<a href="http://perso.hirlimann.net/~ludo/blog/">Ludovic</a> and
<a href="http://gozer.ectoplasm.org/blog/">Gozer</a>, I got a client certificate that
would allow me to sign and encrypt my messages.  (Check out the envelope
and lock in the image below.)</p>
<p><img alt="An outgoing message, with an envelope and a
lock" src="images/blake/SignedAndEncrypted.png" title="Signed and Encrypted"></p>
<p>Most of the time, I’ll probably just sign my messages – after all, that’s
what I’ve set it up to do by default – but it’s nice to know that if
there’s something I need to encrypt, that option is now available to me.</p>

<p>It doesn't seem to matter how much other stuff I have going on, I always
have time to read. Don't have time to blog, don't have time to work, 
definitely don't have time to houseclean—still have time to
read.</p>
<p><strong><em>Science, Sense and Nonsense</em></strong> <strong>by Joe Schwarcz</strong> is a collection of
commentaries on chemistry in everyday life, with a side of fraud-spotting
advice. The book covers antioxidants, trans fats, historical alternatives 
to rubber, and a wealth of other topics serious and amusing.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Devil's Arithmetic</em></strong> <strong>by Jane Yolen</strong> is a young adult book
about a modern girl who, bored with her family Seder, is transported back
in time to 1941 Poland. I guess maybe the only thing worse than being a
Jew in Poland in 1941 is being a Jew in Poland in 1941 who knows the future.
She and her entire village are sent to a concentration camp where they
fight to survive and to retain their humanity. This book has won a heap
of awards (and I just found out it was made into a movie with Kirsten
Dunst and Brittany Murphy) and it is a wonderful story about the importance
of remembering.</p>
<p>I read <strong><em>The Root Cellar</em></strong> <strong>by Janet Lunn</strong> out loud to Delphine.
It's another time travel book, about a girl who is left alone when
her grandmother dies. She is packed off to live with relatives in rural
Ontario and is lonely and miserable until she discovers that the 
root cellar takes her back in time to the 1860s, where she makes friends
and feels more at home than in the present. Her twin challenges are to
track down a friend who doesn't return from the American civil war (in
the past) and to find a place for herself in her new family (in the
present). I loved this book when
I was a child, and Delphine liked it this time around, as did I.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shakespeare: The World as a Stage</em></strong> <strong>by Bill Bryson</strong> is a
short biography of Shakespeare—short because we don't really know
much about the playwright. In addition to what little we do know, 
Bryson covers disproved (or unlikely)
theories and myths. As always, readable and informative.</p>
<p><strong><em>The History of Love</em></strong> <strong>by Nicole Krauss</strong> was a book club book.
It's about old man who feels like he is disappearing; his long-lost
son, a famous novelist; a teenage girl named Alma whose mother is
translating a book which turns out was written by... well, you'll have
to read it yourself. It's one of those books where the stories go
along in parallel and you have to try and figure out how they're connected
before the end when the author ties everything together with a big
bow. It was a lovely book; I enjoyed reading it, although in book
club we decided you have to read it in big chunks or you'll get 
too confused.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Unfinished Angel</em></strong> <strong>by Sharon Creech</strong> is a... young adult?
Middle grade? I never know—although I'll have to figure it out pretty
soon because I'm helping a friend with her middle-grade novel this fall—
Anyway, it's a book about an angel whose quiet life in a tower is 
interrupted by the arrival of a girl who changes everything in the
village. The book is written in the childlike voice of the angel, which
sounds a little cringe-y, but Sharon Creech is a phenomenal writer and
she makes it work. This is only a short book and it goes quickly, but 
it's well worth reading.</p>

<p>A co-worker of mine was having problems remembering where the <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/client.mk">makefile</a> puts the binary for
<a href="http://mozillamessaging.com/">Thunderbird</a> when you build it yourself.
Now, I type in the path far too often, so I know where it is (on my
computer, anyways), but since I type it in far too often, I grabbed
someone's <a href="http://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a> function that launched <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/">Firefox</a>, and modified it to launch Thunderbird from either
the build directory or the source directory, but only on Mac OS X.</p>
<p>Anyways, here it is, I hope some of you find it useful.</p>
