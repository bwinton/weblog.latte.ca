<h4>
<a href="http://grbmozilla.wordpress.com/">Daniel</a>’s QuickLook Support</h4>
<p>There’s <a href="http://bitbucket.org/libras2909/qlplugin/src">an extension</a>
which adds QuickLook support to Thunderbird.  To run correctly, it needs
a patch to msgHdrOverlay (included in the repo).</p>
<p>The extension is also packaged as a set of changes to Thunderbird, which
you can find <a href="http://bitbucket.org/libras2909/ql-enabler/src">over here</a>.  Daniel is working on testing those changes and then turning them
into a patch which we can review, and eventually add to Thunderbird.
For now, the changes to Thunderbird need to go in a qlxpcom subdirectory
under mailnews/extensions, and there are two diffs which need to be
applied.  See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=457546">bug 457546</a> for updates.</p>
<h4>
<a href="http://ilienert.wordpress.com/">Ian</a>’s Improved Attachment Handling</h4>
<p>Ian decided that the easiest way forward on this would be to concentrate
on the <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/users/bwinton_latte.ca/dataminers/summary">DataMiners</a>
extension.  He did all of his work in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ilienert/dataminers/src">a fork</a> on BitBucket, but it has
since been pulled into the official repository.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m quite happy with the amount of work they both put in, and am looking
forward to seeing them continue to develop their projects in the future.</p>

<p>I've always been a walker. Lots of people are, and I don't have anything
new to say about walking, apart from that I like to do it. I like the
pace, I like looking at things as I walk, I like the scale of walking.</p>
<p>I don't like to run. Well, I like some things about it: I like that it's
good exercise, that it's pretty easy to do (logistically if not 
athletically), that it generates lots of geeky data. But I don't like
actually doing it. And it turns out I don't have the self-discipline
to sustain a habit which I don't enjoy, even though it's good for me.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I like walking. And walking is good for me too. I suppose
aerobically it's not as good as running, but biomechanically it's
almost certainly better. And mentally it's beyond compare. So I'm going to
stop berating myself for not running, and start walking. (It's part
of a grander intention to stop berating myself for not being what
I'm not – ambitious, tireless – and start working with what 
I am – smart, affable, orderly.)</p>
<p>My grander plan is to walk a half-marathon. I haven't decided which one
yet – probably in the spring. I figure it's do-able; I'm pretty 
sure I walked 21K in a day 
back when I was touring Europe (13 years ago – shut up!) I suppose
I could set myself some kind of time goal, but see above re: ambitious, not.</p>
<p>I'm going to walk 5K on Tuesdays and Thursdays and 
10K on Sunday mornings. I'll kill two birds
with one stone by listening to audiobooks (or really awesome music) while
I'm walking.</p>
<p>It's going to be great! This is the best plan ever.</p>

<p>Tonight's the first choir practice of the 2010-2011 season, and I'm
uncommonly excited. It's entirely misplaced excitement because at the 
first practice we don't sing – we pick up music, pay dues, and
then there's a (honestly rather lame) cheese and wine thing. I'm
not interested in wine, the cheese is usually not very good, and
me and the choir have developed a kind of polite disinterest in 
becoming friends. The two people in choir who I'm friends with, I'm
friends with outside choir. Otherwise, there are a few other people 
I quite like,
but the rest of the choir (including the director) doesn't seem nearly 
as interested in me as I feel they should be, and as such I'm not 
moved to be interested in them. I would far (far, far) rather sing
with them than talk to them. So the first meeting of the choir is
a bust for me, apart from that I get to see my friend Janet (Kat is
away) and go to <a href="http://www.xococava.ca/">Xococava</a>.</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/lauridsen.jpg" align="right" title="Morten Lauridsen: Isn't he lovely?" alt="Morten Lauridsen">
Anyway, that aside, I'm beside myself with excitement about this
season's repertoire. Mainly 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Lauridsen">Morten
Lauridsen</a>'s <em>Lux Aeterna</em>, which is subtle and gorgeous and 
completely doesn't play to our strengths, which are mainly being 
loud and getting it over with quickly. The <em>Lux Aeterna</em> has lots 
of sustained, soft,
high passages, so we are going to have to work really hard to stay
on pitch. Without sounding like we're working hard, of course.</p>
<p>We're also doing <em>Messiah</em> (snore), Mozart's Requiem which is good fun
except for the parts which aren't Mozart, and Mendelssohn's <em>Elijah</em>
which has some lovely parts and some very forgettable parts. (I'm 
listening to the recording of the last
time we performed it and I just heard the creaking of one of those 
cheap folding chairs. Ouch.)</p>
<p>I feel like I've lost my singing voice a little in the last few years.
I took voice lessons for a couple of years before Delphine was born and
my singing voice was a revelation to me – making such a fantastic
sound (she said modestly) so effortlessly was a thrill like I've never
known. I should emphasise that my voice isn't so incredibly beautiful –
it's just that I can sing much higher and more competently than I 
<em>thought</em> I would be able to – turns out singing high isn't hard 
work, it's all
in the technique. Anyway, that was then, but since I stopped
taking lessons (and stopped warming up properly and practicing, let's
be honest) my high notes have become less confident (and less high) and
my breath control, which was never great, has become even worse.</p>
<p>So this season I want to work on my high register, breath control, and
also listening – I'm terrible for getting caught up in my own
singing and not listening to the rest of the choir. I will get to work
on that when I'm working with the school junior choir, too. I'm not sure
how I'm going to work on the other things – for a while there I
was signed up for a vocal technique workshop, but it was cancelled. I can't
afford private lessons. I will have to poke around…</p>

<p>So I'm trying out <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> to 
track the books I've read (as well as the ones I'd like to read, apparently
a much longer list). I still have a huge backlog of 2010 books I want
to log/blog/review, but I just reviewed <strong><em>The Intimate Adventures of a London 
Call Girl</em></strong> <strong>by Belle de Jour</strong> over on Goodreads. Until I can figure
out how and whether the great unwashed (that's you guys) can read my
Goodreads reviews I'm just going to copy and paste the review here:</p>
<p>I first heard of Belle de Jour when she was interviewed for New 
Scientist magazine after "coming out". She blogged and published anonymously about her life as a call girl in London for several years before revealing her full identity - in addition to her sex work she was also working as a post-doc in genetic epidemiology. (Hence the New Scientist interview - Google "new scientist belle de jour" for the interview.)</p>
<p>Truth be told, I'm probably more interested in reading about genetic epidemiology than sex (geek!), but I have been watching the TV adaptation of Belle's diaries, largely because it stars Billie Piper, late of Doctor Who (geek!). I'm really enjoying the show, so I thought I might as well read the book to complete the picture.</p>
<p>I didn't find the Belle in the book as likeable as Billie Piper's Belle, but I expect the TV producers did that on purpose - an unrepentant call-girl is a bit of a tough sell as a protagonist, so they needed someone as charming and loveable as Piper to pull it off. I enjoyed seeing London through the perspective of a prostitute, and I enjoyed (I'll be honest) her descriptions of all the sex she had, both professional and social. I read more than my fair share of sex newsgroups as a teenager, so most of the details weren't news to me (except that apparently you can get a dildo shaped like a dolphin's penis - who knew!) but it's been a while since I acquainted myself with the world of the vigorously sexually-active.</p>
<p>Sometimes the book read like a blog - occasionally a chapter (titled with the date in French - why?) would simply relate a casual (non-sexual) encounter with a homeless person or charity campaigner. I didn't see the point of most of those. And there was a lot of pointless boyfriend drama which could have made a whole other book - or enriched this one - if it had dramatized with an arc and character development, but when reported as a succession of events was frustrating and ultimately pointless.  (Not unlike actual boyfriend drama in actual real life.)</p>
<p>Those quibbles aside, this was an enjoyable and enlightening read.</p>
<hr>
<p>Incidentally, I am right now listening to "You Know I'm No Good" by Amy
Winehouse, which features an awesome little brass riff in the middle which
is used in the Call Girl TV Show. It's all connected.</p>

<p>Back in 2007 we <a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/2007/0731/">had a new
deck built</a>, and to celebrate we threw a party and invited all our
coolest friends. It was an awesome party so we've done one every year
since, and this year's was today. Of course I forgot to take pictures
as usual, so don't hold your breath for the picture post.</p>
<p>We invited about 40 people (plus kids) to the first one, and the
number has increased every year since – this year we invited
about 75. Most of them didn't make it, though, and we
probably ended up with about 30 plus nine kids, a thirteen-month-old
and a six-week-old (Charlie!) So it wasn't the giant hoedown it
has been in the past, but on the other hand I managed to hang out
with everyone for at least a little while.</p>
<p>Blake thinks we broke even on beer; people always bring beer and we
seem to have the same amount now that we had this morning. We're also
up one pot of flowers and a jar of caramelized red onion relish (NOM!)
We also have piles of leftover party food: cheese, crackers, ketchup
chips (no-one likes ketchup chips!), and various frozen hors d'oeuvres.
That's what we'll be eating for the next couple of weeks – that
and Ontario peaches and apples.</p>

<p>Most of the day was okay. Neither Blake nor I were in the best
of moods, but we dealt and got on with things. We're having our
big deck party tomorrow so I had a bunch of housework-y things to do,
but I didn't feel like doing them and procrastinated most of the day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Blake got this new superfast hard drive thing he was really
excited about, and spent the rest of the afternoon failing to get it
to work with his computer.</p>
<p>My plan was to take the girls to the library after school and then pick 
up fish and chips for dinner. However about three metres outside the
school door they started pick pick picking at each other, and when Delphine
shoved Cordelia I informed them that we were not going to the library
and we would just eat whatever rubbish was in the fridge. Then I stormed
home and they followed me all "wah wah, you're walking too fast". I
was SO MAD. </p>
<p>On the way home I decided <em>fuck this, <strong>I</strong> want to go to the library</em>.
So I dropped the girls off at the end of the block with strict instructions
to go to their rooms and not bother Daddy, and then I charged off to
the library. Stomp stomp stomp.</p>
<p>I spent most of the walk to the library trying to call and text Blake
to make sure the girls got home okay and that he knew the situation.
I finally got through and he told me he'd been talking to the girls.
Or Talking To the girls. I'm sure Delphine gave him a pretty good
recap so he had the information he needed to handle it.</p>
<p>It's a good thing I went to the library because there were seven (7)
things on hold for me: two audiobooks, a CD, and four books including
<em>Your Seven-Year-Old: Life in a Minor Key</em> (no shit!) I picked up
fish and chips anyway because I didn't want to cook, and went home to
find the girls had set the table and tidied up for me. They were being
very nice to me and each other, and for an hour or so everything was good.</p>
<p>Then the girls bashed their heads together while spinning on the swings.
Cordelia sustained the blow toward the back of her head, and Delphine
on her temple. Despite the obvious physical impossibility, it seemed
like Delphine got the worst of the collision – Cordelia cried for
a while and then was fine, but Delphine was dizzy and sick, had a
headache so bad it made her cry and blurred vision in her left eye. The 
headache and nausea carried on through dinner, until she puked and 
then everything seemed to feel better. (How does that work? It works
for me with migraines too.)</p>
<p>Now she's asleep and I'm reading about concussions and Mild Traumatic
Brain Injury and second-guessing myself. Should we have gone to a clinic?
Should we have called the doctor? (Hah. As if you can "call" the doctor.)
I'll check on her tonight and keep an eye on her tomorrow, and try and
get her to rest. (Maybe a lot of TV?)</p>
<p>Hopefully tomorrow will go better.</p>

<p>Now that I have a walking-around camera (ie, the camera in my phone)
I don't have to look at random plants and say, "hey, that's cool, I
wonder what it is." I can take pictures and post them here and ask
everyone!</p>
<p>So what is this stuff with the little round pink and orange flower 
heads?</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/100909/pinkPuffy.jpg"></p>
<p>How about this red flower with big leaves?</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/100909/redSpiky.jpg"></p>
<p>I've seen this squashy-looking thing with white trumpet-shaped
flowers all over the place:</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/100909/whiteTrumpets.jpg"></p>
<p>I also like this grass with flat seedheads:</p>

<p>Let me start by saying the girls both had a wonderful day back
at school. Delphine loves her teacher and her classroom, Cordelia
loves her teacher ("she didn't frown all day!") and daycare. Everyone
was all smiles at lunchtime and after school when I picked them up.</p>
<p>The rot started to set in when we were walking home. When Cordelia said she
did something cool in class, Delphine said, "That's stupid." Cordelia
yanked on Delphine's backpack and pulled her off-balance. When 
Cordelia said she did something for the first time, Delphine 
said, "Anyone can do that." Cordelia pulled on Delphine's 
backpack, Cordelia tried to get between
Delphine and Blake... Just, on and on and on. </p>
<p>Finally, at the end of dinner, Cordelia talked about how she
learned recorder in daycare, and Delphine said she was jealous and
she wanted to be in daycare because she never learns anything good. 
Then there was something about Cordelia getting more jello, and someone
said "meh meh meeeh". (That was Delphine.)</p>
<p>And I said, "I'm sick of both of you. Go. Go to bed."</p>
<p>There were shocked looks, and looks of disbelief, and crying
and supplication. Cordelia said, "I don't know how to put myself to
bed!" Blake said, "I can tell you: go upstairs, put on your pajamas, 
brush your
teeth, read yourself a book, and tuck yourself in." "But I don't
know how to read!" "Then you're going to have to find someone who
can read to you."</p>
<p>Delphine got herself together pretty quickly – she loves 
having to step up and be responsible. If we made her move out next week
she'd probably make out just fine.</p>
<p>Cordelia is more persistent and more invested in getting us to do
things for her – she is not embracing independence. She 
cried for someone to read her a book for ages, to no avail: it was
just like sleep training all over again. After a while Blake went
upstairs and pointed out to her that Delphine could read her a book.
Cordelia asked her to, and Delphine said okay, so Cordelia
reported to Blake: "She said she would read to me, but I don't 
want her to!" So of course Delphine decided not to read her
a book, and Cordelia cried some more.</p>
<p>Blake came downstairs and I said it's funny how quickly things
turn around – for a minute she had someone to read her a book
but she managed to fuck it up in a second by being snotty. That's a good
lesson.</p>
<hr>
<p>I knew as soon as I sent them to bed that this was not good,
democratic parenting. There is no way that having to put yourself to bed
is a reasonable consequence of being nasty to your sibling. </p>
<p>But I honestly was sick of them and I honestly was happy not to put them
to bed. I suppose I could have called the whole thing to a halt 
and explained that I made a mistake, but Cordelia would have
interpreted that as a response to her crying and carrying on.  I had 
to be more stubborn than she was.</p>
<p>Anyway, eventually Cordelia gave up crying, and put herself to bed.
Both of us went to chat with the girls, and Cordelia said to
Blake, "Will you teach me how to be a polite girl?"</p>
<p>Which is what we want to do, but of course sending them to bed without
a book is not the way to do it. That's either punishment or pettiness,
and either way will do nothing to help the girls get along with each 
other. Although
I do think it sent a message about how much it bothers me when they
pick at each other, for what that's worth.</p>
<p>So I suppose it's back to <em>Siblings Without Rivalry</em>, and maybe it's 
time for me to take a look at how I treat the girls. Most of the
fighting is instigated by Delphine – Cordelia will overtly (usually
physically)
try and horn in when Delphine is getting attention, but it's
mainly Delphine who is scornful and spiteful. </p>
<p>It's hard
to treat two such different people equally, and I think I might be
warmer and friendlier with Cordelia because she's such a fun
and bubbly person. And because Delphine is older (and thus we expect
more of her) and also tends to be absent-minded, I think we correct
and criticise her more. My hypothesis is that Delphine picks at Cordelia because
she wants to show us that she's good too. It's time to ramp up the
affection and patience with Delphine, and ease up on the criticism
and correction. And also pay more attention to their fights to try 
and sort out what's going on.</p>

<p>Tomorrow's the start of the new year. No, not Rosh Hashanah (that's 
Wednesday), although Shana Tova to those of you who are into that kind
of thing. No, tomorrow is the first day of school. </p>
<p>For Cordelia that means Senior Kindergarten with a new teacher and
a whole new batch of friends. Kindergarten in Ontario is arranged
as a two-year deal, and class groupings generally stay the same—which
is to say all the JKs stay together when they move up to SK. However,
Cordelia is so advanced (or more likely so used to hanging out with
older kids) that all her friends last year were in SK.
So they're all happily off to Grade One and she doesn't
have any friends in her class yet. However, I'm sure she'll work
something out.</p>
<p>When I asked her at dinner, she said she was most excited about
meeting her new teacher. When I asked her what she was most scared about
she said, "There's nothing scary about school!"</p>
<p>Cordelia's other new big thing is that she's starting daycare. I'm
thrilled that she's in daycare, not just because it means I can
have six uninterrupted hours to myself five days a week (although
I am nearly light-headed at the thought), but because I love the 
activities, I love the structure, and I love the fact that she'll get
a healthy lunch and snacks. Frankly if she were home with me she'd
be playing video games while I fold laundry or nap on the couch—at
daycare she'll be doing music and crafts and all kinds of wonderful
things.  Cordelia's also excited about daycare. They have 
"pretty good centres", she says.</p>
<p>For Delphine, the start of school means Grade Two in a new classroom
in the basement, as part of a Grade Two/Three combined class. Her
teacher is someone I've met briefly and really liked, and she is
in the same class as her best friend. She's more than ready to
go back to school—she and Cordelia have been needling each
other for the last week.</p>
<p>I can't remember what Delphine was most excited about, but she's scared
there will be spiders in the classroom because they were using it
as a storeroom before. I said they'd probably clean it before the
first day of school.</p>
<p>For me this is also a time of great change. I'm starting work in earnest
now that I have those six uninterrupted hours five days a week.
I'm working on a publishing project at the moment, then after that
I have another editing gig lined up (I was just offered it 
the day before yesterday—whoo!)</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to working, but at dinner I said the thing I 
was scared about was that I wouldn't have time to work and do all 
the other things I do: volunteer with the school, do housework
and household maintenance, exercise (I want to start training for
a walking ½-marathon), reading. I said I'm worried I will
let someone down or mess something up or find I don't have time
for something.</p>
<p>But really, I'm not all that worried. Since having children I've
become way more efficient, and six hours is really a lot. Six hours is
a lot for one day; I literally can't imagine six hours to myself for 
five days in a row. Let alone for five days in a row for forty-two
weeks! I'll be swimming in time! I could rebuild Rome!</p>
<p>Blake says he isn't scared about anything.</p>
