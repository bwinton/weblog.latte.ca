<p>Dear Santa,</p>
<p><a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/stuff/xmasList2010.html">Everyone else</a> is
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/delphine/santa2010.html">doing it</a>, so here’s my
list, too.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Blu-Ray of a fireplace, perhaps with a secondary audio track of
  christmas music.</li>
<li>Dollhouse Season 2 on Blu-Ray.</li>
<li>Books are always nice.  I’m in the mood for one of Ian Banks' Culture
  series, but I’m not sure which ones I haven’t read.</li>
<li>Whichever Usagi Yojimbo collections I’m missing.</li>
<li>Another two (<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/cubegoodies/bbe8/?source=google_toys&amp;cpg=ogty1&amp;gclid=CO6b2MH-5qUCFU0J2godRD-TtA">or three!</a>) sets of BuckyBalls.  (I would get <a href="http://zenmagnets.com/">Zen Magnets</a>, but I’ve already got BuckyBalls, and I don’t
  think I want to mix them.</li>
<li>a digital photo frame, for the office.</li>
<li>A tiny usb <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/usb-gadgets/c609/">monitor</a>.  (There are also
  touch-screen versions for more money, but I’m a little leery about them.)</li>
<li>Perhaps an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> to play around with.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that’s all I can think of off the top of my head.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Blake.</p>

<p>I’ve created a couple of checklists, and would like to hear any feedback on
them.  They are a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Bwinton/Review_Checklist">Review Checklist</a>, and a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Bwinton/Commit_Checklist">Commit
Checklist</a>.</p>
<p>They came about after I had been working mostly on experimental add-ons for
a while, and then attempted to push a couple of reviewed fixes.  Since I
was out of practice, I managed to get something minor wrong on both of the
pushes.  (The first one failed to attribute the patch to the proper author;
The second one failed to mention the bug number in the commit message.)
Since I’m a bit of a perfectionist, this really annoyed me, and so I vowed
to write up the steps that I go through when I need to commit and push a
patch, so that I could refer to them later, since if <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/thechecklistmanifesto">checklists can save
lives</a>, then I figure they
can probably also help me do my job better.  But before I go to that, I
needed to review a patch, so I wrote up some of the things I look for when
I review a patch too.</p>

<p>I was recently modifying an add-on for the upcoming Thunderbird 3.3, and
part of what I wanted to do was to run some javascript in a chrome context
that added some DOM nodes to a document in a content context.  But when I

<p>Poking around a little, it seemed like I had reasonable things for the
<tt>insertBefore</tt> method, the <tt>firstChild</tt> attribute, and the
<tt>topBar</tt> variable, and so since it was late, and I couldn't see what
I had done wrong, I went to bed.</p>
<p>That turned out to be a the best thing for me to do, because this morning
<a href="http://blog.xulforum.org">Jonathan Protzenko</a> came to the rescue, saying
(<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.extensions/browse_thread/thread/cd6f0f02b6bc60f4#">in response to a similar problem</a>
with a Firefox 4.0 beta 7 extension):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you're modifying some content DOM from chrome code, you need to make
sure the child you're appending was created using the unprivileged
document, not the global document.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>// This is chrome code, this is wrong because the span is now chrome
// and you're trying to insert it into content
myContentNode.appendChild(document.createElement("span"))

// This is right, appending a content node to another content node
myContentNode.appendChild(myContentNode.ownerDocument.createElement("span"))
</pre>


<p>I've hit this issue at least three times when upgrading stuff for Gecko
2.0. Might be what you're looking for .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And sure enough, when I changed <tt>var topBar =
document.createElement("div");</tt> to <tt>var topBar =
doc.createElement("div");</tt>
, it all started working beautifully.</p>
<p>Thank you, Jonathan!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>
<p>I know I don't actually believe in you, and no-one buys me Christmas gifts
except my mother who doesn't have Internet access, and my husband who
refuses to buy me anything I ask for on account of "it wouldn't be
a surprise". But I'm putting this up here anyway. Just in case.</p>
<ul>
<li>I've always wanted a name necklace, and I especially like 
<a href="http://mynamenecklace.com/Product.aspx?p=2324&amp;m=334">this red
acrylic one</a>.</li>
<li>Electric pencil sharpener. I know it's not eco. I just want one.</li>
<li>Squirrel-proof bird feeder</li>
<li>Jo Malone perfume. You choose the fragrance. (Scented lotion would be 
fine too.)</li>
<li>Votive candles. Now that the children are old enough to not do anything
stupid, I've rediscovered candles. I like the expensive ones with
good quality fragrances.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.staples.ca/ENG/Catalog/cat_sku.asp?CatIds=&amp;webid=569444&amp;affixedcode=WW">24-pack ultra-fine tip Sharpies</a>. All those lovely colours.</li>
<li>Quality Street chocolate. Always welcome.</li>
<li>I'd love a clicky IBM-style keyboard. ThinkGeek 
  <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/keyboards-mice/8396/">has one</a>,
  although I'd be just as happy with one with labelled keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks in advance, Santa. Remember, I'm the house with the cookies
and <em>brandy</em>.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,<br>
Amy</p>

<p>Ten years ago (well, ten years and ten days) Blake and I got married.
Since we're still married we decided to celebrate by taking a grown-up
holiday, a weekend away. Last Friday night we left the girls with
Baba and Zaida and checked into the Novotel downtown. Our room was
on the third floor, room 314, and it was a little disappointing, to be
honest. A paltry selection of free toiletries, a teeny bathtub, and
the best view of a gravel roof and building mechanics I, for one,
have ever seen.</p>
<p>And also engineers. Undergrad engineers. The Novotel happened
to be hosting the Organization of Professional Engineers Student
Conference (or something) that very weekend. And most of them
seemed to be on the third floor. We settled into our room just
as the engineers were massing to go to dinner. Noisily. I called the front
desk to ask whether there was perhaps a room on a different floor, a floor
with fewer engineers. </p>
<p>They moved us up to the top floor, and in so doing, upgraded us
to a deluxe room which satisfied
many more of my hotel room desires: flat screen TV, schmancy bathroom,
superfluous toiletries. The bathtub was still lame; I've
realized that if you want a hotel with an awesome bathtub you need to go
to a hotel which advertises their awesome bathtubs. And the view...
well, it turns out the Novotel in Toronto doesn't have any good views.
After settling in again, we went out for dinner and beer at C'Est What.</p>
<p>The next morning we availed ourselves of the breakfast buffet, another
of my hotel must-haves. This one was exquisite: fresh, flaky pastries, 
assorted cereal, 
French toast, bacon, sausages (such good sausages!), ham, cheese, 
at least five kinds of bread, yogurt, fruit, coffee, tea, hot chocolate,
chocolate milk, fruits. I was in breakfast heaven.</p>
<p>After eating about three breakfasts worth of breakfast, we waddled
over to the St Lawrence Market to shop, window shop and sample things.
I got some earrings, some strange grains, and gifts: genmaicha for
Tanya and Douglas, and mince tarts for Andy.</p>
<p>Our next mission was to find a Shopper's Drug Mart, which you 
usually can't walk a block without stumbling over but were 
uncharacteristically thin on the ground over by the market there.
So we carried on to the south end of Sherbourne and Toronto's newest
waterfront delight, 
<a href="http://www.waterfrontoronto.ca/explore_projects2/east_bayfront/canadas_sugar_beach">Sugar Beach</a>. It was a gloomy day and we had
the waterfront to ourselves as we walked back towards Yonge Street.
We eventually wandered back to the hotel for an afternoon of
lying around reading newspapers and books. Later we walked up to
Dundas and over to Spadina for delicious Chinese food at E-Pan. (As
it turns out the girls were having dinner just a block south of us.)
We walked back to the St Lawrence Market area for uninspiring 
ice cream at Lettieri, then back to the hotel.</p>
<p>Sunday morning I woke up early and went down to the restaurant for
a cappuccino while Blake slept in. Once he came downstairs we crossed
the street to sit in the sun and wait for Scotland Yard to open for
breakfast. An hour later we breakfasted in the company
of some very vociferous football (soccer) fans. Then back to the hotel
to check out, and we took the TTC home.</p>
<p>It was a lovely weekend but kind of ephemeral. I wish we had done
something spectacular like go to a concert, but after paying for the
hotel we didn't have the budget for any grand gestures. Still, it was
lovely to spend time together without any pressing demands on our time.</p>

I sure turned it from a giant RTF into three beautifully formatted,

<p>Here in North America we have a lot of stuff. Mainly we have a lot
of energy (not the "let's play go to the park and play Ultimate!" kind,
but the "turn up the heat, Martha, I don't want to put on a shirt" kind), and 
we have a lot of food. And when people have access to a lot of something
which is required for survival, like food, or which makes life easier, 
like energy, we consume as much of it as possible. It's our nature.
We evolved in an environment where calories were scarce and precious and
anyone who didn't leap on food (more calories in), or seize the opportunity to 
do less work (fewer calories out) was a fool. A dead, extinct fool.</p>
<p>There's an article in the 11 November 2010 
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/">New Scientist</a> which says
that 40% of the US population will be obese by 2050. Oh, that's
terrible, those disgusting Americans. But Americans are just
like everyone else, except they are constantly surrounded by <em>huge</em>
quantities of cheap, high-calorie food. And so they eat it and 
they get fat, just as we all evolved to do.</p>
<p>At the same time energy is cheap and abundant; there are labour-saving
devices for almost every task imaginable, from changing the channel on 
your TV to raising your blinds to feeding the cat, to say nothing of that
ultimate calorie-intake-optimizing innovation: processed food. And
we avail ourselves of every one — there are precious few people
who will say no to a labour-saving device on principle, and most of them
are so cheaply run we add them to our lives without qualms. No-one
ever rejected an automatic can opener on the grounds that it would cost
too much to run.</p>
<p>The only way to control this process is legislation —
by making overconsumption so much more expensive than austerity that
austerity begins to look good. We need enforced privation.</p>
<p>Show me a politician who will run on that platform and I will show you
a politician with a very short career indeed.</p>
<p>So to conclude, we're screwed. The only way off this rollercoaster of
plenty is to run out. Run out of oil, run out of soil.
And then lots of people will die (hopefully none of my descendants) and 
maybe enough of us will survive (and the planet will be habitable, 
because of course there's enough fossil fuel left to ruin the place completely
if we burn it fast enough) to start the whole merry-go-round again.</p>
<p>Happy Friday!</p>

<p>Here's a recipe I typed in for a friend yesterday. It's not really a
recipe, just something I throw together. Those are always the hardest
to write down.</p>
<h5>Ingredients</h5>
<p>1 butternut squash (or any other squash, probably, except spaghetti)<br>
some butter<br>
some oil, probably not olive<br>
1 onion (or more) - chopped<br>
cumin, cinnamon, nutmeg maybe?<br>
black pepper<br>
chicken broth<br>
cream<br>
sour cream<br>
crusty bread and more butter<br></p>
<h5>Instructions</h5>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Peel the squash. Yes, really, just with a regular vegetable 
peeler. Then cut it in half and scoop out the seeds. Cut it 
into 1 inch blocks (about) and set aside. Chop the onions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warm the butter and oil over medium heat and add the 
onions and some salt. Saute until the onions are soft and 
translucent. You could brown them a little bit if you like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stir some cumin and black pepper and maybe cinnamon <em>or</em> 
nutmeg (not both) into the onion and cook it a little bit until 
the kitchen smells really good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the cut-up squash and enough chicken broth to cover 
everything plus maybe an inch. Bring it to a boil and simmer 
for twenty minutes or so until the squash is soft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take it off the heat and blend everything with your hand 
blender. If it's too thick add some more broth. Add a splash 
of cream — maybe half a cup — and stir it in. Put it back on 
the heat for a while to warm it up again if you like, but 
don't let it boil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serve with a dollop of sour cream and lots of crusty bread 
with butter. And maybe a nice light ale.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy! </p>
