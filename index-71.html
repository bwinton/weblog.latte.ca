<p>Our train was scheduled to leave at 8:30, so we arrived at Union Station at
7:30, possibly a little too early but I'd always rather have time to kill than
hurry, especially with kids. We picked up our tickets, then treated the kids to
Cinnabon cinnamon sticks, which were to be the first of many delicious,
unwholesome treats over the week ahead.</p>
<p>On board the train we settled in, luxuriating in the space and comfort. We
played with the trays and the buttons on the seats, working out all the
different lounging possibilities. </p>
<p>The train started moving on time, and not twenty minutes later Cordelia wanted
to know if we were nearly there. I explained that we would be there after lunch
and dinner, so she only asked two or three times more.</p>
<p>We each spent our train-bound day differently: Delphine braided gimp and read a
lot; I read a little, stared out of the window a lot, escorted missions to the
bathroom and the snack car, and worked a bit; Cordelia looked out the window,
did activity books and drew; Blake read. I created a Train Bingo for Delphine
(a five-by-five grid of things to see out the window: a red roof, a horse, a
water tower, a playground, etc) and then she did one for me. As on an airplane,
meals were an effective diversion: we had sandwiches and carrot sticks for lunch
from the Canadian snack bar, and for dinner, a meatball sub, a hot dog and a
small pepperoni pizza from the American snack bar. (The snack bar changes 
nationality — menu, currency and staff — at the border, at the
same time as the dour border guards come through checking passports and
making sure no-one is smuggling in contraband fruit.)</p>
<p>I was alert and fully conscious in the morning, and it's a good thing I decided
to get some work done then because after lunch I became listless and sluggish.
It's a paradox that sitting around conserving energy is more enervating than
being active, and by around 2:00 in the afternoon all I was good for was
staring out the window looking for the dog, bicycle and yellow-leafed tree that
Delphine's bingo had set me in search of.</p>
<p>New York State is not at its most beautiful in early spring; for hours, it
seemed, the view was of grey swamps and grey trees, with only an occasional
raven or hawk betraying life. In between the swamps there were brief views of
farms and farmhouses on the higher ground.</p>
<p>Eventually the swamps gave way to a wide river (the Hudson, it turns out),
flowing fast with great slabs of ice thrown up on either side of it. The
opposite bank of the river was a towering chunk of rock scattered with leafless
trees. The view was monochromatic and beautiful in its severity, like an Andrew
Wyeth painting.</p>
<p>After dinner the children really started to get fidgety and fretful. Their
normal routine has them going to bed almost immediately after dinner, but
they weren't able to get to sleep at their usual time. On top of that, 
the day of junk food combined with very little activity left them
both with upset stomachs. Cordelia finally fell asleep about forty minutes
before the trip ended, but Delphine wasn't able to sleep at all and was
tired and emotional when we rolled into Penn Station.</p>
<p>The decision to take a cab to the hotel was an easy one, even for Delphine
who hates cars. Cordelia's crying about her tummyache all the way to Queens
didn't impress the cabbie much, although he did not betray any emotion.
Then I unknowingly undertipped him — tipping makes me panic a little 
bit at the best of times, and late at night after a day on a train is not
the best of times. Sorry, Abdullah, wherever you are.</p>
<p>We arrived at the hotel around 10:15 pm and after settling in and brushing
teeth we all went to bed feeling much better, glad to have finally arrived
and excited about the next day.</p>

<p><strong><em>Moral Disorder</em></strong> <strong>by Margaret Atwood</strong> is a series of stories about a
woman named Nell. The stories start in her childhood, move on to a weird (but
just normal-weird, not freaky-weird) relationship with an older guy, and then
ends with a pair of stories about her childhood and her relationship with her
mother. Good, entertaining, interesting.</p>
<p>There's a kind of crankiness, a negativity, to Margaret Atwood's writing which
stops me from reading two of her books in a row. Everything's described in the
most sordid way. I mean, I could describe every annoying and stupid and gross
thing about <em>my</em> life, and leave out all the good bits, and it would sound
overwrought and terrible like Atwood's characters' lives, but really my life is
not all miserable and icky, and I don't buy that Atwood's characters' lives are
all miserable and icky. Sometimes it annoys me that her books are so
relentlessly negative.  Lighten up, lady! Give it a rest! (Lest you mistake
this for intelligent literary commentary, I feel the same way about Stephen
King books.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, the thing I love about Margaret Atwood, and this isn't
something that seems to come up much, is her little jokes. (She likes that too:
a friend of mine saw her do a reading, and apparently she laughs at her own
jokes.) </p>
<p>(Careful readers will note that this is the first of my Alphabetical 
To-Be-Read List Plan, and that I have read several off-list books. If I'm going
to get through any amount of my TBR pile I'm going to have to increase the
on-list:off-list ratio.)</p>

<p><strong><em>Baking Cakes in Kigali</em></strong> by Gaile Parkin is our second book club book.
(The girl who's planning this month's meeting decided we needed something a
little lighter after <em>The Things They Carried</em>. On the one hand, Rwanda; on the
other hand, cakes!) <em>Baking Cakes in Kigali</em> is about a community of ex-pats of
various countries who have come to Kigali to participate in (or take advantage
of) the post-war rebuilding and spending. Centreing the book on non-Rwandans is
a great way to write a book about Rwanda without asking us to get into the
heart of someone who lived through the genocide. Not that that's not a
worthwhile thing to do, but it's not this book.</p>
<p>Our main character is Angel, a Tanzanian grandmother who has recently launched
a custom cake business.  Her husband works for the university, and is the
reason they are in Kigali. They live in an apartment complex populated by
people from other parts of Africa and the world, and one of the delights of the
novel is reading Angel's thoughts on cultural differences within Africa. The
main charm of the book is Angel, actually: her thoughts on her neighbours, on
feminism, on running a small business, and on coping with hardship are
reminiscent of the levelheaded philosophies of Alexander McCall Smith's
Precious Ramotswe.</p>
<p>(Leading, obviously, to the question of whether these white writers are
creating a new sterotype, the "practical African woman". Both Precious
and Angel are admirable characters who you would want to have by your
side in a crisis, but I feel like I need to hear another voice from Africa,
perhaps one that isn't so tailored to my taste as a North American
reader.)</p>
<p><em>Baking Cakes in Kigali</em> isn't a work of great literature, but it was a
pleasant and easy read and raises enough discussion points that I think
it will make for a good book club meeting.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><em>Odd and the Frost Giants</em></strong> <strong>by Neil Gaiman</strong> was perhaps an 
unnecessary diversion from my TBR list, but Delphine had it out from the 
library and I hadn't read it, so I did. Besides, it was short. It's the
story of Odd, who is odd and not entirely wanted at home, so he goes
away. While he's away, he meets some more odd characters: a bear, a fox
and an eagle who aren't behaving as you might expect a bear, a fox and
an eagle to behave. Events transpire, Odd quests and succeeds, learns 
about himself and his family, saves the day and returns home stronger.</p>
<p>It's a wonderful little book, as you'd expect from Gaiman. He has a
gloriously gentle, deadpan way of ushering you into his imagined world
that I loved in the Sandman comics.</p>

<p>A few days ago I had this exchange on Twitter:</p>
<p><strong>@amyrhoda:</strong> Yay, I finished a book off my TBR shelf! And added four more in
the meantime... *headdesk*</p>
<p><strong>@ryan_price:</strong> ha! I just added 3 books yesterday... But i didnt finish
another :(</p>
<p>What I didn't tell Ryan was that three of the four books I added were
children's novels or YA novels. Since then I read two of them, and then
realized that the last one wasn't in keeping with my <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/books/_2011/TBR.html">Alphabetical Reading
List Plan</a> , so I set it aside. (I'm adding new books to the end of the TBR
pile; I can't read them until I've won the alphabet.)</p>
<p>These are the books I read:</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/books/haven.jpg" align="left" alt="Book Cover"></p>
<p><strong><em>Fairy Haven and the Quest for the Wand</em></strong> <strong>by Gail Carson Levine</strong>. Once
upon a time I told myself I would read all the books my kids read. I don't know
what crack I was smoking, because a) I don't even have time to read the books
<em>I</em> want to read, b) Delphine reads about a million books a day, and c)
she reads some serious crap. Good stuff too, but lots of crap.</p>
<p>This one intrigued me, though. On the one hand, Disney. (That's bad.)
On the other, Gail Carson Levine. (That's good.) On the one hand, fairies.
(That's bad.) On the other... Gail Carson Levine? Well, and I also 
love the illustrations, by David Christiana. And Delphine really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>So I gave it a read, and hey, it turns out to be pretty good. The fairy
characters are interesting and well-rounded, in non-obvious ways. (Turns out
Tinkerbell fixes things - she's a tinkerer, get it?) The conflict was exciting,
the climax was thrilling, the writing was lovely. Gail Carson Levine trumps
Disney!</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/books/arrival.jpg" align="right" alt="Book Cover"></p>
<p><strong><em>Hoping For Home: Stories of Arrival</em></strong> is from the <em>Dear Canada</em> series of
historical novels written as diaries. This one is a collection of short
stories about immigration.  (Well, and one about an aboriginal girl, which I
guess was put in for political correctness but since it's not actually about
crossing the Bering Strait/Pacific Ocean thousands of years ago I think
it's a bit of a stretch to include it in a collection about immigration; and
another story which I'm not sure what it was about.) The authors include
Rukhsana Khan, Paul Yee, and Jean Little. For some reason I love immigration
stories, maybe because I immigrated/emigrated so often as a kid, maybe because
I find the fact that people choose Canada as their home perversely 
flattering, definitely because I am in awe of the courage of people who
come here with so little resources and so much hope. </p>
<p>Whatever it is, this book satisfied me with lots of good stories, although I'm
not a great fan of the diary conceit. I often felt that the writing was too
good to be a diary, especially a child's diary, and that pulled me out of the
story.  The author who really captured a child's voice was Brian Doyle. I also
particularly enjoyed Paul Yee's story of a boy joining his father in small-town
Saskatchewan; he brings the reader on the same voyage of discovery that
the protagonist is taking.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this book was a cheat on my Alphabetical Reading List Plan; it is
a book we own, so I should have put it at the end of the list. (The Levine was
a library book so I had to read it before we returned it.) I just forgot...</p>

<p>I'm currently working with <a href="http://third-bit.com">Greg Wilson</a> on
<em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em>. It's a collection of essays
written by open source coders about the architecture of their projects.  I'm
mainly the format monkey, but sometimes Greg lets me out of my cage to do some
editing.  Last week he set me loose on a chapter which had some problems with
structure to see if I could come up with some helpful comments for the author.</p>
<p>I knew the chapter bothered me, and to begin with I could specifically point to
one problem: the author didn't introduce the subject of the chapter until the
fifth paragraph of the second section. (He'd been talking about and around the
subject until then, but never overtly linked it to what he was saying.) Apart
from that I didn't have anything specific and helpful to say. </p>
<p>Also I didn't know what to do next.</p>
<p>Don't tell anyone this, but I'm not really an editor. Okay, I'm an "editor" in
the same sense that I'm a writer: I edit. But I'm not, say, seasoned.
Experienced. I'm new to this. So I didn't know how to approach this chapter.  I
tried a few things.</p>
<p>First I read it again.  (Of course further complicating matters was the fact
that the topic of the chapter is not something I was familiar with, so not only
was I editing the chapter, I was simultaneously learning from it. <sup id="fnref:lesson1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="amy/work/amediting/#fn:lesson1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>)
Reading it again helped me understand the subject better but I still didn't
know what I needed to say to help the author make the chapter better. </p>
<p>Next I wrote out an outline of the chapter, to try and see the overall
structure. That helped me see that the author never clearly stated the problem
he and his team were solving.  But I felt like the outline was too static
— I wanted to be able to move things around.</p>
<p>So I printed out the chapter and cut it up into sections, taped together
along page breaks. That was mildly diverting and passed a lot of time, but
in the end all I really got was a lot of awkwardly-sized bits of paper.
I couldn't do much with the bits of paper, but the act of fabricating them
helped me break the chapter up into blocks, mentally. <sup id="fnref:lesson2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="amy/work/amediting/#fn:lesson2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<p>After all that I finally had a few suggestions, although ironically not
so much on the structure of the chapter — that's mostly fine. The
problem is that the author spends a lot of time providing unnecessary details
and elaborations, while leaving out the "obvious" (to him) fundamentals that
people who don't work with his subject will need to know to understand
the chapter. <sup id="fnref:lesson3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="amy/work/amediting/#fn:lesson3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<p>What I ended up doing was rewriting the first section to clean it up and make
it into an actual introduction, and asking the author to introduce some other
topics more effectively (and gently) later on in the chapter. I hope I will
get a chance to tighten up some of the language and take out excess material
later in the editing process.</p>
<p>The whole process was fun but also made me very uncomfortable. As I
was doing all that outlining, cutting, pasting, researching and thinking 
I felt insecure and kind of dumb. "Is this what I'm supposed to be doing? 
Is this going to work? Am I wasting time? Should I do something different?"
I hate doing things I don't already know how to do, and I had to keep
reminding myself that this is how you learn — you flail, you try
things, you screw up, you try other things, you get better. It does take
time and it does make you feel stupid, but then after it's over you know
a little bit more.</p>
<p>(Note to Greg: I didn't bill you for most of this arduous process. The only
thing worse (for me) than not knowing what I'm doing is not knowing what I'm
doing on someone else's dollar.)</p>

<p>Last year I made some kind of resolution about reading half the books on my To
Be Read shelf. Our bookshelf (it's a 5 by 5 <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/80156281">Expedit</a>, which
they apparently don't make anymore) has little squares, and right now my TBR
pile is taking up two cubbies. I wanted to reduce it to one, but somehow the
size of my TBR pile remains constant.</p>
<p>Like everyone, I imagine, I tend to avoid particular books. Various reasons:
maybe a book seems hard, maybe it's one I feel I "should" read but don't
actually want to, maybe I'm just never in the mood. Anyway, I find that some
books lurk in the TBR shelf for months and years while some just disappear
within weeks.  This year I decided to steel myself and tackle the shelf
alphabetically.</p>
<p><br clear="both"></p>
<p>So here it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atwood, Margaret: <em>Moral Disorder</em> (my mother sent me this)</li>
<li>Conrad, Joseph: <em>Lord Jim</em> (this is a "should" read)</li>
<li>Didion, Joan: <em>The Year of Magical Thinking</em>
</li>
<li>Faber, Adele and Elaine Mazlich: <em>Siblings Without Rivalry</em> (a 
  necessary re-read)</li>
<li>Frey, Stephen: <em>The Power Broker</em>
</li>
<li>Gardiner, John Reynolds: <em>Stone Fox</em> (Delphine recommended this)</li>
<li>Goldreich, Gloria: <em>Open Doors</em> (my mother sent this too)</li>
<li>Grenville, Kate: <em>The Idea of Perfection</em>
</li>
<li>Harris, Marvin: <em>Cannibals and Kings</em> (I picked this up at someone's curb;
  it seems thinky and interesting but maybe totally dated.)</li>
<li>Hawking, Stephen: <em>George's Secret Key to the Universe</em> (I borrowed this
  from a friend; I'm interested in it in theory but the cover is so tacky
  it's putting me off.)</li>
<li>Hegi, Ursula: <em>Stones from the River</em>
</li>
<li>Hochschild, Adam: <em>Bury the Chains</em> (I got this as a gift from 
  <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/">Greg Wilson</a>. It's about
  the dismantlement (that is <em>so</em> a word) of slavery.)</li>
<li>Khan, Rukhsana: <em>Wanting Mor</em>
</li>
<li>McCarthy, Cormac: <em>All The Pretty Horses</em> (Because I read <em>The Road</em>
  and I'm a huge masochist.)</li>
<li>McLaren, Leah: <em>The Continuity Girl</em> (see above re: masochist)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/amy/books/tbr2.jpg" alt="To Be Read Shelf - 2" align="right"></p>
<ul>
<li>McLaughlin, Emma and Nicola Krause: <em>The Nanny Diaries</em> (A friend
  swears this is better than it looks.) </li>
<li>McDonough, William and Michael Braungart: <em>Cradle to Cradle</em> (This is
  a book about sustainable design which I'm halfway through and can't finish.
  It's just so dry. I'm going to give it one more effort.)</li>
<li>Monbiot, George: <em>Heat</em>
</li>
<li>Munro, Alice: <em>The View from Castle Rock</em> (My mother sent me this, too.
  She <em>loves</em> Alice Munro and thinks we should read this in book
  club.)</li>
<li>Nemirovsky, Irene: <em>Suite Francaise</em>
</li>
<li>Ondaatje, Michael: <em>The English Patient</em> (My friend who liked <em>The Nanny
  Diaries</em> hates this book but I have another friend who loves it, so I just
  don't know what to think. I guess I'll have to read it and judge for myself.)</li>
<li>Petroski, Henry: <em>The Evolution of Useful Things</em> (This is another one I've
  started but got bogged down with. I want to like it, though; the subject
  matter is interesting.)</li>
<li>Ritter, Erika: <em>The Dog By the Cradle, the Serpent Beneath</em> (This is a book
  that I was interested in, so I grabbed it at a book sale or off the curb
  or something.)</li>
<li>Sebold, Alice: <em>The Lovely Bones</em>
</li>
<li>Stross, Charles: <em>Iron Sunrise</em> (A while ago I said I wanted to start
  reading sf again, but I made a horrible misstep (in my earnest search for 
  CanCon) and read a Robert Sawyer book. I still haven't recovered, but I
  hope this book will bring me back into the fold.)</li>
<li>Weatherford, Jack: <em>Indian Givers: How the Indians of the Americas 
  Transformed the World</em> (This is the Indian version of that book about how
  the Scots are responsible for everything cool ever. Maybe I will read them
  both and declare a winner.)</li>
<li>Zinnser, William: <em>On Writing Well</em>
</li>
<li>Blume, Judy: <em>Summer Sisters</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(The last thing on that shelf is the choral score to Mendelssohn's <em>Elijah</em>,
which we are performing this spring. I just put it there to have it handy
when we start rehearsing at the end of this month.)</p>
<p>There are a couple of rules. You'll see that the Judy Blume book is out
of order: that's my wild card. If I just can't face the next book on
the list, I get to read <em>Summer Sisters</em>. It's my only wild card, so
I have to use it wisely.</p>
<p>Also I can interrupt the sequence at any time for library books, book club
books, or books which need to be read right away for another reason, like
how-to books.</p>
<p>Let's see how far through the alphabet I get this year.</p>

<p>I picked up <strong><em>I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings</em></strong> <strong>by Maya Angelou</strong> for
free, or very cheap, somewhere because I knew I should read something of
hers. I didn't know anything about her apart from that she's an American poet
and highly respected. I didn't know anything about the book, either, apart from
recognizing the title — I didn't know if it was poetry or a novel, if it
was going to be hard to read or light (didn't really expect it to be light).</p>
<p>Turns out <em>I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings</em> is a memoir of Angelou's
peripatetic and eventful childhood in Arkansas, California and St Louis, and
while it wasn't light, it was an easy read. For the most part the language is
straightforward (but beautiful) and the story is told forthrightly, without
undue metaphor or digression.  Occasionally Angelou steps out of her narrative
to provide a larger context for a situation, or to reflect on an event with the
wisdom of hindsight, but these asides are insightful and welcome.</p>
<p>I didn't expect to enjoy the book as much as I did, and I now find I want
to know what happens next (the book ends when Angelou is sixteen).
Where does she get her last name? What happens to her brother? I
suppose I could find out from Wikipedia, but I'd rather have the story
unfold in the author's words. Lucky for me her memoirs continue in <em>Gather
Together In My Name</em>.</p>

<p>I read <strong><em>Why We Get Fat: And What To Do About It</em></strong> <strong>by Gary Taubes</strong>
after reading this 
<a href="http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/11-01-05/#feature">very 
enthusiastic review</a> in Skeptic Magazine's e-issue. As you can
see, sceptical dude there thinks this book is pretty great.</p>
<p>In the book, <a href="http://www.garytaubes.com/">Taubes</a> talks about what's
currently circulating as common knowledge about fatness: that it all hinges on
the disparity between the number of calories we take in and the number we burn,
and that eating fat makes you fat. He dismantles those theories pretty
completely with counterexamples, logic and science, and at the same
time explains why fat people eat more and exercise less. (Hint: our
fat makes us do it!)</p>
<p>Then he lays out some more science, this time about how fat works,
or more specifically how insulin works. Turns out insulin is evil:
it inhibits the use of fat as an energy source, it forces fat cells to
take lipids from the blood and store them as fat, it causes the
body to create new fat cells. And what makes your body release insulin?
Carbs! Ergo carbs are also evil.</p>
<p>This is where he gets into the Atkins/paleo-diet stuff which I have
always associated with fat-obsessed loonies who will do anything to
be thin, so my hackles are up. And then he says you don't need carbs
<em>at all</em>. And fruit is bad for you! And then in the last chapter 
he lays out a diet which is basically plateful after plateful of meat.
Mmmm. (Ick.)</p>
<p>So. This was an interesting book, and certainly compellingly argued.
Not that it has any scientific value, but my personal experience 
certainly dovetails with Taubes's arguments. (The only time I lost 
any significant amount of weight and kept it off was when I cut carbs
(although I didn't think of it that way): I stopped drinking juice and
buying a dozen bagels every week.) There are counter-arguments to 
Taubes's conclusions on the Internet which I have yet to read, but
for the most part the book rang very true and has definitely changed
the way I think about fatness and nutrition. Although I won't be switching
to that all-meat diet any time soon.</p>

<p>The second book I read this year was the book for our first book club meeting.
<strong><em>The Things They Carried</em></strong> <strong>by Tim O'Brien</strong> is a collection of stories
about the Vietnam war, and coming home from the Vietnam war. (And trying to
avoid <em>going</em> to the Vietnam war.) It's also about storytelling, cameraderie, 
belonging, and the slippery morality of war.</p>
<p>The book club had an interesting variety of reactions to this book. 
One of us said she couldn't relate to any of the characters in the book
on account of them being men, but that she really enjoyed the writing.
I thought the writing was compelling but I didn't really <em>notice</em> it.
Which would normally be a good thing, but I feel like I should notice
writing, pay attention to it, so I can improve my own writing. I guess
that's what the second reading is for, but I'm too impatient to read anything
twice. Something to work on.</p>
<p>Another book club member thought she didn't like it, but in retrospect realized
that she liked that one part... and the other chapter... and that bit about...
actually it was really sticking with her and that must be good. It's that kind
of book — you may not enjoy reading it but it gives you lots of things to
think about. I liked it — the characters were compelling, and I liked the
ideas and questions it raised, especially the question of the difference
between a true story, and something that really happened.</p>
