<p><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="blake/tech/thunderbird/bugzilla.css"><script type="text/javascript" src="blake/tech/thunderbird/bugzilla.js"></script></p>
<p>On a <a href="http://breakingtheegg.tumblr.com/post/10525122364/cooking-up-some-tabs-on-top-for-thunderbird">previous post</a> in a different blog, some commenters were asking us if we were
considering doing things that we have planned to do for a while now, and
that led me to realize that I haven’t been communicating the future of
Thunderbird’s UI nearly well enough.  I mainly blame it on my trying to do
too many other things, and thus failing to cover all the bases.  So, having
said all that, here is the list of things, in no particular order, that I
would like to see worked on in the next few versions of Thunderbird.  But
first, I’ld like to say a little bit about why I want them.</p>
<p>I recently heard about someone who said “Thunderbird looks like iTunes”,
and while that’s rather complimentary given the amount of time Apple puts
into making things look good, it doesn’t really lead me to believe that
people can pick our product out of a screenshot.  And so one of the overall
goals is to make Thunderbird iconic.  You can always tell when a screenshot
is of Apple mail, based on the layout and the lack of colour, and Firefox
is similarly immediately recognizable because of the big circular back
button and smaller rectangular forward button.  Similarly, I’m hoping to
have Thunderbird look different to other apps, while still fitting in on
the platform, and maintaining a little consistency with Firefox.  Of
course, that’s not the only goal, nor even the main goal.  My main idea for
Thunderbird is to let you focus on the content that’s important to you, and
not be distracted by things you don’t care about.  Hopefully most of the
changes I talk about here will help that, and as a side benefit also help
to give us a more unique style.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A simple thing that will make the product nicer to use is just to line
  things up.  We’re all over the place, and it should be fairly simple to
  make this better.  There are a couple of bugs that are related to this,
  and I suspect we could file a few more for various other parts.
  </p>
<div id="bug-667235"></div>
  <div id="bug-689543"></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>We want to put the tabs on top, because they let us put the compose and
  address book into tabs, while still having the appropriate toolbars.  (As
  well, having everything be a tab makes the application more consistent,
  as described in the next point.)
  </p>
<div id="bug-644169"></div>
  <div id="bug-449299"></div>
  <div id="bug-457270"></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>This leads into removing the standalone Compose and Address Book windows.
  You’ll still be able to open a window for those functions, but it will
  just be a regular window with a Compose or Address Book tab.  (No bugs
  for this yet.  Removals are sensitive things, and we want to get the
  replacement UI working well before we remove the existing UI.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We really want the Thunderbird button, so that we can hide the menus, and
  have less Glass on Windows, and make the most common actions easier to
  find and use.
  </p>
<div id="bug-650170"></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>But, to add that button, we first need to see what the most common menu
  items people use are, therefore we need Test Pilot.
  </p>
<div id="bug-679513"></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>We would like to add a HomeTab, to give people a personalized place to
  land when they start Thunderbird, or open a new window.
  </p>
<div id="bug-605652"></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>We would like to merge the Gloda bar and Quick Filter bar, cause duh.
  </p>
<div id="bug-667246"></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having two different settings locations is too confusing for me, let
  alone people who don’t care about the details of the product. We want to
  merge those into a single searchable place for all the settings, a la Mac
  System Prefs.
  </p>
<div id="bug-509397"></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>This next change is more a small, personal thing, rather than part of a
  grand plan.  It was originally suggested by <a href="http://beltzner.ca/mike/">Mike Beltzner</a>, and while I’ve had some time to work on it, I
  haven’t had enough to push it through to completion.  Basically, I’ld
  like to be able to order my email by date, while grouping it by subject.
  (This is different than threading, because I don’t care about which
  replies are to which messages.  I just want a single group for the
  subject, with the messages ordered by date within that group, and the
  groups ordered by the date of the most recent message.)  There’s no bug
  for this yet, but as mentioned, I started to write <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/users/bwinton_latte.ca/bmode/file/65d446ca2d54">an extension</a>,
  before hitting some annoying bugs that made it hard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compactify the header.  It’s really too big.  Well, that’s a bit of a
  lie.  What I really mean here is that we should move the buttons and
  their toolbar out of the header, to float just above it.  This would
  allow people to easily turn them off (by removing the entire toolbar),
  and for those of us who like to keep them, it would make them more
  visually distinct.  As an added bonus, in vertical mode, we could merge
  that toolbar with the other toolbars, to get something like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/asadotzler/6137086055/">the
  pictures</a> of what
  Thunderbird could look like posted by <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/">Asa Dotzler</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And finally, I think we should remove the Migration Assistant.  It was
  very useful in the 2.0⇒3.0 transition, but it’s been less and less useful
  as time goes on, and as people have moved more and more onto Thunderbird
  3, and 4, and 5…  (No bug for this one either, again, because removals
  are sensitive things.)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><small>Many thank-yous to <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/">Alex Faaborg</a>, and <a href="http://www.areweprettyyet.com/">areweprettyyet</a> for the code to link the bugs, and the

<p>Add-ons are an important part of many Mozilla products, and many people
have noticed that they’ve taken a hit as we’ve switched to the Rapid
Release process.  To help users have a little more control over how well
their Firefox works, I would like to propose the following slight
modification to the automatic Update process:</p>
<p>It all starts when Firefox (and Thunderbird) notice an update is available.</p>
<p>We immediately check the user’s add-ons to see if they are compatible, or
if there are compatible versions we haven’t downloaded yet.</p>
<p>If all the add-ons are compatible (or will be made so at the next
download), we show the NoAddons dialog:</p>
<p><img alt="NoAddons dialog" src="images/blake/updates/NoAddons.png"></p>
<p>It‘s the same as the current Firefox or Thunderbird update dialog, and as
you would expect, the “Ask Later” and “Update Firefox” buttons do the same
things that they do now.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if there <em>are</em> in-compatible add-ons, we show the Addons
dialog:</p>
<p><img alt="Addons dialog" src="images/blake/updates/Addons.png"></p>
<p>As you can see, we let the user know which add-ons are incompatible, and
give the user an extra button at the bottom to do something different.</p>
<p>The new “Update when my add-ons work” button (wording to be clarified
later) will check the add-ons periodically, and automatically update
Firefox when all the add-ons are compatible.  If the add-ons aren’t
compatible after a week (period of time to be configurable), the user will
be shown this dialog again, with the (hopefully smaller) list of
incompatible add-ons.</p>
<p>Showing the user which add-ons are incompatible will let them decide
whether the add-ons are important enough to not upgrade, or whether they
can live with the (hopefully short) period of reduced functionality.</p>
<p>As always, comments welcome, but keep them polite or they’ll be deleted.</p>

<p>I haven't posted about the girls for ages because Delphine's not totally
comfortable with being the subject of a blog any more. I guess if you want to
get to know Delphine better you'll have to either meet her or wait until she
starts her own blog. But I might sneak in the odd post, like this one.</p>
<p>This week Delphine started Grade Three and Cordelia started Grade One.
Cordelia wasn't excited about starting Grade One until a few days before, when
her sister convinced her it would be fun. Delphine has had Cordelia firmly
under her wing since school started: they entered the first day fray together
(with strict instructions to us to stay out of the way) and they have been
meeting up at recess and sharing snacks. </p>
<p>Both girls love their respective teachers. Delphine is in a 2/3 split which
seems like it's going to be an awesome class. Cordelia is in a 1/2 split – I'm
not sure who is in that class but I really like the teacher so I think it will
be a good year for her, too.</p>
<p>More generally, Cordelia is still clinging to her baby status. She doesn't like
to read, although I think she reads better than she likes to let on.  She also
flat-out refused to learn to ride a bike this summer, although she's learning
to go like stink on the scooter to keep up with Big Sister. I'm curious to see
what being in Grade One will do for her carefully maintained aura of
incompetence. I'm pretty sure she steps up and shows her abilities when she's
at school, and I think soon she's going to have to accept that we know that she
can do stuff.</p>
<p>Cordelia has always had an affinity for numbers (as I expect I've mentioned)
and her report card last year said "Cordelia shows an avid interest in math".
I'm curious to see how that interest develops in Grade One's more advanced
math.</p>
<p>Cordelia's my little maker. Her catchphrase is "I could use that for
something!", whenever I try to throw away some interesting box or widget. And
indeed, if I let her have the thing she will cut it up and glue some other bits
to it and transform it into a building or a slide or a cat or some other
creation. I so want to take her to a Maker Faire.</p>
<p>Around about when she turned eight Delphine transformed from a little kid into
a pre-adolescent. I used to think "tween" was a nonsense marketing category,
but there's a marked difference between seven and eight. She's got a new
spirit, a little bit of sassiness and attitude, but not in a bad way; she's
still polite and civil (mostly) but she's got opinions.  A few of her rants:
"Why do they change everything when they make movies out of books?!" (with a
subrant: "'How to Train Your Dragon' was nothing like the book!"); "Everyone
thinks Canadians live in igloos!"; "Why does everyone drive everywhere?!"; and
one of my favourites, "Everyone else has a nice basement, why is ours is all
gross?!" She's going through a bit of a noisy, self-righteous phase which, if
she doesn't grow out of it, will serve her well on the Internet (or in the
Computer Science Club) some day. But it all comes from noticing the greater
world and realizing that there are different ways to be in it, and trying to
work out what your choices say about you.</p>
<p>This year she's starting ballet, which will hopefully teach her 
self-discipline and maybe some humility (unless she turns out to be really
good at it). She's still enjoying piano, and she's taking an art class
with Cordelia. Perhaps a little overscheduled; we'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>The sad thing is, I wasn't all that hungry when I was in Japan.  Normally I
love to eat but I couldn't get excited about food, probably because of the heat
and humidity. It's terribly ironic, to me, to go all that way to somewhere
where I'd normally want to stuff my face and then not being interested.
Fortunately I was hanging out with a person with a normal appetite, so we ate
regularly and interestingly anyway. (If I had been by myself I might have just
survived on bread and fruit juice, and that would have been a pity.)</p>
<p>My first meal in Japan was dinner: <strong>okonomiyaki</strong> at a cook-it-yourself restaurant
near Ameyayokocho, with Dave and his friend Robert. We had a kind of
miscellaneous omelette, fried enoki mushrooms in butter (<em>so</em> good!) and some
sautéed greens. The greens came in their own little soup of cornstarchy
sauce, which you are supposed to add gradually to the greens. After you have
cooked the greens and sauce, you add a bunch of cheese, which suddenly changes
the whole thing from sautéed greens to fried cheese with bits of greens. Tasty.</p>
<p>We also had a couple of flagons of <strong>Japan's Default Beer</strong>. You go into a
restaurant and order "beer" and they bring you "beer", a glass mug of a
cold, easy-drinking lager with a good inch of head on it.  (Usually Asahi
Super-Dry or Kirin Lager, I think.) It was the perfect drink in that weather,
and Dave and I had one with almost every meal.</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/japan/breakfast.jpg" alt="Japanese Breakfast" align="left">
For the next morning's breakfast I had ordered the "<strong>Japanese breakfast</strong>" at my
<a href="http://www.sakura-ryokan.com/english/ehome.html">ryokan</a>, and I was
eager to find out what it entailed. It turned out to be rice, miso soup, some
lightly-pickled sliced cucumber, steamed greens in a sweet sesame sauce,
scrambled egg with tomato and orange on the side, and some grilled fish. Also
green tea and a little package of nori. It was a lot of food and I didn't
finish everything, which I'm sure is either completely insulting or totally
acceptable. The fish was delicious: mild and slightly crispy on the outside.</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/japan/tinyshrimp.jpg" alt="Tiny shrimp sushi" align="right">
For lunch that day I decided we should have <strong>sushi</strong>, since that's the
quintessential Japanese food in my mind. Dave found us a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conveyor_belt_sushi">conveyor belt sushi</a>
place where we had eel, salmon, tuna, tiny fish, tiny shrimp, and plenty more. </p>
<p>Later that afternoon we wandered to Harajuku, where the street eat of choice is
crepes. This is curious because there aren't really any other street eats in
Japan, apart from the odd soft-serve ice cream place — walking while eating
just isn't done — but for some reason it's acceptable to eat a filled crepe
folded into a cone while walking around Harajuku.  I had <strong>ice cream, chocolate
syrup and whipped cream in my crepe</strong>; I think Dave had bananas or apples in
syrup or something similar. (Dave has lost lots of weight since moving to Japan
by eating carefully and walking a lot; I think he must have had to eat even
more carefully and walk even more after I left to make up for sharing my bad
habits while I was there.)</p>
<p>For dinner that evening we went to a (chain?) restaurant which offered
a variety of food: garlic cheese bread, pizza, shrimp chips, chicken.
We had some gyoza and an <strong>assorted yakitori plate</strong> (grilled chicken parts on sticks; mmm, chicken kidneys). I think we also had something with cheese, but it's
hard for me to say because I was rocking some serious jet lag and pretty
much falling asleep on my plate.</p>
<p>Next day's Japanese breakfast was about the same, but with salmon instead
of the mystery white fish.</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/japan/ramen.jpg" alt="Ramen" align="left">
We had <strong>ramen</strong> for lunch in Fujisawa, on the way to Enoshima. It was
a rustic little restaurant, staffed only by two cooks behind the bar. You order
by selecting and paying for your dish from a machine, then giving the
resulting receipt to the cooks.  It was delicious: the meat was tender,
the noodles were soft with that particular chewiness you only get from
freshly made noodles, and the broth was savoury and rich. (I wish I had
been as hungry when I had it in front of me as I am now writing about it.
Irony!)</p>
<p>It was on Enoshima that we had the <strong>mango softserve ice cream</strong> that I
posted about earlier. It was almost like a mango sorbet, with enough
creaminess to make it luxurious without cutting the refreshing fruitiness
of the mango. Served in a twist ("mix") with vanilla it was like a
creamsicle all grown up.</p>
<p>After Enoshima we went on a long train ride to a yakitori restaurant run by
some friends of Dave's. We could have ridden the whole way in a standard JR
train car, like a fancier subway car, but there's an option on JR (the rail
company) to take a "Green car", a sort of first-class which is more like a
double-decker GO train car — cushy reclining seats with a tray, and drink
and snack service (with <em>very</em> cheap beer!)</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/japan/sink.jpg" alt="Sink" align="right">
The restaurant was like a pub, kind of dark and medieval with low ceilings and
lots of wood. (Never mind the high-tech powered sliding door which are all-but
ubiquitous in stores and restaurants.)  The sink in the picture gives you an
idea of the rough-hewn feel of the place.</p>
<p>Once again the food was delicious: we had grilled bits and pieces on sticks,
<strong>mostly-raw chicken</strong> (I wasn't up for more than a taste of that), and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiyayakko"><strong>hiyayakko</strong></a>,
sliced tofu with soy sauce and fish flakes. (A.k.a., "That cold shit.", as
Dave thinks of it.) Also more beer.</p>
<p>For Sunday's breakfast I requested "Western-style", as much because I wanted
to see what they would do with it as because I craved familiar food. 
<strong>"Western-style" breakfast</strong> turns out to include back bacon, scrambled egg,
a giant slab of toasted white bread, tomato and some orange. Also penne
with sweet tomato sauce, and steamed broccoli. Of course.</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/japan/tonkatsu.jpg" alt="Tonkatsu" align="left">
We had lunch at a chain <strong>tonkatsu</strong> restaurant called Wako. I had a combo with
pork medallions, a shrimp and some pumpkin, all breaded and deep-fried, as well
as a haystack of shredded cabbage and the usual miso soup and bowl of white
rice.  There was a side of mayo, for what I'm not sure (I made the cabbage into
coleslaw with it). Also <strong>chawan mushi</strong>, a savoury custard. The tonkatsu was
crispy and delicious and the pile of cabbage was a refreshing change from the
analogous pile of french fries you would get on this side of the Pacific.  It,
as well as the miso soup (I think) were bottomless — you could hail the
waitress and she would come over with a enormous bowl of shredded cabbage and
pile another stack of it on your plate.</p>
<p>Having had a tasty plate of deep fried for lunch, we set out vaguely in search
of something healthy for dinner. I moved to a hotel in Saitama on Sunday, so we
were in Saitama for dinner, and had a choice of the usual suspects: ramen,
sushi, and so on. We eventually talked each other into <strong>Korean barbeque</strong> and
decided to be healthy another day.</p>
<p>Most Japanese restaurants have pictures of all the dishes they offer, but the
interesting thing about Korean barbeque is that the food in the pictures is
still raw. I guess that's not the most interesting thing — the most
interesting thing is that the food they bring to your table is still raw. Each
table is fitted with its very own little fire pit, some intrepid young man
comes by with a bucket of hot coals and skillfully sets it into place, and then
you use cunning little tongs to cook everything to your taste. We had some
delicious strips of beef and placated the gods of healthy eating by roasting up
some assorted veggies.</p>
<p>There was no breakfast at my hotel in Saitama, so on Monday morning I ventured
out on my own to find something to eat. It seems like an odd choice, but I
found it at 7/11. They have a decent selection of cellophane-wrapped pastries,
so I bought <strong>brioche sort of thing</strong>, and added a can of delicious <strong>Boss
Caffe Latte</strong> from the vending machine in the hotel lobby.</p>
<p>Lunch led us on an epic train journey to Utsonomiya, the world's
gyoza capital, for (that's right) gyoza. We went to a tiny restaurant
and ordered their <em>special plate of 12 gyoza</em>*, all different (and beer!) There
were pork, shrimp, chicken, kim chee, pork and shiso, and some more which
were delicious but not readily identifiable. (I actually left the kim chee
dumpling; it was just too spicy for lightweight me — Dave helped
me out with it.)</p>
<p>(The more I write this post the sadder I am that I had no appetite to speak of
while I was in Tokyo. Everything was good but it would have been even better if
I had been hungry.)</p>
<p>By dinner time I was craving a Pickle Barrel big salad. I don't know what it
says about me that when I'm in a foreign country full of exotic, delicious food
I crave the most pedestrian Western food, but there it is. All I desired was a
giant bowl of crispy iceberg lettuce, ham, eggs, and chicken smothered in some
unctuous dressing. There is about 0% chance of finding that anywhere in Tokyo,
let alone Saitama. We wandered around sussing out various restaurants and
finally chose an odd little second-floor pub, advertising $3 beer in the
window.  (We weren't sure whether $3 beer was a good sign or not, food-wise,
but we figured at least it meant there would be $3 beer.)</p>
<p>The place was decorated in a blackened-wood and fishing nets motif. We got
ourselves a beer, and ordered what might be the closest thing to my big salad
you'd find in Tokyo: a <strong>green salad with sashimi</strong>. It was delicious, and hit
the spot. We also had <strong>shrimp and cheese sticks</strong> — shrimp with cheese
rolled in an egg roll wrapper and fried — and I think Dave ordered some
other stuff I either didn't try or tried and didn't remember.</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/japan/egg.jpg" alt="Individually wrapped boiled egg" align="right">
On Tuesday my 7/11 breakfast was a <strong>boiled egg (individually wrapped)</strong>
and a <strong>Georgia Iced Coffee</strong>. I thought the Georgia Iced Coffee would be pretty
much the same as the Boss Iced Coffee, but it was much more bitter and
metallic-tasting. I learned from Dave, later, that all the different
iced coffee brands have distinctive flavours, and I just lucked into the
one I like best first try.</p>
<p>We were down at Tokyo Bay at lunchtime — I wanted to check out Tokyo's
"Harbourfront". There's a big mall down there (Doug Ford take note!) and
they were having some kind of ramen festival in one of the food courts.  (Or
else one of the food courts was set up to simulate a perpetual ramen festival;
now that I think about it I'm not quite sure which.) I had a hankering for eel,
so I ordered something which looked like a delicious bowl of ramen with eel on
top. Turns out the colour reproduction on the picture was a little off, and I
got a delicious bowl of <strong>ramen with two slices of boiled bacon on top</strong>. (Dave
tells me it was Okinawa-style ramen, which is of course different from the
various other kinds of ramen.) I know boiled bacon sounds disgusting, but it
was smoky and tender. I expect if you tried boiling Canadian mass market bacon
it would fall apart or go slimy, but I think if you got good bacon from a
butcher it would boil up nicely. Try it in soup!</p>
<p>I also had some <strong>melon soda</strong>. Melon is a big flavour over there, although it
seemed more vaguely fruity than tasting of any melon I'm familiar with.</p>
<p>After we walked around the waterfront some more we had <strong>kakigori</strong>, which
is like a sno-cone or granita or whatever they call flavoured ice where
you are. I chose Blue Hawaii flavour, which is... blue. And sweet. It
was delicious, just the thing to eat while sitting by the water and
sweating gently.</p>
<p>Our next stop was Tokyo Tower, where I had a piece of <strong>cheesecake</strong> at
the restaurant up top. Cheesecake seems to be quite popular in Tokyo, and
I was curious as to how it was interpreted. It was softer and smoother
than a New York-style cheesecake, and had a nice sharp cream cheesy bite.</p>
<p>Dinner was fancy, at the Chou Chou Dinning Room (not to be confused
with Tony's Fine Dinning, a roti place up on Sheppard). Like many restaurants
in Tokyo, it was on the second floor — Tokyoites don't have our 
aversion to going up a level or two to eat or shop. The restaurant
was beautiful; we entered on a transparent walkway over a mock riverbed
of white stones. Shiny dark wood and elegant lighting set a mood of
quiet refinement.</p>
<p>Keeping with the classy style of the place, I refrained from ordering my
usual beer and had a <strong>grapefruit sour</strong> instead.  We ordered <strong>chicken
gyoza</strong> and <strong>little fish baked in phyllo</strong>, with the
heads still on. But the highlight of the meal was the <strong>risotto</strong>, a creamy
sweet-savoury delight.</p>
<p>Wednesday was my last day in Tokyo. My final 7/11 breakfast was a <strong>green
bun filled with cantaloupe-flavoured custard</strong>. Why was it green?
Green tea? Melon? Mint? It's hard to say, and the flavour wasn't much
help. The custard was delicious, though, and not something I'm likely
to ever get in Toronto. I also had a tub of yogurt in a vague attempt
to eat some protein, and, sadly, my last can of Boss Caffe Latte.</p>
<p>Dave and I decided that my last meal in Tokyo should be the iconic <strong>conveyor
belt sushi</strong>, so for lunch we ducked into a really cheap little place. 
It was fascinating — they had laid out the restaurant so that the
conveyor belt wound round into every cranny of the odd-shaped room, so it
formed an irregular, jagged L-shape and we had to shuffle sideways behind half
the other diners to get to our chairs. </p>
<p>I didn't realize how cheap the place was until Dave pointed out they were
serving fake wasabi.  But even the cheapest saddest Tokyo sushi is still fresh
and delicious; really, the only thing that distinguished it from more expensive
sushi was that the rolls were slightly misshapen. We had the usual selection of
tuna, salmon, and clam. Dave scooped himself a plate of natto sushi, and I had
some alarmingly tacky shrimp salad sushi, while I amused myself trying to think
what you could serve conveyor-belt style in a Canadian restaurant: sandwiches?
Salads? It's such a great way to have lunch: fast, fresh and cheap.</p>
<p>My very last Japanese food purchase was a can of <strong>peach soda</strong> from a
vending machine in the airport. Even though I was only there for a week, the
idea of Japanese vending machines has lodged itself in my brain, to the
extent that whenever I go to a public park in Toronto I'm always briefly
disappointed that I can't buy myself a can of coffee or a soda from a handy
vending machine.</p>
<p>I love eating in other countries; you learn so much about a place from what and
how they eat. I loved the little plates, which allow you to try lots of
different things, and to eat as much as you like and no more. I liked the way
everyone orders together and shares the food. I think the Japanese custom of
not eating while walking is healthy and sensible (although it would take me
more than a week to get out of the habit). And I liked the food itself:
everything (apart from my 7/11 delights) was freshly made from excellent
ingredients. Tokyo is a great destination if you like to eat.</p>

There are hardly any urban animals in Tokyo. I didn't see any wild mammals at
all (although I'm sure they have rats) and the only birds I saw were
crows and sparrows. There are cats around shrines because the monks
feed them.</p>
<hr>
<p>When you go to a restaurant you get a little towel in a plastic bag.
Sometimes it's a disposable wet wipe, sometimes it's a little facecloth
(hot or cold). The catch is you don't get a napkin.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="images/amy/japan/hydrangeas.jpg" align="left" alt="hydrangeas growing by
the subway">
There are hydrangeas everywhere; in parks and gardens, but also growing wild
by train tracks. I also spotted daylilies and hostas — it was cool to see my
garden friends in their native environment.</p>
<hr>
<p>July in Tokyo is really freaking hot. Really, and humid too. They don't
report a Humidex, which is good because it'd be up in the 40s and it would
make everyone feel worse. </p>
<p><img src="images/amy/japan/cloths.jpg" align="right" alt="facecloths for sale">
The good people of Tokyo don't suck it up and act all stoic, they hate it and
deal with it in a number of ways. Hand fans are very popular and no-one is shy
about using them — lots of companies give out fans as promotional material.
Everyone carries little <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/schmatte">schmattes</a> to mop themselves
with. You can buy them all over the place.</p>
<p>A lot of ladies carry parasols. These are distinguished from umbrellas
by their eyelet lace edging. I assume if you are expecting rain and sun on
the same day you have to carry both devices.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="images/amy/japan/manhole.jpg" align="left" alt="manhole">
All the manhole covers are pretty, and they're different in every area.</p>
<hr>
<p>They have awesome transit in Tokyo. There are a bunch of different companies
which provide subway and train service, but they all work together 
seamlessly because they use the same payment card system. Yet again the TTC
looks like a bunch of bush league amateurs by comparison. (Not that they're
dealing with the same size user base. But still. They could suck less.)</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="images/amy/japan/sidewalkgarden.jpg" align="right" alt="sidewalk garden">
No-one in Tokyo has a garden so some people get their green thumb on by
creating sidewalk gardens; pots and planters on the sidewalk. I saw
a rosebush in one, and a little fish pond with water plants and actual
fish in another.</p>
<hr>
<p>Most restaurants serve meals as a collection of little dishes; instead of
ordering, say, steak which comes with veg and potatoes, you'd order a little
plate of steak, a little plate of veg and a little plate of potatoes.  And you
don't order everything up front, you order a few things, then add some more
stuff later if you're still hungry.  (You also share with everyone, so if you
don't feel like what everyone else feels like, you're screwed. Until dessert,
then everyone gets what they want.)</p>
<p>It's a great way to eat - you can order the right amount of food and
stop when you're full instead of being tempted to finish a big plateful.
And you can order the exactly kind of food you want and the restaurant
doesn't get to screw you by serving you a giant pile of cheap carbs and calling
it a deal.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="images/amy/japan/childseat.jpg" align="right" alt="child seat in bathroom">
Some of the bathroom stalls have little child seats mounted on the wall 
for you to park your baby when you pee. I cannot tell you how much I 
wanted this feature when my kids were babies!</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="images/amy/japan/mangosoftserve.jpg" align="left" alt="mango soft-serve

They have great softserve flavours. I don't know why we stick with 
chocolate and vanilla here, because mango-vanilla swirl is sublime.
I also spotted green tea and black sesame.</p>
<hr>
<p>Parks and playgrounds in Tokyo run the gamut from lame to non-existent.
They have a few big parks, but they're not big on lawns and greenspace.
I spotted a handful of playgrounds, but they all featured the same
monkey bars, two swings and a metal slide. I also didn't spot any children
at the playgrounds. I don't know if Japanese kids
play at private playgrounds, or if they just don't play at all and are at
organized activities.</p>
<hr>
<p>They have 24-hour karaoke. (<em>24-hour karaoke!!!</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="images/amy/japan/shoes.jpg" align="left" alt="shoes"><img src="images/amy/japan/socks.jpg" align="right" alt="socks">
Shoes in Japan are awesome. Okay, plenty of women wear boring shoes, but 
there are some amazing shoes worn just out and about. And the fancy shoe
ladies are dedicated to high heels.</p>
<p>To go with the shoes are lots of fancy sock options; some girls even wear 
socks with strappy sandals. They have sock configurations for every kind of
shoes; tiny socks with lace mary-jane straps and lace trim to wear with ballet
flats, socks with a split at the toe to wear with thong sandals, socks with
cut-out heels for...  when you feel like wearing socks with cut-out heels.
Socks in Japan have gone beyond their traditional role as foot/shoe protectors;
they augment the shoe.</p>

<p>A friend of mine recently
<a href="https://twitter.com/eccentricflower/status/80817396696358913">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EVERY behavior aspect of EVERY application should be user-settable if
the user is prepared to drill down far enough. No exceptions.
Even if the user will be shooting his own foot by messing with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I, obviously, disagree with him, and wanted to explain why in a few more
characters than Twitter would allow.</p>
<p>While giving the user complete control over every aspect of an application
seems like a good idea, there are two slightly-hidden downsides to it.</p>
<p>First, every choice you give the user doubles the amount of testing you
have to do.  (Okay, it doesn’t exactly double it, but it certainly adds a
testing, maintenance, and support burden.)  Is it a responsible use of your
time to implement these options if less than 1% of your users will ever
change them (and risk shooting their own feet), or would it be better for
everyone to implement a feature that more people would use?</p>
<p>Second, Emacs notwithstanding, you’ll never get to a great text editor by
customizing a mail reader.  The whole Unix (and iOS, oddly) philosophy is
to write each app to do one thing, and do it well.  Not to do a whole bunch
of optional things.  And if you’re doing only one thing, presenting an
option to the user to do it or not doesn’t make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>And finally, because I can’t count, if you offer people too much choice, it
imposes a cognitive burden on them which can lead to their making no
choices at all, or at least not making them any happier than when they had
fewer choices.</p>
<p>To bring this back to the product I’m working on, we are going out of our
way to make Thunderbird more usable and part of that is simplifying it by
offering fewer, more meaningful choices.</p>

the state of my wallet, and the state of my desk, and the state of my yard, and
indeed the state of my house. When that much of your life is in disarray it

<p>One of the big questions I had when I started writing patches was who I
should ask to review them.  Now that I’ve been in the community for a
while, I’ve got a much better sense of who I should be talking to for the
type of things I’m likely to write, but there are still times when I want
to make a change in a part of the code that I haven’t touched before, and
I’m not sure who to ask.  In those cases, I usually fall back to a fairly
simple (if non-obvious) set of steps to try and figure out who to pick.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the list of files I’ve changed.</li>
<li>Get the hg log for those files.</li>
<li>Check through the log for “r=”, and “sr=”.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, that’s a fairly easy set of steps to automate, and so I present
my first cut at <a href="https://github.com/bwinton/Mozilla-Tools/blob/master/getReviewer.py">the automated reviewer chooser</a>!</p>
<p>Of course, there are a lot of things I’ld like to do with this, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving the documentation.</li>
<li>Checking to see how well this script would have done on previous commits.</li>
<li>Taking into account the length of the queues for the reviewers.</li>
<li>Adding some sort of recent-ness calculations.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I think that this tool is useful enough in its current state that
releasing it and getting feedback on what to actually work on would be a
win.</p>
<p>To use it, be in a mercurial source repo, and type <code>getReviewer.py</code> to get
a list of suggested reviewers for the current differences, or
<code>getReviewer.py temp.diff</code> or <code>getReviewer.py
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi\?id\=536017</code> to specify a
different set of changes.</p>

treated with the chemical agent and picked nits for hours, but that didn't do
the trick so I treated her again today with some herbal stuff of dubious value
and spent another hour or so picking nits.</p>
<p>My brother is getting married in July, which is going to be completely
awesome, but I've never been to Japan before and I have a ton of things
to do, get, and read about before I go.</p>
