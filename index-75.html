<p>The girls are six and nine now, and they are starting to hear pop music
at camp and at their friends houses.  When we were in Saskatchewan they
asked me to make mix CDs for them, and they both requested a few songs.
I padded their choices with a few tunes of my own, and here's what they
ended up with:</p>
<h5>Delphine's 2012 Summer Mix CD</h5>

<dt>"Call Me Maybe", Carly Rae Jepsen</dt>
<dt>"Black Horse &amp; Cherry Tree", K.T. Tunstall</dt>

<dt>"Drinking Games", Library Voices</dt>
    <dd>CBC Saskatchewan is really great about playing local music
    on their morning show, and we heard this while we were hanging out
    in my mum's room having our morning tea.
    </dd>
<dt>"Pumped Up Kicks" by Foster the People</dt>
    <dd>I asked Twitter what terrible pop songs the kids were listening
    to these days, and the lovely <a href="http://www.twitter.com/LadySnarksalot">@LadySnarksalot</a> sent
    me her playlist. This is one of her tunes.</dd>
<dt>"Nothing On You" by B.o.B. featuring Bruno Mars</dt>
<dt>"Firework" by Katy Perry</dt>
    <dd>Delphine has this song memorized and can sing it while performing
    a dance of her own creation.

<dt>"Brokenhearted" by Karmin</dt>
<dt>"Born This Way" by Lady Gaga</dt>
<dt>"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" by Shakira</dt>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/bwinton/australis-customization/">side-project</a> I’m working
on is coming along nicely, and so I figured it was time to let other people
see it.  Now, I could just have everyone huddle around my screen, but since
many of the people who would be interested aren’t in the same city (or even
same timezone) as I am, that wouldn’t work out so well.  We tried screen-
sharing, but a lot of what’s being worked on is animation, and the frame-rates
of the screen-sharing application we were using weren’t up to the task.  To
get around that, I could have recorded a video, but since a lot of the value
of a prototype like this is being able to play around with it, that’s also not
a great solution.  So, obviously, the best thing to do would be to put it on a
publicly available server, and let people run it in their own web browser,
whenever they wanted!</p>
<p>Now, I’m running a server or two that I could put it up on, but since the
project is related to Mozilla, and since Mozilla offers some personal webspace
on <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/">one of their servers</a>, I figured I might as
well put it up <a href="https://people.mozilla.com/~bwinton/australis/customization/mac/?scroll">there</a>.  :)</p>
<p>So, to make it easy for me to remember to build and upload the code (and to
prevent me from trying to figure out all the correct options to rsync every
time I wanted to upload the code), I took a couple of minutes to <a href="https://github.com/bwinton/australis-customization/blob/master/australis/customization/mac/volofile#L23">add a
command</a> to my volofile, which lets me merely type <code>volo deploy</code>, and have it
optimize the code, and copy only the changed files to the remote server.</p>

<p>As a side-project, I’ve been working on a prototype which is heavily based on
<a href="https://people.mozilla.com/~bwinton/australis-customization/customizationMode-liveDemo-i02.html">a demo page</a> from Stephen Horlander.  Now, that page is
pretty amazing, but if you look at the source (using command-u or control-u in
Firefox, and command-alt-u or control-alt-u in Chrome), you’ll see a lot of code
that looks like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"menuPanelButton subscribeButton"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"button"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"label"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Subscribe<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre>


<p>and:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"customizeToolbarItem"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"customizeToolbarItemIcon share"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"customizeToolbarItemLabel"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Share<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre>


<p>Now, one or two of those would be fine, but when we get into more than that, the
repetition really starts to bug me, and I think “Wouldn’t it be better if I
could just write stuff like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;panel-button</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"subscribe"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Subscribe<span class="nt">&lt;/panel-button&gt;</span>
…
<span class="nt">&lt;toolbar-item</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"share"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Share<span class="nt">&lt;/toolbar-item&gt;</span>
</pre>


<p>instead?”  And it turns out I can, using a new library called
<a href="http://mozilla.github.com/x-tag/">x-tag</a>!  The first thing I need to do is
register the new tags I’ll be using.  That’s done with code like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="c1">// These first two lines are here because I’m using require.js, which I’ll</span>
<span class="c1">// talk about in a future blog post…</span>

<p>The second step is to replace all the old html with the new tags.  (I did
that, too, of course.)  And there we go.  That’s it.  In the file I was
modifying, the combination of that and moving the javascript out into a
separate file took the html from 275 lines down to 146 lines, and let me more
easily change the buttons around, and add new ones.  I call that a win, and
from now on, whenever I see large blocks of repeated html, I’m going to be
seriously tempted to switch them to an x-tag!</p>
<p>One caveat I will mention is that in my first attempt, I tried to use both the
<code>content</code> property, and the <code>onCreate</code> method, and that totally didn’t work,
since the content would be replaced by the value of the content property long
before I had a chance to muck around with it in the onCreate.  So in the future,
I think I’ll just jump straight into using the onCreate method, since it’s not
that much harder.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, I watched <a href="https://air.mozilla.org/apps-templates-dev-ecosystem-tools/">a video</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/jlongster">James Long</a> about <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mortar">Mortar</a>, which is a template for making HTML 5 Open Web Apps.  Now, coincidentally, I’m starting a new project (in my spare time, obviously, since it’s a Sunday), and while it’s not an Open Web App, I saw no reason not to use the <a href="https://github.com/volojs/volo">same</a> <a href="http://requirejs.org/">tools</a> they were using.</p>
<p>Of course, since nothing’s easy, I ran into a problem pretty quickly.  My problem was that every time I tried to <code>require("jquery-ui");</code>, I got an error of “ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined”.  There wasn’t a lot of information about how to fix it, so after most of an afternoon mucking around, I finally came up with something that seems to work, and thought I would post it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go into your <code>www/js/lib</code> directory.</li>
<li><code>curl -O https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.18/jquery-ui.js</code></li>
<li>Edit the jquery-ui.js file.  At the top add the line <code>define(["jquery"], function (jQuery) {</code>, and at the bottom, add the line <code>});</code>.</li>
<li>That’s it.  From there you should be good to go!</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I suspect there’s a better way to do this, and hopefully <a href="https://twitter.com/jrburke">James</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/clarkbw">Bryan</a> will jump in the comments and tell me what it is, but for now, at least this works.</p>

<p>I was recently offered the opportunity to work on a very cool project. At the
moment I'm finishing up <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/">AOSA</a> and working
on another book, plus I am taking a six week online course, but this new
project didn't start until late summer, so I agreed.</p>
<p>Or so I thought. There was some confusion on my part, and as it turns out, the
new project starts right away. There's no way I want to pass up this
opportunity, though, so I'm going to have to squeeze some more hours out of my
day. Somehow.</p>
<p>My first intention is to spend the first part of the work day on billable work.
It sounds dumb, but I have so many other things to do — answering email,
administration, networking, blog posts, AOSA, volunteer work for the girls'
school, the course, and household jobs like signing the girls up for things
— that some days I don't do any billable work at all. As a result my
projects drag on and I feel like a dud. </p>
<p>My second intention is to wake up at 6:00 every day. Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays I will go straight to the gym so I can work out before breakfast;
Tuesdays and Thursdays I will do housework and household admin tasks, so they
don't eat into my working day. That means I have to head to bed at 10:15 to be
asleep by 10:45. (Seven hours and fifteen minutes seems to be enough sleep.) I
hope I will settle in to that sleep cycle so that I wake up early on the
weekends, too; that time I will use to read!</p>
<p>My third intention is to finish the AOSA project in one fell swoop. I'm waiting
on a volunteer to create the epub (thank you!) and once that's done I will set
aside a day or two to finish all the little admin and website jobs
which I could otherwise safely (but guiltily) ignore forever.</p>
<p>And finally I have a bad habit of half-watching TV, half-working in the
evenings. I hope I will be more effective with this new schedule and won't need
to work in the evenings. If there's something on I actually want to watch, I
intend to set aside other things and watch it (!); if I'm just keeping Blake
company while he watches something I'm not so interested in, I will work on
personal or family stuff.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to fit all the things I want to
do into my day (and cursing my excessive need for sleep.) I'm optimistic about
this plan; it seems both doable and effective.</p>
<p>(Check it out: no sooner did I post this than I came across this book about
what successful people do <a href="http://lauravanderkam.com/books/successful-people-breakfast/">before
breakfast</a>.)</p>

<p>The Victoria Day long weekend took me by surprise this year — I didn't
realize it was a long weekend until last Thursday. However, I had planned to do
the thing that every other Canadian with a yard does this weekend: garden.</p>
<p>Saturday morning Delphine and I had decided to go yard saleing. Our original
plan was to take our bikes, but then I realized that Blake goes spinning on
Saturday morning, so we would have to take Cordelia with us. She still hasn't
learned how to ride a bike (and seems to be in no hurry to) so that meant we
had to walk.</p>
<p>Noramlly that would have been fine because there are usually plenty of yard
sales within walking distance, but of course it's the long weekend. We only
found one sale, and it didn't open until 9:00 (even though everyone knows that
the universal standard yard sale starting time is 8:00). So we walked over to
Bayview instead, where nothing was open except bakeries and cafes.
However, on the way home someone had curbed a small collection of tiny wooden
painted cats — exactly the kind of thing the girls were looking for.
So they got what they wanted, and we got to keep all our money.</p>
<p>Delphine had her piano lesson at 10:00, and then we all went to the
newly-opened Mount Pleasant outpost of <a href="http://www.yelp.ca/biz/hazels-diner-toronto">Hazel's Diner</a>.  We have
been diner-less since Diner 55 on Bayview closed, so we were ridiculously
excited to go to Hazel's.  There weren't many people there, what with it being
the long weekend, but we saw two other Cody families — I think this 
location will do well. The food was good (not like it's hard to screw up a
diner breakfast, unless you try and make it vegan or something) and I like
the look of their lunch selection, too.</p>
<p>After Hazel's we headed home to do our homeowner penance: gardening.  The girls
and I had shopped for soil and plants after school on Friday (on Baba's advice,
to beat the crowds and get the best selection).  So while Delphine planted her
planter in the front — some alliums (I think, or something similar),
English daisies and sweet alyssum — Blake trimmed the hedge and I edged
the "lawn".  Cordelia did odd jobs like picking up twigs and fetching stuff.
Then Blake mowed and Delphine weeded the strip where the creeping jenny is
supposed to grow. </p>
<p>Then we all moved to the back where Cordelia and I planted our planters.  I
bought three <a href="http://www.leevalley.com/en/garden/page.aspx?p=69037&amp;cat=2,51603">fabric
planters</a> for our deck. I much prefer to plant planters than try and grow
things in the garden, which I find anarchic and upsetting.  Cordelia was
assigned one fabric planter, Blake was assigned two, and I got the two wooden
planters that match the deck.</p>
<p>Cordelia planted a geranium (red), two miniature roses (red and pink) and a
gerbera daisy (yellow). I added a red geranium and a white callibrachoa to a
planter which is playing host to a sage plant I put in three years ago which
refuses to die and in fact grows bigger and stronger every year. In the other
planter I have two geraniums (fuchsia and red), a yellow callibrachoa, a
firewitch Dianthus ("Feuerhexe", because everything sounds cooler in German)
and some other things which weren't labelled — I think they're also
pinks. I don't believe in colour-coordinated planting.</p>
<p>Blake gets to plant the other two fabric planters — he wants to grow
tomatoes and basil — but he hasn't bought the stuff yet.</p>
<p>That was the easy part. By that time the kids were sick of gardening (okay,
so was I) so they went to Ursa's place to play in the sprinkler while I
tackled the rest of the garden — the anarchic bit —
and Blake made pizza dough.</p>
<p>When we moved in to this house the garden was a standard garden with 
recognizable beds and a bit of lawn. Since then the lawn and the beds have
kind of melded together, with lots of weeds to add colour and texture. My
gardening consists of weed whacking twice a year to keep the weeds and
overgrown lawn below knee height. </p>
<p>This time I thought, since it was so early in the year, I would be able to mow
it with the push mower. But we've had such a ridiculously early and warm spring
that the lawn was a foot tall, and just folded over and laughed. I much prefer
violets and creeping charlie to lawn: they only grow a few inches high no
matter how long you leave them, and when you do mow them they send up lovely
purple and green confetti.</p>
<p>So I fought with the grass, cussing and sweating, until I had tackled most of 
the yard. It looks at least 78% less hill-billy-ish now. By then Blake, my
very bestest husband ever, had brought me a Frappuccino, so I got to sit on 
the deck and enjoy my non-embarrassing back yard.</p>
<p>After a delicious dinner of pizza, made by Blake and Delphine, the kids took a
bath and were off to bed at a reasonable hour.</p>
<p>Sunday morning the girls have swimming lessons at a local high school. The
lessons are an hour, so I get to sit up in the gallery and chill out, or this
week, work on the <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/">AOSA</a> website.</p>
<p>After swimming we hit Subway for lunch (having spent almost all our family
fun money at Hazel's) and then went to Boardsports to get Delphine a helmet
to go with her new skateboard. She wanted a pink helmet, but they only had
extra-small in pink so she chose a gorgeous matte grass-green one instead. Then
we walked home; Cordelia was exhausted halfway home — normally she has
energy to spare, but she was sick last week and it's still slowing her down.</p>
<p>So in the afternoon we chilled out on the couch and watched a Mythbusters
— the one with the explosions and shooting. And then Baba and Zaida's
for barbequed steaks and playing in Auntie Morgan's wading pool.</p>
<p>On Monday we went for a hike. I like to take Delphine out in nature sometimes,
because it recharges her (and me, too). Toronto is great for that because
there are little bits of nature all over the place, so you can have, if not
the best of both urban and country life, at least a taste of nature in the city.</p>
<p>We've done the walk down to the Brickworks, and we've walked from Yonge
and Lawrence to Bayview at Sunnybrook Hospital. I wanted to do something new
this time. I thought about Leslie Spit, but that takes too long to get to
— I wanted this to be a morning hike so the girls could play with Ursa in
the afternoon. I thought about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crothers_Woods">Crother's Woods</a>, but
it's a bit of a pain to get to. There are two bus routes which access it, but
neither of them are near our place. So finally we decided to walk from
Sunnybrook Hospital to the Ontario Science Centre. </p>
<p>Sunnybrook is a short bus ride from our house, so we were there before ten.
It was a nice hike, but too much walking on paved paths through parks for me.
I like hikes through the woods. There were some trails through the woods
which ran parallel to the park paths, though, so we got some quality nature
hiking in. I think we went too fast; there are so many interesting things to
look at in the woods if you slow down and pay attention. But as it was we saw a
woodpecker, a nuthatch, baby geese, and a toad, and lots of cool fungus. Also
far too much garlic mustard.</p>
<p>Our destination was the Ontario Science Centre, and I can't think of a better
place to end a hike. We had lunch (fish and chips for the girls, chicken
satay on a pita for me and jerk pork for Blake, then ice creams all 'round)
and checked out the circus exhibit before catching the bus home.</p>
<p>Then we sent the girls off to Ursa's and now Blake's doing I-don't-know-what
while I sit on the deck writing this. Tonight we are going to a local street
party for hot dogs and fireworks. Not bad for a long weekend I didn't even know
was coming.</p>

<p>Back in November I got a call from one of the special education teachers at the
school — Delphine's teacher this year and her grade two teacher had both
flagged her to be assessed for the gifted program.</p>
<p>There's no gifted program at the girls' school — the program for gifted
kids is hosted at another school, so attending would require a daily bus ride. 
The special ed teacher said that Delphine was eligible for the gifted
assessment, but that if we wouldn't consider sending her to the gifted program
we shouldn't have her assessed, since the assessment is "resource-intensive".</p>
<p>We really like our neighbourhood school, Delphine loves her friends, and she
gets carsick, so I declined the assessment.</p>
<p>I had heard from a friend who works for the school board that if your child is
assessed as gifted you can get an IEP (individual education plan), which seemed
to be the best solution. An IEP provides specific guidance to the classroom
teacher, so Delphine could stay at her school while still getting the extra
enrichment she needs to thrive.</p>
<p>I've been talking with Delphine's teacher about this all year, and a few weeks
ago she finally arranged a team meeting to discuss Delphine's case. The team
meeting was supposed to involve us, Delphine's teacher, the principal and
vice-principal, the special ed teacher, and a psychologist from the school
board. That seemed like a bit of overkill to me, and apparently everyone else
agreed because only the vice principal, a special ed teacher and Delphine's
classroom teacher ended up attending.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure what would come of this meeting; I wanted to get the lay of the
land, see what our options were, and talk about an IEP.</p>
<p>The IEP idea was shot down immediately. Apparently gifted students used to be
eligible for IEPs, but no longer. That leaves the bus-in gifted program, or, as
the special ed teacher said, we can "cross our fingers" and "hope" that next
year Delphine gets a teacher who understands the needs of gifted children.</p>
<p>I don't know how parents of other kids with special needs would feel if their
team meeting included the words "cross our fingers" and "hope", but I'm not
particularly happy about it. It's as irresponsible to neglect gifted kids as it
is to neglect kids with other special needs.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what our next move is. I'm reading up on gifted children because
I'm woefully uneducated in this matter, so hopefully next time I meet with the
"team" I'll be able to advocate more intelligently for my girl. We might
consider the bus-in program, since Delphine's very best friend is thinking
about going to another school for Extended French, which releases one of her
ties to the neighbourhood school. (At least we can visit the
gifted program so Delphine has an idea of the possibilities.) We're
contemplating other specialised programs, like the TDSB Vocal Academy; that
would be valuable and enriching in some ways but still wouldn't directly
address Delphine's needs as a gifted learner.</p>
<p>This isn't one of those satisfying blog posts with a useful conclusion. I have
no idea where we're going from here, I just know I'm not satisfied with the
path we're on. </p>

    <div>
<p>Last night Delphine and I went to the opera. This March Break Delphine attended
Opera Camp at the <a href="http://coc.ca">COC</a>, and one of the perks was
a pair of tickets to the dress rehearsal of the opera she studied at camp,
Puccini's <em>Gianni Schicchi</em>. It's an opera in one act, and the other
half of the bill was
Alexander Zemlinsky's <em>A Florentine Tragedy</em>.</p>
<p>The Zemlinsky was first, which put a bit of a spanner into our plan to 
leave at intermission in case of extreme boredom or fatigue. Fortunately
there was neither,
despite <em>A Florentine Tragedy</em> being a bit, um, challenging.</p>
<p>Delphine and I read the synopses over before the show and decided <em>A
Florentine Tragedy</em> sounded more like a comedy. A merchant walks in on his
wife and her lover. (Delphine says "boyfriend".) The merchant decides the wife
isn't really having an affair, so he tries to sell the other man some
merchandise. The boyfriend says sure, he'll buy it and then offers the merchant
even more money.  The merchant says the boyfriend can have the whole house! The
boyfriend says he wants the wife! The man says his wife is only good for
housework, and then tells her to sew something! (Actually spin, but Delphine
thought sew.) The men drink wine and then fight, and the man kills the
boyfriend. The wife says, "I didn't realize you were so strong!", and the man
says, "I didn't realize you were so beautiful!" Their love is renewed!</p>
<p>(It makes much more sense now that I know it's based on a play by Oscar
Wilde.)</p>
<p>After we had a giggle at the synopsis we watched the real thing. Delphine
is very attentive at musical performances, and she was rapt through the whole
show — except at the end with the fighting, when she "shut up", as she
calls it: closed her eyes and blocked her ears.</p>
<p>As I said, it was pretty challenging: discordant and free of any melody to
speak of, grim and dark. But we've been going to <a href="http://www.mooredaleconcerts.com/Music-and-Truffles.html">Music and
Truffles</a> for a few years, and they're not shy about throwing all kinds of
crazy music at kids; Delphine doesn't seem to mind it.  The direction and
staging was interesting — the acting was stylized and melodramatic, with
many poses being struck. At several points the performers created dramatic
shadows and silhouettes.</p>
<p>After the show ("That was creepy.") we met up with Tanya and Ursa and
explored the Four Seasons Centre. We asked the girls if they wanted to 
stay for the second show, and there was jumping and glee. </p>
<p><em>Gianni Schicchi</em> was entirely opposite to <em>A Florentine
Tragedy</em>: Italian, not German; sunny, not dark;  comic, not tragic; a cast
of many compared with a cast of three; natural rather than melodramatic acting.
It was a perfect double-bill for the circumstances: if the girls never go to
another opera they will have a pretty good idea of what opera is about.</p>
<p>The direction for <em>Schicchi</em> was great — broad without
being ridiculous. Special credit goes to the supernumary playing
Buoso Donati, who had to die in the first few minutes of the opera and
then be manipulated for the rest of the show, ultimately being
wrapped up and folded into a sofa bed.</p>
<p>Also in the opera were Simone Osborne playing Lauretta, who was
adorable (and sung beautifully) and Peter McGillivray as Marco. He's
performed with my choir a couple of times and is also great. I also
enjoyed the performance of Marco's wife, La Ciesca, by Rihab Chaieb.
And everyone else was really good, too. (Not that I'm a connoisseur
— I'm pretty happy as long as no-one goes flat or falls off the
stage.)</p>
<p>The show ended around 10:00 and we were home by 11:00, which is the latest
Delphine has ever been up, ever. She was hungry (if you stay up late
enough you get hungry all over again!) so we had a piece of toast and
went off to bed, full of the satisfaction of an adventure successfully
completed.</p>

<p>I think what I want is pretty simple, or at least, reasonably common.
I’m just looking for a couple of programs.</p>
<p>An SMTP server which will accept mail for the accounts at latte.ca, and deliver
it to a Maildir of my choosing, and let me send mail through it if, and only if,
I’ve logged in with the password to that account.  (Being able to define a few
aliases would also be nice.)</p>
<p>And an IMAP server which will expose the previously-mentioned Maildir, after
I’ve logged in with the password to that account.</p>
<p>And yet, every time I try to set that up, something completely falls over for no
particularly understandable reason, and I end up wasting an afternoon (or more)
of my life.  I had hoped this time would be different, since I decided not to
install and configure everything myself, but instead bought a copy of OS X Lion
Server which was supposed to do all the hard work for me.  I’m not going to
enumerate all the problems I ran into, but I will say that I still haven’t
managed to get there.  I’m just done for tonight.</p>
<p>Anyways, if anyone reading this has a working setup that meets the requirements
(and the added requirement of needing to use Dovecot and Postfix, since those
are what’s installed), I would love to get a copy of their config files.  And in
the meantime, I might seriously look into getting a refund for Lion Server,
given how badly it’s failed me.  :P</p>
