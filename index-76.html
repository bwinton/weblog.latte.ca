<p>Here's a recipe for Apricot Prune Kugel for Passover. Baba said
she isn't making kugel this year because she's making a turkey and
stuffing it and the stuffing is just the same as kugel. So I'll make
kugel. </p>
<p>I looked for the recipe and couldn't find it, so I asked on Twitter but
no-one's suggestion looked quite right. (Kugel means different things to
different people.) Then I looked in my cookbook again and realized the recipe
was just formatted weird, and I actually do have it.  So I'm posting it here
for the interest of googlers everywhere.</p>
<h5>Ingredients</h5>
<ul>
<li>16 dried apricots</li>
<li>12 prunes</li>
<li>2 heaping cups matzo farfel</li>
<li>¼ cup oil</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1 cup raisins</li>
<li>juice of 1 lemon</li>
<li>½ cup sugar</li>
<li>1 apple, grated fine</li>
<li>1 cup orange juice</li>
</ul>
<h5>Instructions</h5>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Soak the apricots and prunes in hot water (I don't know for how long)
and then drain and chop them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour hot water over farfel; drain. Add oil and egg. Mix in fruit and
all other ingredients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn into square baking dish. Bake at 350°C for about 1 hour.</p>

<p>Since my <a href="delphine/gifted.html">last post on this topic</a> I've met
with Andrea, a friend of a friend who is an expert on special education and
works at the TDSB. She very kindly allowed me to pick her brain, and I learned
plenty. Apart from lots of advice and insight on how gifted education is
handled in the TDSB, she had two concrete suggestions: to seriously consider
the TDSB gifted program, and to ask Delphine’s teacher specifically how he is
differentiating for her.</p>
<p>(Differentiated education is something they ask teachers to do these days,
where basically every child gets their own special curriculum. It’s how they
justify combining ages and abilities within one classroom: the teacher is
supposed to assess the ability of each child in their class and provide each
and every one of them with assignments and materials that suit their level. You
might infer that I am skeptical as to the practicality of this system.)</p>
<p>We had every intention of getting Delphine assessed for giftedness, because you
basically can’t ask for anything without having that rubber stamp. But from
talking to other parents I got the impression that the gifted program, which is
at a school a few neighbourhoods away, would not be suitable for Delphine. So
we had written off the possibility of the gifted program and hoped that the
rubber stamp could be put to use some other way. But Andrea urged me to be
open-minded and check out the program ourselves. And she’s absolutely right;
neither Delphine nor I know what the program is really like nor whether it will
suit her in ways that she can’t even articulate. So we’re going to, at least,
go and visit.</p>
<p>We met with Delphine’s teacher in November as part of the regular
parent-teacher interviews, and I did ask him how he’s differentiating the
program for her. He said something like, “I’m not going to offer her anything
different until I’ve seen that she can do the assigned work to a better
standard.” He doesn’t like the quality of her work — it’s messy and she
doesn’t go the extra mile to produce really great work. She meets the
requirement of the assignments without adding <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5YClmS3umk">flair</a>.</p>
<p>Of course this decision on the part of the teacher is deeply unsatisfying to
me. An education that is suited to your ability is a not a carrot to be dangled
in front of you as a reward for jumping through arbitrary hoops of the
teacher's devising: tidy handwriting, sitting still, completing assignments to
a level beyond that asked. </p>
<p>I guess it does make a certain, superficial sense; I've mentioned this to a few
people and they've said it seems fair. But it isn't really, when you think
about it. There's no real connection between being tidy, or putting a great
deal of effort into an arbitrary tast, and needing (or deserving) to be
challenged intellectually.  Both of those are useful skills to have (the first
probably more than the second) but neither of them have to do with being smart,
and it doesn't make sense to connect one to the other. Just because she's not
particularly strong in these areas is no reason to deprive her of stimulation
in other areas.</p>
<p>And besides, an education suited to the student’s level is a legal entitlement
in Ontario.</p>
<p>(We haven't even considered that she might not be completing the assignments to
the teacher's standard because she's not really very interested in them —
because they're too easy or because they're on a topic that doesn't interest
her, or because she wants to save her limited energy for an endeavor that's of
more interest to her.  Of course the question of whether she can apply focus
and determination and effort to a project which <em>is</em> important to her is
another matter, and one which doesn't seem to be resolved within the
traditional school system.)</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons we are interested in an IEP; because it's a document
which requires that teachers offer her an education that suits her ability
level, without having to adhere to the teacher's idea of what's suitable for a
gifted child, or what should be required of a child before they get the
education that they need. Of course this leads to the question of whether we
want to establish an adversarial relationship with our teachers before we've
even established any other kind of relationship.</p>
<p>The story continues but this post has been sitting on my hard drive for a
while. More to come...</p>

<p>Lately Cordelia and I have been going through the
folder of completed work her teacher sent home at the end 
of grade one. (She's four months into grade two at the moment; one
day I hope to catch up.)</p>
<p>One of the exercises they did last year was to figure out how you
can "make" particular numbers; that is, what two numbers add up to
a number.</p>
<p>It took her a little while to catch on:</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/cordeliaMath/make7.jpg" alt="Make 7" width="500px"><br>
2 + 5 makes 7. A red dancing yeti + 2 purple eggs makes 7?</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/cordeliaMath/make8.jpg" alt="Make 8" width="500px"><br>
8 + 2 makes... damn. Okay, 5 + 3 makes 8.</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/cordeliaMath/make9.jpg" alt="Make 9" width="500px"><br>
Ah, now she's got it. 6 + 3 makes 9; 1 + 8 makes 9!</p>
<p>Now it's time for her to do it by herself: choose a number and show how to
"make" it two different ways. But Cordelia is Blake's daughter, so her
additional challenge is to do that correctly while also doing as
little work as possible. I think she nailed it:</p>

<p>Sydney's Playground is the new natural(ish) kindergarten playground at 
Maurice Cody Elementary school. It's named for one of our kindergarteners, who
was killed in a traffic crash while we were in the process of planning the
playground. (This post isn't about Sydney, but it seemed weird to write 
about the playground without mentioning her.)</p>
<p>This post is about the process of designing and building a natural playground
in a TDSB school. When we embarked on the process of building a natural
playground at Maurice Cody there was very little guidance on how to go about
building a playground, so I am writing this in the hope that it will help
someone else. </p>
<p>The caveat is that your mileage may vary: I am not sure how
consistent the TDSB is in terms of policies and processes, and for all I know
your experience will be completely different. Even if it is, I hope this post
gives you some idea of what's possible and what's likely to happen. But
first...</p>
<h5>A Little About Natural Playgrounds</h5>

<p>A <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=natural+playground">natural
playground</a> is a playground built with natural elements instead of
artificial play structures. They are desirable for various reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Being in a natural environment has been shown to improve concentration
and learning</p></li>
<li><p>Unstructured play elements are better for imaginative play in much the
same way that plain Lego blocks are more demanding than Lego kits with
funny shaped blocks and instructions</p></li>
<li><p>Natural elements like logs and rocks are theoretically less expensive
than manufactured play structures</p></li>
</ul>
<h5>What The TDSB Will Do For You</h5>
<p>Our school is one of the few in the TDSB that's growing, and a couple of years
ago the school board built a second playground for the nine kindergarten
classes. When I say "built" I mean they fenced off an area, built some stairs
and put down some mulch. You may not realize this — I certainly didn't
— but the TDSB is not in the playground-building business. Despite having
your 3-, 4- and 5-year-olds in their care for six hours a day, and despite the
massive importance of outside play and gross motor activity for early childhood
development, the TDSB does not build playgrounds. They do landscaping, hence
the fencing and mulch, but they don't do playgrounds.</p>
<p>That's up to you, the parents. You have to decide to build a playground, you
have to guide and help manage the consultation and design process and you have
to raise the money.</p>
<p>So there we were with the outline of a playground, and since I was 
eco-committee chair at the time I suggested we should take the opportunity
to build a natural playground. The idea was greeted with various
degrees of enthusiasm; I think mostly people were just glad someone
was doing something about what the kids had named "the nothing playground".</p>
<p>I'm going through the years — literally — of emails on this topic
and I think I had better give you the condensed version. (I sent my very first
email about the natural playground in January 2010, and we finished the
playground in August 2012.)</p>
<p>So here's the compressed, idealized process, with advice.</p>
<h5>1. Get Your Ducks (And Your Dollars) In A Row</h5>
<p>First you need to decide you're going to do it. You'll have to sell your
parents, your administration and your teachers on a natural playground.
(I didn't have any trouble with that up front, although there was some
pushback later when people realized what a natural playground actually meant,
and I had to explain the concepts over and over.)</p>
<p>Next you need to meet with your community — teachers, parents, staff
— and talk about what you want from the playground. Both from a
high-level, philosophical angle and also about the specifics of what you want:
A slide?  An outdoor classroom? A sand box? Make sure everyone has been
included and that you all roughly agree on what you want. You have to do this
<em>before</em> you come to the table with the TDSB playground designers.</p>
<p>This was one of the most frustrating parts for me, because I didn't feel
we were in any position to make these decisions: we didn't have either
a landscape architect or a playground designer on our team and we had no
idea what was possible or desirable. But the TDSB wants you to have
met, discussed and agreed before you come to them.</p>
<p>They also want you to have $10 000. Or at least, that's the sum we had
to pony up to prove that we were serious about funding a playground.</p>
<p>Once you have expressed your interest in building a playground, there will be a
meeting with the TDSB groundskeeping staff, the school administration, and
representatives of parents and of teachers. This meeting tripped us up
because the kindergarten staff just sent whichever random teacher was available,
and that teacher hadn't been to any of our previous meetings. So she had no clue
what the concept of a natural playground was and I spent half the meeting
explaining it to her and telling her why we didn't actually want those bouncy
spring toys or another playhouse.  As a result we looked like we hadn't
consulted at all, and we got a stern talking-to from the TDSB designer. She
didn't want to hear from us again until we had consensus on what we wanted.</p>
<p>Don't make the same mistake. Make sure everyone involved understands what
you want.</p>
<h5>2. Get To Know Evergreen</h5>
<p>You know <a href="http://www.evergreen.ca/">Evergreen</a>: they're the people
behind the <a href="http://ebw.evergreen.ca/">Brickworks</a>, where you go for
fresh organic produce (or waffles and French fries, if you're me) at their <a href="http://ebw.evergreen.ca/farmers-market">Farmer's Market</a>, to <a href="http://ebw.evergreen.ca/whats-on/bike-works">fix your bike</a>, and where
your kids can look for turtles and make stuff in <em>their</em> natural playground, <a href="http://ebw.evergreen.ca/whats-on/kids-families/chimney-court">Chimney
Court</a>.</p>
<p>But Evergreen also works very closely <a href="http://www.evergreen.ca/en/programs/schools/school-boards.sn">with the
TDSB</a> to do <a href="http://www.evergreen.ca/en/programs/schools/index.sn">schoolyard
greening</a> and playground development. I'm not sure exactly how their
relationship works, but several people we worked with seemed to be employed by
both Evergreen and the TDSB.</p>
<p>Evergreen is also a source of grants, through their <a href="http://www.evergreen.ca/en/funding/grants/telg.sn">Toyota Evergreen
Learning Grounds School Ground Greening Grants</a>, which is available to pay
for plants and certain playground elements.</p>
<h5>3. Be Flexible</h5>
<p>Once you have furnished the $10 000 and convinced the TDSB you have some
consensus on what you want, they will assign you a landscape architect (no, you
don't get to decide who your landscape architect is) and you'll meet with them.
By now I think a few schools have attempted to build natural playgrounds, so
you shouldn't have to spend too much time explaining what you want and why.
But when you're going through the design process, keep in mind what a "natural
playground" means to your team, and be prepared to be flexible about what yours
will include.</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/playground/climber.jpg" align="left" alt="Rope climber" title="This is the climber this summer, before the safety surfacing was
installed."></p>
<p>For example, a playground needs a climbing structure, to help develop balance
and upper-body strength. Some natural climbing structures are, for example,
really large rocks and trees. There is no way we could afford really large
rocks, and trees freak out teachers. So we ended up looking for a manufactured
climbing structure. At one point during our design meetings we had to choose
between an abstract rope climbing structure and a "fort". Neither are natural,
but we chose the rope structure because it satisfied our requirement of being
abstract and, for want of a better phrase, narratively neutral.  It can be a
tent, a rocket, a tree... The fort might be a castle or a house but it's always
a building — a manufactured simulacrum of a manufactured structure.</p>
<p>Even after we had been working with the concept of a natural playground for a
long time, some members of the team didn't get it. At one point the quote for
the playground came back much higher than we anticipated, and we had to look at
cutting some elements. One of our team members was very put out that we would
only have "two pieces of equipment" in the playground, meaning the slide and
the climber. Those, of course, were the two manufactured elements. She was
overlooking the retaining walls (a.k.a., balance beams, fortresses,
tightropes), the log benches (a.k.a., balance beams, dragons, mountains, blast
shields), the sand box, the rocks (a.k.a., icebergs, dinner tables, space
ships, go-carts), and everything else that didn't come in a big box labelled
"fun play equipment".</p>
<h5>4. Think Long-Term</h5>
<p>One important consideration was the expected lack of maintenance. Basically
with a TDSB playground, it gets installed and that's it until it's time to take
it down and put up something else. Of course the staff will repair things when
they break, but you can't include a cool <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/54/157107196_9d061e8dae.jpg">willow
tunnel</a> or anything that needs a lot of attention as it grows, and if you
put in planter boxes you'd better be damn sure someone is committed to
maintaining them. Bear in mind that even if the current community of parents is
committed to maintaining the playground, the next generation may not be. You
don't want to install something that's going to become a liability or an
eyesore.</p>
<h5>5. Try To Keep Your Patience</h5>
<p>Working with the TDSB was frustrating at times. It's such a large, cumbersome
organization that there doesn't seem to be good communication even within
it, let alone with the rest of the world. Three examples of this:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
It's hard to figure out which playground equipment suppliers you can use.
At one point we tried to get a list of TDSB-approved suppliers, and it seems
there is no such list. But you can't purchase equipment from just anyone.  What
we ended up doing was giving pictures of stuff we liked to the landscape
architect, and she sourced similar elements from providers she knew were
approved.</p></li>

<li>
<p>
We had one really fantastic meeting toward the end of the design process.
All the interested parties were there: designer, grounds staff, administration,
parents, teachers, and Sydney's father. It was the meeting where we made all
the final design decisions, including the specific elements and colours we
wanted.  We had two design principals: to keep the playground visually natural,
and to incorporate pink, which was Sydney's favourite colour. We chose a pink
slide and complemented it with a green frog sculpture. We also chose red for
the climbing structure (because red is kind of like pink?), and tan for the
rubbery safety surfacing around the slide and climber.  Lovely, right?
</p>

<img src="images/amy/playground/redred.jpg" align="right" alt="Red climber, red surface, clashy clashy" title="I hope you like this red colour, because that's what you're getting."><p>
Well, it turns out the TDSB only uses a brick red colour for the safety
surfacing, at all their schools. We didn't find that out until they installed
it. You can imagine how great brick red looks with a pink slide and red rope
climber. If we had known that — if the TDSB staff who was at the meeting
had known that — we would have made different choices for the colours.
</p>

<p>
(Incidentally, when the frog arrived she wasn't green, she was grey. 
I don't know where the screw-up was: was she ordered wrong? Was she manufactured
wrong?)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I wanted logs. Logs are such an obvious element in a natural playground. But
the TDSB Grounds Team Leader didn't like logs. He said they attract carpenter
ants and wasps, they're a liability and no-one wants to pay to have them
removed when they rot. I had visited a playground which was built 15 years ago
and had no problems with their logs, but he was quite adamant that logs were
not an option. We ended up looking at fake logs made out of cement.</p>

<img src="images/amy/playground/logs2.jpg" align="left" alt="Logs, bark still on, not on gravel"><p>
And then suddenly, after months of no logs, logs <em>were</em> an option. I'm not sure
what changed, but at that same meeting when we decided on the colours, the Grounds Team leader said that he had
a source for nice hardwood logs that wouldn't rot. He said they remove the bark
from the logs, and if they install them on gravel so they're well-drained
there's no concern about rotting. Great! Let's have logs! I was really happy
about the logs.</p>

<p>And then the logs were installed. As you can see, they do not have the bark
stripped from them, and they are not installed on nice, well-drained gravel. I
have no idea what went wrong there, but obviously the Grounds Team leader's
specifications for logs were either not communicated, or not met. I'm not even
sure if the logs were from the same provider he was thinking of.</p>

<hr width="40%">
<p>So did we end up with a natural playground? Kind of half-and-half. The
playground has lots of natural elements, including the trees which were already
there, some new shrubs we planted, the problematic logs, rocks, wooden
landscaping elements like retaining walls, stone seating, and a slide built
into a natural slope in the playground.  We also have some unnatural elements,
like the surfacing, which is required around the slide according to safety
regulations (even though the slide is at ground level!) and the climber.
And we have the frog, which is kind of emblematic of nature and just
really sweet.</p>
<p><img src="images/amy/playground/slide.jpg" align="right" alt="Slide" title="As
you can see, the pink slide clashes with the red surfacing, but fortunately the
sandbox sand (which is about the colour of the surfacing we did want) kind of
creeps up the slope and looks better than the red."></p>
<p>Between the safety considerations, the limitations on providers, the lack of
maintenance, and the lack of understanding of the concept of natural
playgrounds, it would be very hard to have a truly natural playground in the
TDSB. But if you communicate the concepts <em>behind</em> a natural playground clearly
to your school community and convince them it's a good idea, you can get pretty
close, and you can definitely install a playground which provides a rich,
natural environment for your children to learn and grow in.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact me if you want more information about building
natural playgrounds or if you would like a tour of Sydney's Playground.</p>

    </header><div class="p-summary entry-summary">
    <div>
<p>For a while now, I’ve been having problems with my Firefox profile.  To be fair,
it’s mostly because of random <a href="about:config">about:config</a> tweaks I’ve made, but
still, not being able to test the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2012/11/20/firefox-introduces-new-social-api-and-previews-integration-with-facebook/">new SocialAPI</a> stuff was pretty annoying.  So I decided to try <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/reset-firefox-easily-fix-most-problems">resetting my profile</a>,
to clear out all the junk, and hopefully even make it a little faster.</p>
<p>But, as the page I linked to just up there mentions, resetting your profile will
lose your open tabs, windows and tab groups, which kinda sucks, because I have
57 open tabs, in various groups, and I really don’t want to lose them!
Fortunately, I’m a programmer, so I hacked on Firefox to get it to save and
restore my tabs, and now I’m a happy camper!</p>
<p>A couple of days later, one of my co-workers had some similar problems, and also
wanted to re-set his profile to try and fix them.  I hadn’t saved the results of
my hacking, so I had to re-create it for him from a combination of memory and
the documentation.  The new code I came up with looked something like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">gBrowser</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">tabs</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">rv</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"var tabs = [\n"</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">rv</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="s1">'  "'</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nx">linkedBrowser</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">contentWindow</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">location</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">'",\n'</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nx">rv</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="s1">'];\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; tabs.length; i++ ) {\n'</span>
<span class="nx">rv</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="s1">'  gBrowser.addTab(tabs[i]);\n}\n'</span>
</pre>


<p>To run it, first open <a href="about:config">about:config</a>, and make sure the
<code>devtools.chrome.enabled</code> preference is set to <code>true</code> (double-click it if it
isn’t, and it should switch automatically), then go to the <code>Tools » Web
Developer » Scratchpad</code> menu item, which should open up a small new window with
some javascript comments in it.  While that window is focused, click on
<code>Environment » Browser</code>, to make sure that you’re running the code in the
browser’s chrome (instead of in the page’s content).  Paste the code in, and
click <code>Execute » Display</code>.</p>
<p>That should result in a bunch of code in grey surrounded by <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> that
looks like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">tabs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
<span class="s2">"http://weblog.latte.ca/blake"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="s2">"http://breakingtheegg.tumblr.com/"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">];</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="nx">tabs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">gBrowser</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addTab</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">tabs</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">]);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre>


<p>Copy that out of the scratchpad into your favourite editor, remove the <code>/*</code> and
<code>*/</code>, and run the profile reset.</p>
<p>Once you’re done resetting your profile, you’ll need to change the
<code>devtools.chrome.enabled</code> preference to <code>true</code> again, and then re-open the
Scratchpad, paste the new code you saved back in to it, click on the
<code>Execute » Run</code> menu item, and <strong>shazam</strong>!  All your tabs should be back
(although they won’t be in their original tab groups.  If anyone needs me to
figure out how to do that, just let me know, and I’ll give it a try).</p>

<p>Here's a letter I wrote to Delphine's teacher about the daily reading log
he has asked us to have the children fill out — the children are supposed
to read for fifteen minutes a day, and the parents are expected to
initial the log on a daily basis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-top:10px;">
Mr. F——
</p>
<p style="padding-top:10px;">
Delphine has not been filling in her reading log. I admit I haven't been
encouraging her to -- I want her to read for as long as she wants to for
pleasure and knowledge, not to a clock because she's been told to. Delphine is
a born reader and we have no problem getting her to read or to challenge
herself.
</p>
<p style="padding-top:10px;">
I can assure you with a great deal of confidence that she has read for at least
fifteen minutes every day this September, and indeed probably every day since
she learned to read four years ago. I can also assure you, with almost the same
degree of confidence, that she will read for at least fifteen minutes a day for
the rest of the school year. I'm so confident of that that I would happily
pre-initial a year's worth of reading logs right now. However, I expect that
would defeat any other purposes of the reading log that you have in mind.
</p>
<p style="padding-top:10px;">
If the reading log serves to give you some idea of what students are reading,
would it be acceptable for Delphine to provide you a list of what she has read?
She's also willing to write a report on what she's read once a month or at some
other frequency if that would be helpful.
</p>
<p style="padding-top:10px;">
Let me know if you'd like to discuss this in person -- I'm available before and
after school most days.  
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully he will respond favourably. I think the only eventuality I didn't
cover in the above letter is that he wants the kids to fill in the reading log
because he wants them to get used to doing bullshit paperwork. This is a
defense which comes up frequently when this matter is under debate. "They're
going to have to do mindless busywork at some point, better get them used to
it!" I don't buy it. They're all going to have to, say, wear glasses at some
point (unless they die before middle age), but no-one advocates making all
children wear glasses. </p>
<p>And it's not like doing bullshit paperwork is a sophisticated skill you have
to start working on in childhood, like playing classical piano or doing
gymnastics. You can pretty much pick it up in half an hour.</p>
<p>Anyway, Mr. F—— strikes me as an intelligent and thoughtful 
teacher, so I don't think he's going to go for the bullshit paperwork angle.
We'll see how it turns out.</p>

    <div>
<p>I was looking at old posts and wow, I can't believe how much I used to post.
And how much I love reading old posts about the girls when they were littler,
and the things we used to do. I hate that I'm so busy I don't have time to
blog any more. </p>
<p>I need to get less busy. I don't know how. That's my leitmotif these days.</p>
<p>But I wasn't too busy to have lots of fun with the girls this summer. This
is what we did.</p>
<h5>High School Reunion</h5>
<p>The day after school ended we got on a plane to Saskatchewan. I have a
Simplenote to myself called <em>Summer Plans/Notes/Ideas</em> that includes the line,
"Don't leave the day after school ends", but this year I had to ignore my own
advice because my twentieth high school reunion was the weekend immediately
after the end of school, and Friday was the only sensible day to fly.</p>
<p>We rented a car (a Kia Soul, which drives exactly like the giant cardboard box
it resembles although it's very comfy and spacious on the inside, as long as
you're not transporting more than four cubic feet of stuff) and drove to Prince
Albert, where we stayed with my friend Debbie. </p>
<p>Debbie was my best friend in grade nine and maybe grade ten (it's kind of a
blur), and then I drifted into another group but we stayed on good terms. She's
now basically the only person I still talk to from high school. (Oh, and she's
also the person who introduced me to Guns n' Roses, with a cassette of
<em>Appetite for Destruction</em> which she might have copied from her
brother's copy.)</p>
<p>Debbie lives with her hot husband and her gorgeous kids in an adorable bungalow
in a suburb-y division of Prince Albert. (There isn't much of Prince Albert
that isn't suburb-y.) She has a lovely back yard with groomed lawn and tidy
garden beds, a variation on the same play structure we have, and a back gate
which opens on to a park with a playground. My kids get along with her kids
(they are still talking about them) and they spent hours playing in their
inflatable pool. Debbie and I still get along — good chemistry never
fades — so it was a terrific visit.  We'll definitely stay over at their
place again.</p>
<p>Debbie didn't actually come to the reunion — they went to a cottage
instead, but they let us use their house (and their babysitter!)</p>
<p>The reunion started with a tour of the high school. It was strange for me
because most of the tour was to parts of the school I hadn't actually spent
much time in: the pool, the gym, the art room, various technical shops and the
music room. I took almost all academic classes — the only technical class
I took was Electricity and Electronics, and the only arts class I took was
choir.  (I thought I recognized the music room from choir, but it turns out
they moved it since I was at school, so I recognized it wrong.)</p>
<p>The girls thought the school was pretty awesome, especially all the shops.
It's a comprehensive high school, so there is a wood shop, a welding shop,
a mechanic shop, a pottery studio, a cosmetology classroom, and on and on.
I kept on thinking, "I should have taken <em>this</em> in high school!", especially
in the drafting and CAD studio. I missed so many opportunities because I was
so fixed on a particular idea of myself and my future. </p>
<p>The next part of the reunion was a dinner and dance at the Prince Albert Golf
(and Curling?) Club. There was only a handful of people there — we were a
graduating class of three or four hundred, but apparently we mostly don't care
to see each other any more. But I got to hang out with some people I thought
were pretty cool in high school (still pretty cool) and some people I don't
remember, didn't recognize, but liked anyway.</p>
<p>One of the guys I chatted with was pretty awesome in school — he got
great grades and was a super athlete, on all the teams. Contrary to the athlete
stereotype, he wasn't good-looking or popular but he was well-liked.  But when
we got to the cafeteria part of the school tour he said that he had never eaten
in the cafeteria because he was afraid he wouldn't find anyone to sit with. We
were all so stupid and neurotic in high school. (Some of us still are.)</p>
<p>Anyway, the food was good and the company was good. The next morning Blake and
I and the girls enjoyed an incredibly comprehensive breakfast buffet
(omelettes! sausages! pancakes! chicken! lasagna! pie!) at the same venue with
a couple of reunion moms and their kids. (No other dads at that breakfast, not
sure why.) Sadly the other kids were all boys — Delphine and Cordelia
were quite unimpressed with their antics — but down at the grown-up end
of the table we had some great conversation. (I observed that conversations
about money in Prince Albert are exactly the same as conversations about money
in Toronto, except the numbers are half or a quarter the size. "I can't afford
$150 000 for a house!" "They're renting that place for $800!")</p>
<h5>Big River</h5>
<p>The rest of our stay in Saskatchewan was uneventful. My usual Big River fixer
— my mum's friend who takes us fishing and arranges trips to farms
— was sick, so we didn't have the usual adventures, but we did take lots
of walks through a lovely new waterfront trail.  (Big River is amping up their
tourist attractions because they haven't had any industry there since the
lumber mill shut down.)  We found an old tree fort, and the girls figured out
how to climb it. Debbie brought her kids up and we had lunch at the nice cafe.
I read lots of books and watched all my mother's police procedurals. The girls
were bored. We found a new beach and met some potential future playmates.</p>
<p>There was a bit of an adventure trying to work out how we would get back to
Saskatoon to catch our plane home. It's a three-hour drive, and usually my
mum's friend takes us. Since there is no public transport of any description up
there we had no plan B. Nothing. (Well, my mum knows an older guy with a
ponytail who lives in one of the trailers who she figured would probably take
us. So, no plan B.) What ended up happening is that my mother drove us an hour
south, and Debbie drove up from Prince Albert to pick us up, then all the way
down to Saskatoon to drop us off, and then back home to PA. Saint Debbie! Thank
goodness, and it was so much fun getting to visit with her on the way.</p>
<p>(Next time I'm renting a car and keeping it the whole visit.)</p>
<h5>Camp</h5>
<p>After we got home and caught up on Frappuccinos and playdates and family
visits, the girls had two weeks of day camp at Harbourfront. Delphine did
theater camp; they put on a short version of Disney's musical <em>Alice in
Wonderland</em>.  They also worked on vocal techniques, costumes, set design,
headshots, and other theatrey things; Delphine loved it, and she got to play
Alice. Well, she was one of four Alices. (She was the sweetest.)</p>
<p>Cordelia was in Canoe Camp for the first week. I like canoe camp because
they learn some basic canoe skills, and because they canoe over to the island
and get to explore some of the little bays and inlets. It seems like a 
very Toronto camp. For the second week Cordelia was in an unthemed
day camp (also at Harbourfront) and she enjoyed it, too. They went to
a park, and they went swimming (ironically they have to bus them to a
pool because you can't swim at Harbourfront) and to a beach.</p>
<p>While the girls were at camp I did some work and ran some errands; I went
to Ikea with my new neighbour Aimee, I got a dress fitted for Kat's wedding,
I looked after my friend Tanya's cats, I got a massage.</p>
<p>On July 30, Delphine and I went to the mall to get her a dress for Kat's
wedding while Cordelia spent the day with cousin Charlie for his birthday.
Delphine and I love clothes, so we had fun (especially since Sears has
formal dresses for $35). She tried on six dresses before picking her
favourite (which of course wasn't my favourite). We also hit H&amp;M for some
entirely gratuitous accessories: shiny gold shoes for Cordelia and a black
hat for Delphine.</p>
<h5>My Birthday</h5>
<p>On my birthday (I remember when my birthday used to get an entire post of its
own) Blake took the day off to hang out with us. I went and got my toenails
done in the morning while everyone baked me a cake, and then we went to the
Windsor Arms for afternoon tea. It was lovely even though we had to sit
outside. (Apparently you have to call weeks in advance to get a seating
inside.) Afternoon tea was delicious. The food came on a tiered plate stand, of
course. The bottom plate had big, fluffy scones with clotted cream and some
slightly dubious homemade jam. (The strawberry jam was greyish. Tasted fine,
though.) The middle plate had three kinds of sandwich, but I can't remember
what they were. And on top there was, I think, a little chocolate cake and a
little lemon tart and two other things. It was all tasty and we were
stuffed. (I always mean to bring the scones home and then I forget and
eat them first.)</p>
<p>After tea I made everyone walk down Bloor with me and window shop. We went
into Pottery Barn Kids, and looked at incredibly overpriced tea towels at
Williams-Sonoma. We went to The Body Shop and I got some much-needed makeup and
some not-really-needed-at-all lip glosses.</p>
<p>Blake and the girls baked me a birthday cake, and we had KFC for dinner.
In retrospect afternoon tea <em>and</em> KFC <em>and</em> birthday cake was probably 
overdoing it...</p>
<h5>Kat's Wedding</h5>
<p>Two days after my birthday was Kat's wedding, another event which 
deserves a blog post of its own. I've been friends with Kat for ten
years and seen her go through a procession of boyfriends and quasi-boyfriends
of varying levels of disappointingness. I was pleased when she finally
found someone kind and good and patient and interesting. (Though not as
pleased as she was, I'll wager.)</p>
<p>The wedding was fantastic, especially considering Kat just about whipped
the whole thing together in a month. The ceremony was a quick city hall
affair, well-attended by a large contingent of Kat's relatives and friends,
as well as a few of Joel's family from Saskatchewan. </p>
<p>The reception was at Currie Hall, a beautiful old room with high ceilings and
huge leaded windows. It's part of the National Ballet School and still has
brass barres on the walls. The food was delicious and plentiful, as were the
drinks and the speeches. My favourite part was Joel's trombone solo for Kat
(instead of a speech). Apart from the fact that I'm generally in favour of
music instead of speeches, it was a beautiful and touching performance.</p>
<p></p>
<center><hr width="40%"></center>
<p>The day after the wedding the girls went up to the cottage with Baba
and Zaida for a few days. Blake and I were invited, but it's hard to say
no to a few child-free days in the city. We had a nice time but spent
a lot of money on movies and eating out and buying books. (When you don't like
to be outside, there aren't a lot of free ways to have fun.)</p>
<h5>Centreville</h5>
<p>The day the girls got back from the cottage I took them down to Centreville.
(It was the only day that Ursa was going to be able to go; I thought maybe they
would be tired out from the cottage, but they were raring to go.) It was a
watershed year for them: Ursa was exactly "tall enough" and also "short enough"
to ride everything — she was the precise height which you have to be
shorter than to ride the little-kid rides (like the bee ride), and taller than
to ride the big-kid rides (like the bumper cars). So of course all the
attendants let her go on their ride — she got to ride everything! That was
very cool for Ursa and infuriating for Delphine because she's still too short
for the "tall enough" rides. (She's shorter than everyone, apparently.)</p>
<p>We hope that Delphine will grow enough to ride the bumper cars next year.</p>
<p>At Centreville we also met up with Kat and Joel and their ridiculously
adorable niece (and her mother). It was nice to hang out with Kat and Joel
before they disappeared back to SK to do more wedding stuff.</p>
<h5>Fort York and a Boat Ride</h5>
<p>One of our summer traditions is a take a boat ride down at the harbourfront.
Several different companies offer harbour tours on numerous boats, and this
year I decided to take the girls on the Kajama, a sailboat. </p>
<p>I also wanted to go to Fort York, a site I had never visited despite having
lived in Toronto for over fifteen years. Since Fort York is close to the
harbour I figured we could visit it in the morning, then walk down to the
harbour in time for our boat ride at 1:30.</p>
<p>Fort York is kind of hard to get to by transit — we took a bus down
Bathurst and then walked past a lot of condo construction and a large parking
lot to finally find the front gate. I was pleasantly surprised by how much
there was to see there; I figured it would be one of those rather dry
historical sites with a few restored bits and pieces and a bench or two, but
Fort York is staffed up the wazoo with tour guides and reenactors. There was a
small group of high school and university students in full (wool) uniform who
marched around playing fife and drum tunes and occasionally doing a specific
thing. While we were there they raised the flag and did a musket firing
demonstration.  We took a tour of the officers' quarters and ate piece of
period cake baked in the period kitchen by volunteers. (Apparently they're
putting together a cookbook — I look forward to that.)</p>
<p>I had only allotted an hour for Fort York, but we could have 
spent another hour there and gone on another of the many tours. It was
worth the trip.</p>
<p>Then we walked down to the harbour, unwittingly following in the footsteps
of <a href="http://www.westerncorridor1812.com/viewEvent.php?eventID=106">Isaac
Brock</a>. I don't think he stopped to play on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Waterfront_WaveDecks">undulating sidewalk</a> and have
an iced coffee, though. When we got to the ship it turned out that we were
half-an-hour early, due to my inability to read my own calendar, so we hung
around the harbourfront a bit and played on more undulating sidewalks. (A
baffled tourist: "What are they <em>for</em>?")</p>
<p>The Kajama was pretty nice. It's a beautiful ship, and also has a working
kitchen so you can have lunch (and beer!) on board. I was sufficiently
impressed by this that I decided we should eat lunch on the boat, but it 
detracted from the boat ride — we were so busy with our fries and chicken
fingers that we didn't pay attention to the lake and the scenery.</p>
<p>There wasn't a tour guide yakking on the Kajama the way there is on all the
other rides we've been on; I missed the chatter and the probably-apocryphal
stories about the Canada Malting plant and the Redpath sugar factory and the
Islands. I suppose it should have been a nice soothing ride but, I dunno, it
didn't work for me.</p>
<p>They raised the sails partway into the ride, and lowered them toward the
end, but it was a still day and I don't think they ever turned off the
motor. That was disappointing, too.</p>
<p>After the boat ride I think we just headed home. Union Station is under
construction in a <a href="http://urbantoronto.ca/sites/default/files/imagecache/display-default/images/articles/2011/06/1229/urbantoronto-1229-3670.jpg">big
way</a>, and they're also doing track work or something along Front Street so
there's no streetcar from Union to Queen Quay and the Exhibition. Worse, the
bus that's running in place of the streetcar drops you off in some weird spot
halfway to King Station (except not, because then you could just walk to King)
so you have to double back and cross Front and Bay at an intersection that's a
mess of temporary barriers and pylons and confusion. We had to do that several
times this summer and every time I thought one of my children would get run
over for sure.</p>
<h5>Distillery District</h5>
<p>The day after the boat ride I had to meet with Greg Wilson about something.  I
thought it would be cool to meet with him at the new <a href="http://www.waterfrontoronto.ca/explore_projects2/west_don_lands/underpass_park">Underpass
park</a>. The park is in Greg's neighbourhood, it looks cool and it's got an
undercover place for the girls to play. It had just opened to much media
fanfare; I thought it would be awesome.</p>
<p>Then we couldn't find it. The website says it is between this street and that
street, south of here or there — we went there and all we could find was
a lot of construction. (We saw lots and lots of construction of various kinds
this summer.) We wandered and wandered and finally gave up and decided to meet
Greg at the Distillery District. (Apparently Kat knows how to find it, but we never did get a chance to go. Next summer...)</p>
<p>The Distillery District was fine and the girls seemed to enjoy it (I don't know
why, it's not much fun for kids). We had some excessively sophisticated
ice cream from Soma (should have gone to Greg's — Greg's Ice Cream, not
Greg Wilson's) and then we got caught in the rain. There is no bus route that
goes to the Distillery District (transit in this city is <em>so stupid</em>
sometimes!) so we got wetter and wetter as we hunted for a functional bus or
streetcar route. </p>
<p>We finally got on the King car, and then I dragged the girls down to <a href="http://www.raindropsto.com/location/">Raindrops</a> under the Royal York
to get a proper umbrella. I've been meaning to buy a good umbrella, one that
will last, for a while now and this seemed like a good opportunity. I was
pleasantly surprised at the prices: I walked in ready to pay $125 for an
umbrella and found the good ones were available for $60 or $70. So I bought the
girls each a <a href="http://www.raindropsto.com/umbrellas/bubble-umbrellas/fulton-birdcage-bubble-umbrella">birdcage
umbrella</a> as well.</p>
<p>(Of course after I spent $100 on umbrellas the rain stopped and didn't return
for two weeks. You're welcome.)</p>
<h5>The Ex</h5>
<p>The Ex is the Canadian National Exhibition, Toronto's pompously named summer
fair. It's mostly a giant midway, with a token gesture towards agriculture and
crafts. I went when Delphine was fifteen months old and I could carry her
in the BabyTrekker, and it sucked; it was hot and crowded and boring. I've
avoided it ever since, instead taking the kids to the Royal Agricultural Winter
Fair, which is about the same but without the midway, with way more
agriculture, and in winter so it's not ridiculously hot.</p>
<p>But now Delphine is nine and Cordelia is six and they're not such a pain in the
ass to take out places. They also talk to other six- and nine-year-olds and
apparently <em>everyone</em> goes to The Ex. (However, apparently also <em>everyone</em> goes
to Disney World and Montreal.) So I thought I would brave it one more time and
see how it went.</p>
<p>We had Kat to guide us this time; she spends at lot of time at the Ex because
her band marches in the "Mardi Gras Parade" that runs every day at 5:00. She
gets free admission every day, so she is able to wander the grounds without the
pressure of seeing everything in one visit. She pointed us in the direction of
the kids' midway and the appalling food, which is really what I was there for. </p>
<p>It was actually okay. The kids' midway had lots of neat rides which were
different from the rides at Centreville, but was still small enough to 
not overwhelm. We were there on a Wednesday towards the beginning
of the fair (it goes on for <em>weeks</em>) and so it wasn't crowded at all. </p>
<p>Cordelia and Delphine ate a slushy and an entire funnel cake each, and I had a
deep fried Jo Louis and bubble tea. It was excessive — I think we didn't
eat dinner.</p>
<h5>The Beach</h5>
<p>Another adventure later that same week was a trip to the beach. Toronto boasts
several beautiful, clean beaches and I like to have at least one day at the
beach every summer. This time we went to Ashbridge's Bay. Once again we met up
with Kat (it's great having a friend who's a teacher) and once again she acted
as tour guide — she grew up in the Beaches. We spent some time on the
beach and then dragged the reluctant children along the boardwalk to look at
real estate. Then we doubled back along Queen Street where I bought straw hats
for myself and the girls ($7 each!), got ice cream from Ed's Real Scoop (coffee
toffee!) and visited the library.</p>
<p>Next year I'll plan to spend longer at the beach. The girls could basically
spend the entire day on the beach, so I'll pack lots of reading matter and 
a large hat.</p>
<p>I think next year I might also separate the "Beaches neighbourhood" adventure
from the "beach" adventure. There's a ravine called Glen Stewart just north of
the Beaches which according to <a href="http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=188119">Adam
Giambrone</a> is pretty spectacular. So we can start at the north end of that,
walk through, and then finish with ice cream and window shopping on Queen. And
go to another beach another day.</p>
<h5>ROM</h5>
<p>Blake took a week off at the end of summer to get a taste of our fun.  He
wanted to see the <a href="http://www.rom.on.ca/dinos/index.php">dinosaur
exhibit</a> at the ROM, so we did that on his first day off. The exhibit was
spectacular, and we had a nice time reacquainting ourselves with favourites in
the museum. (We haven't had a membership for a while.) There's an indoor
beehive in the children's section which has a little tunnel out a window so the
bees can go in and out — the bees had also built themselves an outdoor
hive on the window! And we spun the "what animal are you" wheel and everyone
got "insect".</p>
<h5>Painting</h5>
<p>The other exciting thing we did while Blake was off was paint the house.  When
we moved in I picked out this tasteful putty colour for the walls, thinking it
would be sophisticated and interesting. It turned out to be cruddy and
depressing; it just looked like decades of nicotine stains.  I gave it five
years to stop sucking and it never did, so we painted over it with Benjamin
Moore's Cloud White. (Yes, white! The problem with the putty colour is that it
never looked like <em>a colour</em>, just like a dingy, dimly-lit white.  Now the
walls are actually white and I'm much happier. And our art looks excellent.)</p>
<h5>That's Not All</h5>
<p>We did lots of other things this summer: we went to the Tuesday farmers' market
at Davisville Park, we met up with friends at Oriole Park, we shopped for
ballet clothes, we had playdates (okay, mostly the girls had playdates), we
went to the Science Centre, we decluttered the porch and tidied the girls'
rooms, Cordelia learned how to ride a bike.</p>
<p>It's almost outrageous how much fun I have in summer. I love planning our
adventures, hanging out with the girls, seeing new parts of the city, and the
long idle days of exploring and watching them play. </p>
<p>Sometime in the middle of August I started to get anxious because I hadn't done
as much work as I had hoped to in summer. Then I realized that in five years
Delphine will be fourteen; she will be hanging out with friends or working or
doing camps. She definitely won't want to spend the summer going to the beach
and the island and the park with me. And when I look back at these last few
years I won't wish I had spent more of my summers working. I have half a
lifetime to work after my children are grown, but these long summer days are
fleeting. I will enjoy every minute of them.</p>

    <div>
<p>A friend of mine recently asked what I do about dinner, since I somehow manage
to work (during school months, at least) and do lots of volunteer crap and also
feed my family reasonably well. She wanted some meal ideas.</p>
<p>There's no real trick to cooking half-decent (quarter-decent on bad days)
meals, just a series of habits which I've developed over the years.</p>
<h5>Meal Plan</h5>
<p>Once a week I make a meal plan. "Meal plan" is actually too grandiose; I write
down five dinner ideas. I don't like to spend more than an hour preparing
dinner (apparently <a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/Working-Families-Rely-Heavily-on-8083.aspx?RelNum=8083">pretty typical</a>)
which limits the weekday dinner repertoire, but we still have a pretty good
list to choose from.</p>
<p>After we (I usually solicit ideas and opinions from the rest of the family)
pick the five dinner ideas I make a shopping list based on those meals.
We typically do one big shop on the weekend and then an auxilliary shop
mid-week for milk and other perishables.</p>
<p>With the meal list in hand I also decide which dinner we're having which day,
based on what ingredients will spoil first, which days are rushed, when we're
having company, etc.  Knowing what meal I'm preparing each day also tells me
when I'm making something which requires prep earlier in the day, like a crock
pot meal or roast. </p>
<h5>Other Meal Habits</h5>
<p>Most days we eat at 6:00, which means I try to be home and cooking at 5:00. 
(It usually doesn't actually take an hour of work to make dinner, but I started
giving myself an hour when the kids were small to allow for interruptions,
and now I just like to have the time if I need it.) Knowing we eat at 6:00
and I cook at 5:00 helps me make decisions about playdates and activities;
i.e., we don't schedule them for those times if possible. (As the girls get
older and their activities are more "serious" I find it's harder to control
what time they're at, but I try.)</p>
<p>If I know I won't be able to be in the kitchen at 5:00, I plan a crock-pot
or other make-ahead meal and "borrow" that hour from earlier in the day.</p>
<h5>Some Meal Ideas</h5>
<p>Here are seven of our favourite meals, with ingredients and instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Bean Burritos</strong>: tortillas, can of black or red beans, lettuce,
tomatoes, cheese, salsa, sour cream, rice.</p>
<p>Drain the beans and put them in a pot with some water (enough to barely come to
the top of the beans) and a generous pinch of garlic powder. Throw in a
teaspoon of chicken boullion powder. Let it all simmer for twenty minutes or
more, mashing the beans occasionally. Serve in a nice bowl.</p>
<p>(Optional classy version: use chopped fresh garlic, and chicken broth instead
of water and boullion.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile cook the rice, chop up the lettuce and tomatoes, and grate some
cheese. Warm the tortillas on a plate in the oven or wrapped in a clean tea
towel in the microwave. Get a kid to set the table, put out all the food and
let everyone assemble their own burritos. </p>
<p><strong>Chicken and Salsa</strong>: skinless chicken parts (thighs are nice),
salsa, rice, salad or crudites.</p>
<p>Either throw the chicken and the salsa in the crockpot around 2:00 and cook on
high for the rest of the afternoon, or throw them in a dutch oven-type pot at
5:00 and cook at 350°F for about 45 minutes with the lid on. Serve over rice. </p>
<p>Serve with salad or crudites. (Bagged salad is just fine.)</p>
<p><strong>Big Salad</strong>: lettuce, baby tomatoes, cheese, deli meat, eggs,
cucumber, green onion, baguette.</p>
<p>Boil the eggs. Cut up the lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber and green onion. Grate
the cheese, slice the deli meat into little strips. Once the eggs have cooled,
quarter them.</p>
<p>Either put the lettuce in a bowl and arrange everything on top, or serve
everything separately in little bowls and let everyone assemble their own
(perfect for picky eaters, but make sure everyone eats something from all the
food groups). Serve with a good dressing, like Renee's (or homemade dressing),
and chunks of baguette and butter.</p>
<p><strong>Macaroni and Cheese</strong>: macaroni, milk, butter, flour, sharp cheddar cheese (we buy the cheap stuff you can get in great big slabs).</p>
<p>Cook macaroni. </p>
<p>While it's cooking melt about two tablespoons of butter in your favourite sauce
pan. Add about the same amount of flour and whisk them together. Cook over
medium heat until it smells like shortbread. Add a little bit of milk and whisk
together — don't panic as it turns into a lumpy mess. Add a bit more
milk, whisk together, warm gently until it gets all lumpy again. Repeat until
you've added about two cups of milk. (I don't know if you really have to mess
about with all the adding and mixing, but it's kind of fun.) Heat until hot,
then remove from heat and add a little salt and pepper and whisk in some
mustard powder. Stir in two or more cups of grated cheese.</p>
<p>When the macaroni is cooked, add the cheese sauce and serve. Alternately 
you can drain the macaroni when it's not quite done, put it in a casserole with
the cheese sauce, sprinkle some bread crumbs and grated cheese on top and 
heat it in a 350°F oven for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Traditionally we serve this with sliced apple, but go ahead and add your
favourite side-vegetable.</p>
<p><strong>Tuna Pasta Salad</strong>: short pasta, tuna (2 cans), tomatoes, green 
onion, mayo or italian dressing.</p>
<p>Cook the pasta. While it's cooking, cut up the tomatoes and green onion. Drain
the tuna. Once the pasta is done and drained, mix everything together. Serve
warm or chilled.</p>
<p><strong>Spaghetti and meatballs</strong>: spaghetti, tomato puree, garlic,
onions, homemade or frozen meatballs, salad or crudites.</p>
<p>Here's one that you can spend as much time as you like on, because you can buy
the pasta sauce and the meatballs and just throw it all together, or you 
can hand-make one or both of the sauce and the meatballs.</p>
<p>Here's how to make sauce: chop up the onions and garlic and saute them
gently in olive oil — not too high heat or you'll burn the garlic, and
there's no recovering from that. Add the tomato puree — either one of
those bottles of Italian strained tomato or a can of pureed tomato — and
let it simmer gently for at least twenty minutes, or longer if you have time.
(Keep an eye on it so it doesn't burn.) If you're using frozen meatballs, you
can add them to the sauce after it's been simmering a while to cook them
— follow the instructions!</p>
<p>You can also make meatballs yourself. I like to make square meatballs, which is
just meatloaf cooked in a lasagna dish (so it's really shallow and flat) and
cut into little squares.</p>
<p><strong>"Moroccan" beef and cous cous</strong>: stewing beef, onions, garlic, a
dozen dried apricots, cinnamon, cumin, cayenne, canned diced tomatoes, cous
cous, plain yogurt.</p>
<p>Chop up and brown the onions in your favourite cooking fat; add to crock pot or
dutch oven. Brown the beef, add them to the onions. Halve the apricots and add
them to the pot along with the garlic, apricots, cinnamon (1 tsp), cumin (1
tsp), cayenne (1/2 tsp), and tomatoes, and some black pepper. (There's probably
enough salt in the tomatoes but add some more if you like.)</p>
<p>Cook in the crock pot all day on low (check it mid-afternoon -- if it's really
done-looking turn to "keep warm") or in the dutch oven at 350 for... I guess an
hour, hour and a half? (I don't think I've ever made it in the oven.)</p>
<p>Serve over cous cous with yogurt on the side, and your favourite side veg.</p>
<p>(I call it "Moroccan" because it seems Moroccan to me but I actually have no
idea if this is the kind of thing they eat in Morocco. Probably not.)</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>So that's how I bastardize the cuisines of the world; I expect this post
will drive away any snobs who might read this blog. I hope these ideas are
useful for the rest of you! While you're here, why don't you add your favourite
quick dinner to the comments below?</p>

<p>As I get older I expect less from my birthdays. As
a child I was doted on and showered with presents, all of which I loved.
(I think kids love presents more because they can't buy anything for
themselves, so any material things seem wonderful.) Now that I'm older and
more averse to stuff, particularly not the very specific stuff I want —
in a 1200 square foot house there's no room for things that are lovely
but not quite right — getting stuff is not as thrilling as it
was.</p>
<p>But I still like that feeling of being special and adored, and fortunately
my family is good at providing that. Yesterday was my thirty-seventh birthday,
and we all took the day off to enjoy it.</p>
<p>After breakfast the girls and I walked to the grocery store for
a newspaper and a bouquet of flowers. (I don't know why I don't 
buy myself flowers more often — they were only $10.) Then I took my paper
and went off for a pedicure in preparation for Kat's wedding, while
Blake and the girls baked me a cake.</p>
<p>Cake baked and nails painted, we fancied ourselves up for 
an early afternoon tea. Delphine is still good at putting together
outfits; she wore a black twill skirt with rickrack trim, and a tropical
print top with ruched bodice and puffed sleeves. She topped-and-bottomed it
with silver ballerina flats and her new black trilby with sparkly
trim.</p>
<p>The rest of us looked pretty good too.</p>
<p>Tea was at the Windsor Arms. (We've tried the teas at the King Edward 
and the Royal York.) Apparently if you want to get seats inside you have to
call weeks in advance. I called last Friday, so we sat outside; if you know
Blake, you know what a sacrifice that is. I had to make sure, when I called, 
that there would be shade and that they haven't been having trouble with wasps.
They seated us at a fairly shady table; I took the sunniest spot, and the
sun soon moved behind a tree. (We had one black-and-yellow visitor, but we all
remained studiously calm and he soon moved on.)</p>
<p>Tea was delicious. We started with a tiny goat cheese quiche, then pillowy
white scones with clotted cream and jam. The middle plate was a selection
of tiny sandwiches, rolled sushi-style: smoked salmon, chicken, and cream
cheese with sundried tomato. Finally, four miniature desserts, and just when we
thought we couldn't stuff in another bite, the waiter brought round little
pots of strawberries and cream.</p>
<p>If I could offer advice on not overstuffing oneself, I would say eat only one
scone, or maybe even half a scone — they're huge and filling, and also
very easy to take home. I was too full to really enjoy the desserts.
(Or I suppose you could eat the desserts first.)</p>
<p>The girls had mango and apple tea, iced; I had darjeeling and Blake had
oolong. All delicious.</p>
<p>After tea we walked up to Bloor and window-shopped in Pottery Barn and
Williams-Sonoma.  I thought about getting some new tea towels at
Williams-Sonoma, but I can't spend $38 on a pair of tea towels. I also had a
good laugh at their "found" pottery table; crap from garage sales comically
marked up.  There was a four-ounce dish with some old brand name on it for $78,
and a nondescript brown half-glazed pot for $237.</p>
<p>Then we went to the Body Shop and I took advantage of the birthday goodwill to 
get some new makeup: powder since I have gone all greasy lately (the weather?
some kind of hormonal change?) and bronzing powder to fill in the gaps in my
tan for Kat's wedding. (Their #01 bronzing powder is uncannily identical to
my tanned colour.) I also got some lip glosses, because you can't have too many
lip glosses.</p>
<p>Then Delphine had a little meltdown because it's not fair that I get to get
all this stuff I want and she can't get anything because she doesn't have any
money because we haven't given her allowance for <em>ages</em>. She's right about the
last part — all of us, kids included, are very lackadaisical about their
weekly allowance, and we probably owe them about $20 each at this point. So I
gave her a tenner and promised that we'd come up with a system to make sure
they get paid every week from now on. </p>
<p>After we had had a little rest in the coolth of the Manulife Centre we 
walked up to the Reference Library, which the kids haven't been into before
and I haven't been into since they built the new entrance. We went all
the way to the top and admired the view, then walked down the stairs. Delphine
and I planned to come back when she's older: she will study and I will work.</p>
<p>Then home, where I spent some time on the couch while Blake cleaned the kitchen
(oh bliss). At 7:00 we finally decided to get my traditional birthday KFC,
although Blake and I weren't really hungry. (In retrospect, high tea and
KFC in the same day was excessive.) After the dirty chicken we had a thin
slice of birthday cake each and then all went to bed.</p>
<hr width="40%">
<p>I don't have any profound thoughts on being thirty-seven, except that I don't
have that usual sense of panic about how I'm getting old and I haven't done
anything interesting with my life, I'm a failure aaaaah. It's nice. I like my
job, I like my kids, I like my husband and the rest of my family, and my
friends. I don't really like my house much, but I don't hate it and it's
certainly more and better house than I have any right to expect, considering
the global average. So I'm grateful for that, when I remember to be. </p>
<p>Thirty-seven seems kind of old; I've joked about being old on past birthdays,
but this year I'm not really joking. (I will look back and laugh when I turn
fifty-seven or seventy-seven, inshallah.) Thirty-seven is not an age for moping
about your life, for complaining that things aren't working out or that the
world is unfair; it's an age for getting on with it, for figuring things out
and doing them. It's a grown-up age.</p>
