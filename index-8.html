<p>I thought I’ld take a few minutes to talk about just what it is that’s
allowing me to write an entry while I’m walking down the street on my way
to the gym.  (And on my way home from the gym, and on the subway to work
the next day, because while I’m connected, I’m not necessarily fast at
either Graffiti or writing weblog entries.)</p>
<p>As I’m sure you know, I’m a computer programmer by trade, and so when I run
into a problem, I tend to want to write a program to fix it for me.  A long
time ago I got a PalmPilot Professional, partially so that I could keep
track of my projects and assignments, and partially because I could write
programs for it in C.  Then, someone wrote a C compiler that ran on the
Palm.  I was so excited that I could finally write code on the subway!
Until the first program I wrote crashed my Palm.  I quickly realized that C
was just too hard a language for writing Palm programs.  (It’s not so bad
if you’re working on a desktop, and have an IDE, and an emulator to test
on, but for on-Palm development, it really sucks.)  I also played around
with an implementation of Forth for the Palm, but I couldn’t get enough of
a library of utility words built up to do anything useful with it.  Later,
I learned a language called Python, which was far easier to write programs
in, both due to being an easier language syntactically, and due to the
wealth of useful libraries it comes with.  After a while, someone ported
Python to the Palm, and so I played around with that, but I found it, too,
was lacking the libraries I needed for it to be useful to me.  Finally,
someone posted on the Python tutor list about a program called Plua, which
was an implementation of Lua for the Palm.  There are a lot of things I
don’t like about Lua the language, but when creating a screen for a Palm
app is as simple as:</p>

<p>I’ll put up with a lot of ugliness in the language.</p>
<p>Of course, I made it sound like a much smoother progression than it
actually was.  I took side trips into Basic, Smalltalk, Perl, Scheme, Java,
Intercal, Visual Basic, and Ruby, but none of those were serious contenders
for on-Palm programming, and Java is the only one I still use these days.
But I remember enough of them to be the person to ask when someone at the
office needs to debug a program written in one of them.</p>
<p>Where was I?  Oh, yeah, Plua.  Plua makes it really easy for me to create
programs for my Palm, and so makes it far more likely that I’ll actually
complete whatever random project it is that requires a Palm program to be
written.  In this case, it was a way for me to write weblog entries in the
standard Palm MemoPad application (or, more accurately, in pEdit, a
replacement which handles memos of up to 32kb, as opposed to Palm’s 4kb
size restriction).  Since I was leveraging the standard MemoPad, my
application was turning out to be much simpler than a full-fledged
weblogging application, but it was still taking me a long time to write it
in C++, partially because I needed (or more accurately wanted) to write a
generic framework for use in other applications I might write, and
partially because I don’t have a lot of spare time for programming.
Switching to Plua let me write the application in a day or two, and I can
easily change things around in it, or add features, without going through
the hassle of a compliation and hotsync.</p>
<p>The hardest piece to get working was the conduit.  Since my Palm doesn’t
have a WiFi connection, it’s a bit of a pain to use programs which depend
on network connections.  Conduits, on the other hand, get run every time I
hotsync, which is usually once or twice per day.  I had been planning on
writing the conduit in C++, which was going to be quite a pain for me,
since I  didn’t know of any libraries that could handle ftp over secure
sockets.  Fortunately, Rick Price asked me whether it would be possible to
write a conduit in Python.  "Sure", I said, and then started thinking about
how you would do it.  You could either wrap the C API up into a Python
library, which would take a lot of work, or you could use Python’s COM
support to talk to the COM API.  I figured that would probably be an easier
way to go, and since I had some free time, I started experimenting.  It
turns out that it was a little harder than I had anticipated, but it still
wasn’t too bad, and I think I’ve finished the worst of it.  The Secure-FTP
library was easy to find, and after some firewall config on my home machine
works quite well.</p>

    <p>I'm hoping to get a plugin written for the area over on the right there
which will display some statistics about my last few bike rides.  Ever
since I got my new bike computer (the Cateye Astrale 8), I've been keeping
track of all the data it produces, which is to say trip time, trip
distance, average speed for the trip, maximum speed for the trip, and the
total distance odometer.  I haven't tried to graph any of it yet, but I'm
sure that'll come soon enough.  In the meantime, it looks like I'm getting
faster on average (from 19.2 km/h (12 mph) on my first trip to 21.2 km/h
(13 mph) on my most recent trip).  It's around 17.16 km (10 .66 miles) to
my office and back, and I've gone 175 km (108.75 miles) so far.  Of course,
I've actually gone farther than that, since I biked to work before I got
the computer, but I'm happy to ignore those trips for the purposes of
tracking my distance.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any guesses as to what the stats will be by the time it
gets too cold for me to bike anymore?  Personally, I don't think that I'll
get too much faster, either on my max speed, or on average.  My trip
distance will probably increase by a little bit, since I've found some neat
paths that are just a little out of my way, and I think I'ld like to take
them.  And I'm hoping to more than double my total distance, which should
be a no-brainer, since after two more weeks (or 10 trips to and from the
office), I'll have doubled it, but I'm not sure if the weather will hold
out that long.  It's been mightily chilly up here for the past few days.
It was only 4°Celsius (39.2°F) when I rode to work this morning, and I
could really feel the bite of the wind, even through my tiny cotton gloves.
If it keeps up like that, I might have to buy a real pair of biking gloves,
or stop biking for a while.  Though I've got to admit, it was a nice
feeling to not be all sweaty when I got to the office.</p>

    <p>I've started writing an installer for my PalmBlosxom conduit, and
associated files.  It's been both easier and harder than I had thought.  It
was way easier to get the installer portion written so far, and I don't see
any particular difficulties cropping up in that part of it.  Sure, there
are still a bunch of things to do, like installing the Palm program for
users who aren't named "bwinton", and learning the strange variant of
Pascal that the installer uses to script things so that I can accomplish
the previous task, but by and large that portion of it is done.  The
uninstall portion of this grand experiment, on the other hand, has been a
royal pain in the ass.  It was fairly easy when all I did was copy some
<img src="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/weblog/InnoSetup.png" align="right"> files somewhere and I was done, but when I switched to
registering the conduit with the HotSync application (so that it would run,
instead of just sitting there), I started getting errors, and nothing I've
attempted so far can get rid of them.  I guess I can sort of understand why
it thinks it can't delete the file, but I swear to you, I've unregistered
the dll it thinks it can't delete about four different ways, and
furthermore, as soon as the uninstaller exits I can delete the files either
from the command line, or from the Windows Explorer, without any problem.
Heck, I can even run the installer again, and it will overwrite them
without complaining.  I just can't figure out how to do it
programmatically.  How annoying.</p>

<p>So,if anyone out there has any experience with InnoSetup, and/or
uninstalling Palm Conduits, I'ld appreciate it if you could <a href="mailto:bwinton%2Bblog@latte.ca">drop me a line</a>, and I'll explain
in more detail what I'm trying to do, and how it's failing, or you could <a href="http://www.latte.ca/svn/PalmBlosxom/setup.py">check out the source to
my setup program</a> (which generates the .iss file for InnoSetup), and
hopefully point out my misunderstanding from it.</p>

<p><img src="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/weblog/NSIS.png" align="right"><b>Update:</b> I think I'm going to switch to NSIS.  I tried
the innosetup newsgroups, but they weren't as helpful as I would have
hoped.  I'll continue to read them, in the hopes that someone will answer
my question, but I think that I'm not going to get an answer, or at least
not one that I like, so NSIS it is.</p>

    <p>I got a new computer at work on Monday, and so eagerly switched
over all my data to it.  But I didn't install all the various programs
that were on the old machine.  Partly because I had a ton of stuff
installed, and my registry was a complete mess, and partly because I
wasn't working on a lot of the tasks I used to work on, and so didn't
need the tools installed anymore.  But one of the results of this is
that my oh-so-clever palm-memo-to-weblog-entry conduit isn't
installed, and indeed, the components it relies on also aren't
installed, so while I have a perfect chance to write and test an
installer, I haven't even started that yet, so all the weblog posts
I'm writing there are likely going to be delayed by a few days or even
up to a week.</p>

<p>Boy was I ever right there.  It's taken almost three weeks to get
that entry posted.  But now my conduit has an installer, and is
packaged up into a dll, and registers itself and everything, so I
should be able to send it off to other people with just a little more
code in the installer.  I'm kind of pumped.  And apparently other
people are interested in doing something similar, so my little bit of
code might get released in a couple of other places too.  But for now,
you can find the conduit, and the setup script which builds the dll
and the installer <a href="http://www.latte.ca/svn/PalmBlosxom/">here</a>.  (The code is in
the conduit directory, and the setup.py script is in the root.)</p>

<p>For a while now, I've been meaning to bike to work.  It's
healthier, less crowded, more relaxing, and costs less than taking the TTC.
Okay, so the two middle reasons are kind of made up, but the first one has been
getting more and more compelling, and just recently the last one has taken on a
new urgency.  I calculated that I was spending $19 per week travelling to and
from work, and since we had to scrimp on our last grocery trip, having an extra
$20 in the fund would have made a fairly large difference.  So I started biking
to work.  It was fairly easy on the way there, but much harder on the way back,
and it wasn't made any easier by my working out just before the ride home, nor
by the fact that it's mostly uphill.  The next couple of times I tried it,
however, it was much easier, probably because I'm getting more used to it.  So,
without further ado, here's the path I take to and mostly from work, with some
annotations.</p>

<p>
<b>1.</b>  This is by far the easiest way for me to get started.  It isn't
marked on the map, but there's a series of laneways there that take me
right to the start of the Belt Line, an abandoned railway track that was
turned into a bike/jogging/walking path quite a while ago.<br><b>2.</b>  Zoom!  This big curvy section is all downhill, and there is a
total of one stop sign on it.  There is also a lot of traffic, and some
speed bumps, so on my way to work I get to zip by a billion cars, and feel
extra fast.  Of course, with every good comes a bad, and on the way back I
nearly die trying to get up the same hill.  (I take the path just to the
right on the return trip.)  The first time I rode up it, I stopped halfway
up.  The next time, I geared down to 1-3 (where the first number means the
easiest gear of three on my front wheel, and the second number means the
third easist gear of seven on my back wheel).  The next time, I only geared
down to 2-1.  And the last time, I was still at 3-4 when I hit the top of
the hill.  I spend most of my time on flat roads switching between 3-5,
3-6, and 3-7, so my eventual goal is to stay in that range on large hills.
At which point I'll probably look into changing the ratios of my gears, so
that I can get more speed on the flat and downhill portions of my
trip.<br><b>3.</b>  For something on a signed bike lane, this is a remarkably hard
street to cross, since I have to jog over half a block to get to the new
bike lane.  The right turn at the light isn't so bad, but the left turn
from the major road onto the side street can really suck rocks if traffic
is moving.  I hope they improve it, but I can't really see a good way for
them to, since that's just the way the road goes.  It's also a pain coming
the other way, involving a left turn at a light onto a major street.<br><b>4.</b>  I always miss this on the way back, leading to discussion #3
again.  (I actually did a little more hunting around, and I found out where
that bike lane actually starts, and ends up, and I think I might take that
route more often now.) <br><b>5.</b>  There's a light at John and Queen, but not at Beverly and Queen,
so I always cut over a block here, because crossing major streets is a lot
easier when the traffic stops for you.<br><b>6.</b>  I actually lock my bike up about ½ a block north of the door
into my office, partially because it's right outside the back door to my
office (which is exit only), and partially because it's less likely to be
used by the bike couriers who are also tenants of this building.<br></p>

<p>And that's my transportation.  I've skipped a couple of days for various
reasons so far, and I expect I'll continue to skip some days, but I am
getting a lot more exercise than I used to, which can't be bad.  I'm really
pretty excited about it, which you could probably have guessed by my
creating an entire new category just for this post.  Surely I wouldn't do
that if there was only going to be one post here, would I?  On the down
side, I now want a lot of new toys for my bike, like a bike computer to
tell me how far and how fast I've gone, and clipless pedals, and maybe a
more comfortable seat.<br clear="all"></p>

In the past, as you have been unfortunate enough to witness, 
I have been miserable about my life, feeling like it's not going
anywhere or I'm not doing good enough or I'm not achieving anything or
whatever.  Recently, however, that feeling has subsided.  I'm feeling
mellow, like whatever needs doing will get done, and I'll be able to
deal with stuff as it comes up, and I'm not a big loser.  It's
refreshing!
</p>
<p>
To what do I attribute this change?  If only I knew.  But I'm working on
a theory that it has something to do with all the 
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/~arbrown/reading.html">books</a> 
I've been reading lately,
really good books about normal people living their normal lives.  Like
<em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</em> and 
<em>Captain Corelli's Mandolin</em> and <em>Clare Callan</em>
and <em>The Brothers K</em>.  I don't have a lot more to this theory,
other than that maybe reading all these books has made me pull my 
head out
of my own ass and think about other people instead of just sitting around
worrying about my own "problems".  
</p>
<p>
I also haven't read any parenting advice books lately, I bet that helps.
There's nothing that makes you think your life is so significant than
reading a book all about what's wrong with it and what you have to do to
make it better.
</p>
<hr width="30%">
<p>
By the way, the reason for all these books is that I finally got off my
ass (actually got <em>on</em> my ass) and figured out how to use the 
Toronto Public Library inter-library loan system on the Internet.  Now
I barely have to do more than think "Huh, I'd like to read that book", and
I get a call from a nice recorded lady telling me that the book is 
waiting for me at my local branch.  It's amazing, except that
<em>About a Boy</em>, <em>Due Preparations
for the Plague</em>, <em>The Diary of Samuel Pepys</em>, <em>A Fine
Balance</em>, and <em>Quicksilver</em> <strong>all</strong> arrived
at the same time, just after I had taken out <em>The Brothers K</em>.
That's almost 3500 pages of book.  Good thing I also know how to renew over
the Internet.

I think I can officially declare that Delphine's first word is
"up!"  Spoken imperiously while tugging on pant legs or holding up
a book to be read.  She also says "Hi" and "Byebye" (actually
"Buh-bye") but it's hard to tell whether she knows what they mean.
"Buh-bye" is always accompanied by waving.  She also makes a 
credible attempt at "Zeyde": "Tz-da", but she definitely doesn't know
what (who) it means.
</p>
<p>
In other news, she's sleeping pretty well in the crib.  She wails a few
little wails when we put her down, and then drops off to sleep and 
stays there until about 5:00 am or 6:00 am.  Then we bring her into
bed and I desperately try and catch another hour of sleep while she 
has breakfast.  I would like her to not cry when we put her down, and
I would like her to not wake up so early, but I do not know how to 
go about effecting either of those things.  I suppose I could go back
to the advice books I scorned so thoroughly earlier, but I don't think
I'm ready for that yet.
</p>
<p>
She's eating pretty well, although I'm breaking a couple of rules
in order to get her to eat: I don't sit her down in her high chair
and feed her.  Instead, we hang out in the living room
and I give her bites of whatever she's having while she toddles around
and plays and hangs out.  She seems to eat more that way.  I only do
that for one meal a day, though, and for the other two I make her sit
properly.  It's not bedlam here, you know.  
</p>
<p>
The other rule I break is that I let her wander around with her sippy 
cup of milk, which is supposed to be bad for their teeth or make them 
obese or something.  In general I'm not doing a great job looking after
her teeth.  She won't let me brush them, and I don't know what the hell
to do.  Every few days I poke at them ineffectually with her pink and
yellow baby toothbrush while she clenches her jaw.  Maybe one day she'll 
actually let me in 
there.  Anyway, I'm sure my parents never brushed my teeth as a baby,
and I turned out fine!  (A sound and popular argument among proponents
of many a lousy parenting technique.)
</p>
<p>
My friend Tanya from pre-natal class and I are both poking idly at
the idea of doing something productive with our lives; me working
for my father-in-law to earn money to buy a dishwasher, she making
a documentary about her husband's family's pursuit of Native status,
or something.  Clearly she is far cooler than me.  Anyway, to that end
we need someone else to take care of our babies while we do our shit.
We bandied about a few ideas, and finally settled on each other!  We're
going to trade a few hours of child care a week.  I'm a little nervous --
make that terrified -- about looking after a second toddler, but it's
worth a try.  Maybe it won't be so bad?  It might be fun, even.  And
one day soon (I hope) I'll have to look after two kids all the time, so
this will be good practice.
</p>
<p>
Oh yes.  I don't know if I should post about this because it seems like
an overshare (I know, I've overshared so much, why stop now?  Because
I've finally realized that family reads this sometimes is why.)  Anyway,
I still haven't got my period back, and I'm getting impatient, so I've
decided if I'm still not fertile by the end of the year I will wean Delphine.
It will suck, but I don't want my kids to be years and years apart.  If
I were my mother I would be six months pregnant with my second child
already.  So, the clock is ticking for Miss Delphine's love/love relationship
with my bosom.

We've been putting Delphine to sleep in the crib, as Blake mentioned
below.  We started about a week and a half ago, with mixed results.
</p>
<p>
The first night we put her in the crib and then sat there like idiots
looking at her, thinking our very presence would calm her and
eventually she would lie down and sleep.  Instead she cried more, 
probably wondering why the hell we were just sitting there and not
rescuing her.  Once we lay down and pretended to be asleep she stopped
crying within a few minutes, and thereafter cried intermittently 
for a while before falling asleep.  It's quite possible that she slept
that entire night sitting up, but we didn't want to look in case she
wasn't really asleep.
</p>
<p>
The next night we did the bedtime routine and then put her down and
lay down right away, and it was much better; again only a few minutes
-- less than ten -- of crying and then intermittent crying for maybe
twenty or thirty minutes until she fell asleep.  (When I say intermittent
crying I mean one or two wails followed by three or four minutes of 
silence.)
</p>
<p>
The following night we moved her into her new bedroom, which turned out
well because it meant we didn't have to worry about waking her up when
we went to bed.  We put her down around 8:30 and then proceeded to go about
our evening like adults.  Adults with two free hands.  Amazing.  (For
the last fifteen months we have taken turns eating dinner because one
of us is holding the baby, we have taken turns brushing our teeth and
going to the washroom, and I have spent half my evenings with Delphine,
half-asleep, attached to a breast.)
</p>
<p>
We had one glorious night where I nursed her to sleep and then managed
to put her down in the crib without waking her, and she slept the 
<em>whole night through</em> without waking up.  We haven't duplicated
that feat, but I have high hopes.
</p>
<p>
I did a lot of soul-searching before we embarked on this process,
probably too much.  It made me realize how privileged I am that
my biggest worry is whether to let my child cry at bedtime -- not
how I am going to pay the rent, or whether I will be able to get
drinking water without being shot at or raped, or whether I will
be allowed to vote.  My mental wrangling
over this trivial matter bordered on the masturbatory, and frankly
annoyed me after a few weeks of it.  
</p>
<p>
At the end of all that I just
decided to get on with it, and soon realized that all the theory in the
world doesn't amount to much when faced with a real flesh-and-blood
child.  It didn't take long to learn that, contrary to my research
she actually cries a good deal less when we're <em>not</em> there,  
and when we don't go and visit her.  If we pulled a Ferber and went
and visited her every five minutes, she would just get worked up every
five minutes and never get to sleep.  "Crying it out" doesn't apply to
this child because she doesn't cry continuously when she's tired, she
cries for a few minutes and then stops, and soon falls asleep.
</p>
<p>
She does cry for longer if she's not actually tired; we made the mistake
of putting her down earlier (got that idea from Dr Weissbluth -- I wonder
how long it will be before I just ignore all the "experts" altogether)
and she cried for a solid fifteen minutes.  We retrieved her and she stayed
up for another hour or so before she was really ready for bed.
</p>
<p>
The crying bothers Blake more than it bothers me.  If I deliberately try
and imagine how she's feeling I get upset, but if I don't it's just noise.
I can easily dissociate myself from my emotions and the emotions of others.  
Maybe I'm autistic. Maybe I'm just a cold bitch.

Yesterday we took Delphine for her fifteen month checkup.  Everything
was generally fine, but she is not growing as fast as she probably 
should be.  I don't know the exact numbers (Blake?) but I think
she has gained less than a pound since her last checkup at a year,
and at that checkup she hadn't gained enough, either.  It could be
that she's just growing in fits and starts, and this is a slow period,
or it could be that she's really not getting enough of the right things
to eat.  (Or I suppose it could be something more sinister, but that's
unlikely and not worth worrying about at this point.)
</p>
<p>
I find it hard to get her to eat -- she will have a few mouthfuls of
something and then push it away, and she is fairly selective about what
she eats.  Today I tried Dr Sears's 
<a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/3/T030800.asp#T031200">nibble tray</a> 
method:
I put Cheerios (multi-grain), raspberries, some potato, and frozen peas
into the compartments of a tart tray (like a muffin tin, but shallower).
She actually did eat a fair bit of this morning's selection, and
(surprisingly) not too much of it got ground into the carpet.
</p>
<p>
She's been miserably sick lately, with some kind of non-respiratory
virus which had her feverish and shaking and puking.  (First puke!)
She hardly ate at all for a few days.  I'm glad we're still nursing 
because that was the only thing she would take -- I couldn't get her to
drink milk or water, or eat anything.  I may never wean her, it's
so convenient.  I think she's better now; she slept all night with
no crying, and the viral rash has gone.  
</p>
<p>
She started walking on Friday; just decided it was time, I guess.  She's
steady on her feet, because she's been practicing for so long.
It's fun and a little thrilling to watch her walking around, as blasé
as if she has been doing it for weeks.
</p>
<p>
She doesn't talk yet, at least not in English; sometimes it sounds like
Cantonese, sometimes it sounds like German.  For a week or so she was
calling the cats "Meeaaooow", so it could be that her first word was
in cat.  Hmph.

<p>
We've decided to teach Delphine to sleep by herself in a crib.  I guess I
knew that this day would come eventually, but I had hoped that she would
decide to sleep on her own, uh, on her own.  Or at the very least to be
able to understand why we were leaving her alone, and to try to work with
us at least a little.  But she didn't, and isn't, and so she cries and
cries, and it breaks my heart to not be able to go and pick her up and hold
her and cuddle her until she's all better.  But I know that that wouldn't
teach her that she's okay sleeping on her own, so I restrain myself.  On
the other hand, I can't help but wonder whether not going to her is just
teaching her that she can't depend on us for help and comforting when she
needs it.  Being a father is really hard sometimes.
</p>
<p>
Update: For the past two nights, she hasn't woken up when we put her to
bed, and so has ended up sleeping through the night.  Here's hoping that
this is a trend that continues.
</p>
<p>
Update #2: It didn't.  She woke up and cried at 4:00 am this morning.  But
I think she might be getting a new tooth, and in pain.  I would normally
give her Tylenol, but it wouldn't last through the night, so that plan is a
non-starter.  Maybe I'll suggest it if she wakes up again.
