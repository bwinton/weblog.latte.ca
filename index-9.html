    <p>I was listening to <a href="http://www.solomedia.org/podcast/2004/11/maximum-geek-episode-5.htm">Maximum Geek 5</a> on the <a href="http://www.ttc.ca/">subway</a> this
morning, and was struck with the need to comment on it.</p>

<p>To start off with, damn Jeff and Josh (the two hosts) are some huge
geeks!  (And this coming from someone who wrote <a href="http://palmblosxom.latte.ca">a Palm conduit</a> to post to his weblog.)
What I mean is that listening to them takes me right back to my days in the
<a href="http://www.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/">Computer Science Club</a>
at the <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>,
complete with interrupting each other in the middle of sentences and
misquoting <a href="http://www.python.org/">Monty Python</a>.</p>

<p>Second, Jeff Kirvin is perhaps the most naive, and I mean that in the
nicest way, person I have ever heard speak.  While I'ld like to believe
that people would pay for content that I could get for free, I just don't
have that much faith in human nature, and sadly, my experience seems to
bear out my conclusions.  I think that at this point in time on the
Internet, paying for something is always harder than not paying for it, so
you need to add some sort of value to the paying copy.</p>

<p>Which means that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York
Times</a> has completely the wrong idea.  It's true that they've cut
themselves off from the rest of the web, and are only harming themselves by
doing so.  (They're a newspaper, why not make the current month
pay-to-read, and open up the archives?  Surely their main selling point is
commentary on what's currently going on!)  So, I have the following
suggestion for <a href="http://www.solomedia.org/">Solo Media</a>:  Put up
text-only versions of your serials.  By "text-only" I don't just mean
versions without any formatting, because given the existance of
alt.binaries.e-books, and the fact that the first few doc readers couldn't
support formatting, having a non-formatted version is clearly not enough of
a difference to get people to pay.  What I really mean "text-only" is that
you should remove all the punctuation, and force capital letters into
lowercase as well!  It's very rare that people <a href="http://www.google.com/">search</a> for a comma, or a semi-colon, and
most-if-not-all of the search engines are case-insensitive these days, so
lowercasing everything won't hurt your searchability.  It will allow people
to quickly find which episode memorable text is located in (and
approximately where in that episode it is), And it will even give people
the flavour of the stuff you're writing, but it will also make it much
harder to read, and probably hard enough that it won't be worth the time to
try to fix it.</p>

<p>So that's my idea for you guys.  Feel free to use it, and spread it
around.  I hope you like it, and may you grow rich off of it.</p>

I just got my period.  My first period since July 2002.
</p>
<p>
And it's appalling.  It's revolting.  It's disgusting.  Why do we
put up with this shit?  It's like Nature herself is conspiring to
oppress and humiliate women.
</p>
<p>
And to add insult to injury when I picked up my Keeper I realized
that in the last two years it has degraded (it's natural rubber)
so I'm stuck using the huge pads left over from after Delphine's
birth until the drugstore opens and I can buy some tampons.

I hope y'all are reading the 
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/~arbrown/reading.html">book list</a> because
that's the only part of this site that's getting any attention these days.
</p>
<p>
Winter is setting in.  We got a gorgeous snowfall the other day, the kind
with really fluffy flakes and no wind, so the snow heaps up on the branches
and telephone wires and makes everything all pretty.  It melted by the 
end of the day so I have no pictures, but I made a point of stopping and
enjoying it and remembering it so I have a picture in my head, at least.
Sorry, y'all are going to have to imagine it based on my inept narrative.
</p>
<p>
Today is Saturday. Delphine is at Baba and Zeyda's sleeping over because
last night was Blake's company Christmas party.  It was at Five Doors 
North, which is just a few blocks away from here.
I got all dressed up in a new low-cut lacy black top -- very foxy --
and my same tired old ballgown skirt that I pull out for every event ever.
I was way overdressed -- most other people were in jeans -- but I am
grown-up enough that I don't care.  I don't have anything else to dress 
up for this year.
</p>
<p>
We are hosting a party here, next week, but I don't think I want to wear
my foxy top -- it's kind of tight.  Okay for standing up or hiding behind
a table, but when I sit it shows all my rolls so it's not good for sitting
on an easy chair.  I think I will wear brown pants and my new pink v-neck
sweater.  (My mother told me to buy new clothes for Christmas and she
would pay, so now
I have two pairs of pants and three sweaters that fit.  What a treat!
I look like I have lost forty pounds!)
</p>
<p>
Today I have choir practice at 10:00 because tomorrow is the concert:
<em>Messiah</em> with the orchestra playing period instruments.  We have
done <em>Messiah</em> a couple of times since I have been with the choir,
so we're really good at it note-wise which frees us up to do interesting
things with tempo and expression and stuff.  Jurgen is really excited.
We've already sold out the concert -- <em>Messiah</em> is our cash cow,
the piece we do when we need money to do a piece with a big orchestra
that isn't going to attract much of an audience, which I think would effectively
describe the other two concerts we are doing this year.  Tomorrow's
concert should be particularly profitable since we only have a small
orchestra.
</p>
<p>
I am still full from dinner last night.  The food was served tapas style,
which is the new trend.  Everyone gets a little plate and they bring the
food to the table on big platters.  I do not like this trend.  First, there
was no menu so we had no idea what to expect and it was impossible to 
pace yourself.  I filled up on pasta and rice (the second course) because
I thought that was all there was; all three starch dishes had meat in them
so I didn't figure there would be a meat course, but I was wrong.  
</p>
<p>
Second, it was very wasteful.  Each
platter from our table (of twelve people) was sent back to the kitchen
at least a third full.  Either they throw it out, which would suck, or they
repackage it and give it to someone else, which would suck more.  The only
non-sucking option is that they give it to Second Harvest or some similar
feeding-the-foodless-type organization.  
</p>
<p>
Third, the people in the middle
of the table spend half their dinner passing heavy platters back and forth,
and you have to bother them every time you want to try something different.
Finally, I just don't do well with family-style service; when there is food
in front of me, especially tasty food, I eat it, even when I am full.  It
is why I am so fat.  So I ate way way way too much last night;  I was easily
keeping pace with the pregnant woman beside me.  Although it
was really very tasty.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and I also had two amaretto sours, which the kind waitress brought 
for me after I flailed around trying to think of a fun fruity girly drink.
I can never remember what cocktails to order, but amaretto sours are going to
be my go-to drink from now on -- sweet, sour, bitter, and girly but not
too girly.  Sadly I might be a little bit pregnant -- I am in that 
post-ovulatory-pre-menstrual limbo -- so I hope if I am I didn't do any
damage.  It was kind of stupid, in retrospect; no-one knows how much
and when you can safely drink when you are knocked up so I should have
abstained altogether.  I hope I didn't screw up.

Morgan was saying she needs more stuff to check on the Internet,
so here are some sites I think you all should read if you don't
already:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://smartypants.diaryland.com/">Mimi Smartypants</a>
adopted a baby girl a year ago.  Her baby is a couple of months
older than Delphine.  (When she first, um, got Nora it totally
blew my mind that Mimi had an eight-month-old, and I only had a
six-month-old, but <em>I had a been a mother for six months and
Mimi had only just started</em>.  I think I was jealous, and
rightly so because it only starts to get good at eight months.
All babies should start at eight months -- maybe I will send my
next one to an orphanage for the first eight months.  Or to Sascha
and Leontine.)  Mimi is very funny, especially the one
where <a href="http://smartypants.diaryland.com/090104.html">Nora
feeds the cat</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.dooce.com/">Dooce</a> has an eight-month-old
named Leta who is much more of a handful than Delphine ever was,
and also a very amusing constipation problem and a slightly less
amusing (but only slightly) mental illness problem.  
</p>
<p>
Okay, that's only two, but someone lost all my bookmarks so I'm
groping blindly around the Internet at the moment.  If I think of 
any more I'll post them, or you could just look at the list of
journals over on the right, but I haven't updated that for ages
and I can't guarantee any of them will be funny or interesting.

For those of you who inexplicably check the blog before the baby
gallery, <a href="http://baby.latte.ca/pics/">there are new
pictures up</a>.  <em>Lots</em> of new pictures.
</p>
<p>
She's napping now so I'm typing on borrowed time, so excuse 
sentence fragments.

<p>
Work:  Have some, working for my father-in-law, liking it but then
it's only a couple of hours a week.  It's a nice change of scenery
and it's good to be appreciated.  The nice thing about my father-in-law
is that he appreciates me.  At least to my face; who knows what he
says about me behind my back -- he's kind of notorious for bitching
about his employees.  That's fine with me, as long as he keeps the
compliments and money coming.  It's not like I never talk about folk
behind their backs.
</p>
<p>
I'm hoping the daycare I put Delphine on the waiting list for will
have an opening in January, which seems like forever but will eventually
come.  I signed up for two days a week, which will be just perfect.
I think she will love it, and I think I will love being able to work
again.  It will be nice to be able to spend good chunks of time at the
office and really make a contribution.  Right now I feel like I'm just
filling in holes and "helping out".
</p>
<p>
Delphine is sleeping well, from seven until six-thirty.  If I were
smarter I would be going to bed at a reasonable hour and getting lots
of rest, but instead for the last couple of weeks I've been staying up
late reading and watching <em>The Daily Show</em> and putting pictures
on the web.
</p>
<p>
The US election is freaking me out.  How can half the country want to
vote for Bush?  Honestly, how a country can be simultaneously so great
and so fucked up I just don't know.  Again, glad to be here and not
there.  It's also freaking me out how much of a news story the election
is here; people routinely refer to it as "the election", not "the
US election".  "Did you watch the debate last night?"  There's a local
bar that's having a shindig on the night of the election, showing it on
their TVs and having debates and such, just as they did with <em>our</em>
election.  (We will be watching <em>The Daily Show</em> live coverage,
of course.  I think I kind of have a crush on Jon Stewart.)
It's horrifying how much effect the results of their election
affect us, and yet we have no say. (Of course, and rightly so, but still
horrifying.  Just vote Kerry, okay, for the love of god?  You can vote
for <a href="http://www.digitalism.com/rhudson/">Rob</a> next time.)
</p>
<p>
I started taking square dancing a while ago, where by started I mean I
went to one class and then bailed.  The second class coincided with a
condo board meeting, and since I'm president of the condo board I thought
I'd better be there.  When the third class rolled around I weighed the
relative benefits of tromping around in circles with lovely old people
to whom I would have to be friendly and polite, or sitting like a tumour
on the couch, and the couch tumour won out.  I would feel worse, but the
idea of signing up was to get exercise, and the old dears move so slowly
that there was really no exercise being got.  I guess I should have seen
that coming.  Next time I'll sign up for step dancing or sword dancing
or something.  In the meantime I'm just trying to go out walking every day.
</p>
<p>
This weekend I'm going to dye my hair back to a decent shade of brownish-black.
I'm still suffering the reddish colour it turned out when I tried to 
dye it light brown, and now it has the brown plus grey roots coming in
as well.  Nice.  
I'm also growing it out, which means it has been and
will continue to be awful.  I got a trim a couple of weeks ago, so it's
less awful than it might be, and I will get another in December.  
My stylist seems to
know what he's doing and to have a plan as to how to grow it out, which is
heartening since in the past all I have done is just stop getting it cut.
Perhaps this will work better.

<p>
I still need to think of a costume for Delphine for Halloween.  So far I
have come up with "70s Baby", "Ninja", and Morgan and Erik need a fourth
for their Kiss costume, but they're going to a party and when bedtime
is seven o' clock partying is out of the question.  I am hindered by the
fact that I do not want to spend any money, time or effort on the costume.
Wish me luck.

    <p>I've recently started exploring the world of writing COM-based
conduits for the Palm in Python.  I had one working for the PalmBlosxom
application I've mentioned previously, and I figured that it wouldn't be
a huge task to modify it to just copy any memos from the Memo32DB to
files and folders in a directory.  And it wasn't that hard.  The biggest
problem I ran into was trying to instantiate an object that I should
have gotten from another object.  The error message was a little
misleading (at least to me, someone who hasn't spent a lot of time in
figuring out COM error messages), but I finally realized what had
happened by reading the documentation.  And perhaps the most surprising
thing was that I started development on my computer at work, and
finished it on my computer at home, through the use of Subversion.  I
figured I'ld have to install a bunch of stuff on my home computer to be
able to build the code, (it currently requires InnoSetup Beta 5, py2exe,
wxPython, and Python 2.3,) but I guess I had all that stuff from the
last time I tried developing something from home.</p>

<p>So, I invite anyone and everyone to <a href="http://www.latte.ca/dav/pEdit-0.2-setup.exe">give it a try</a>.
It'll only work for Windows users, but it should be fine for them.  I
don't know of any bugs, and I'm quite sure that even if there are bugs,
it won't destroy your Palm's data (I do no writing to the Palm, so the
data on it should be safe, right?), and you can always uninstall the
conduit.  That was one of the toughest things to get working correctly,
surprisingly.  There are a couple more features I'ld like to add before
I feel it's ready to have a 1.0 version number.  (Actual two-way syncing
being the main one.  And having a configuration dialog that wasn't just
a big blank screen would be another.  Perhaps switching to the C++-based
Conduit API would be useful as well, for cross-platform issues, but I'm
not sure how I could build a conduit that way.)  And leave me some
comments if you have any problems or suggestions, or even if you don't.
I'ld like to see who's using the little tools I put out there.</p>

    <h4>Words Delphine Says</h4>
<p>
Cat.  Duck.  Ball.  Daddy.  Mummy.  (She doesn't quite know who is which, though.)
Baby.  No.  (Sometimes polysyllabically, Aussie-style.)  Bubby (for
my chestal region and the pleasures thereof.)  Down, as a nice counterpoint to
"up!".  She sometimes says "Up please".  Other times she just says
"Up UP!"
</p>

<h4>Fifteen Month Stats, Finally</h4>
<p>
She was 22 lbs 11 oz, and 30.7 inches, meaning she had gained 11 oz and .7 inches
since her one-year checkup.  That's not very much; she's slid from the 95th percentile
at birth to the 50th now.  Yeah, I know they're not supposed
to gain much in the second year, but more than that.    Anyway, she seems bigger now
so maybe she has had that growth spurt we've all been waiting for.  Her next checkup
is November 17th.

<h4>Sleeping, Eating, Teeth, Hair</h4>
<p>
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/baby/pics/2004/1011/02-w-sleeping.jpg"><img src="http://www.latte.ca/baby/pics/2004/1011/02-t-sleeping.jpg" align="right" alt="Asleep"></a>
She's still sleeping in the crib.  The last couple of nights have been great, the
couple before that not so good, and so on.  It's a process.  I'm surprised by how
she has taken to it, though.  After we go through our bedtime routine (diaper, jammies,
teeth, nurse) she veritably lunges for the crib face-down, tucks all her limbs underneath
her and goes right to sleep.
</p>
<p>
She has just started cutting her canines.  Once they are in each type of tooth --
incisors, molars and canines -- will be represented, meaning she can eat anything
we can eat.  I don't buy much food especially for her anymore, apart from crackers
and high-fat dairy products.  She still loves tomatoes more than anything, and I don't
think there's anything that she particularly dislikes, although she's not very
interested in most things.  Perhaps I am nursing her too much?  I didn't think that
was possible, but then I have only read the hippie attachment parenting books
on the subject.
<br clear="all"></p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/baby/pics/2004/1011/01-w-haircut.jpg"><img src="http://www.latte.ca/baby/pics/2004/1011/01-t-haircut.png" align="left" alt="New hairdo"></a>
I cut her hair for the first time yesterday -- the front is still really short, so
I trimmed the sides and back so it doesn't look so mulletty.  It's much better now,
and she kind of looks older.  I didn't do a fantastic job, technically; the sides
look a bit hacked at, and there are a couple of wisps at the back that I couldn't
get because she kept moving away, but her hair is haphazard enough in general that
my clumsy efforts don't stand out.
</p>

<h4>More</h4>
<p>
All these dry factoids are inadequate to express what Delphine's like, how she is.
She's so interesting, funny, clever.  She loves to be read to, and to go for walks.
She is fascinated by plants.  She can stroke the cats gently.  She dances to music,
bouncing and turning around and rocking from foot to foot.  She likes to clean up,
walking around the house with a rag wiping things, and "sweeping up" with a whisk
brush (really she finds the neat piles of stuff that I have swept, and flings them
around with her brush).  She loves to say no: "Nnnn-aaaa-oooo!"  She is a hundred
times more interesting now than when she was a baby, and I love to be with her.  I
miss her when she is sleeping or out with her auntie or grandparents.  She is both
lovely, and amazing, and I tell her so all the time.
