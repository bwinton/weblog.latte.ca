<p>As I mentioned in a <a href="blake/tech/mac/disappointment.html" title="My problems with the new MacBooks">previous post</a>, I wasn’t really excited by the new MacBooks that were announced this year.  And the more I read the less compelling they seemed…  As I talked with my co-workers, I heard some really good reviews of a couple of models of Windows computers, and since 90% of Firefox’s users are using Windows it’s probably not such a bad idea if I use it, too, both to help me understand the problems they’re running into, and to make sure that the code I’m writing will work for them.</p>
<p>So on Friday I bit the bullet and ordered a Dell <a href="http://www.dell.com/ca/p/xps-15-9550-laptop/pd?oc=nxps15550_bt_h1609e&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs" title="Link to the Dell Store">XPS 15</a> (with Touch screen, 32Gb RAM, and a 1Tb SSD) for my latest laptop refresh.  I <em>think</em> that the recent updates to the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/2016/04/22/windows-subsystem-for-linux-overview/" title="Windows Subsystem for Linux">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> will let me do all the same Unix-y stuff I’ve been doing on the Mac, and if I use the same keyboard and trackpad, I’m not sure I’ll notice much of a difference, to be honest.</p>
<p><img alt="Dude.  I’m getting a Dell." src="images/blake/Dell.jpg"></p>
<p>It’s going to be a few weeks before it arrives, which is nice because it lets me think about all the stuff I’ll need to transfer over, and because it lets <a href="http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2016/11/14/switching-sides/" title="Switching Sides">Mike Hoye</a> go through all the pain of switching before I do, so I can hopefully avoid the worst pitfalls.  😉  There is, of course, a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Transitioning_to_Windows#Applications_.26_tools" title="Transitioning to Windows">guide to switching</a> for Mozilla people, but it’s pretty out of date.  I’ll probably be updating it as I run into stuff, and hopefully the other people who are also switching will do the same.</p>
<p>So, here’s the big list of stuff I currently use, and replacements (where I know what they are):</p>
<p>First off, the obvious ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://slack.com/" title="Slack">Slack</a> ⇒ Slack</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" title="Firefox">Firefox</a> ⇒ Firefox</li>
<li>
<a href="https://about.twitter.com/products/twitter-for-windows/" title="Twitter for Windows">Twitter</a> ⇒ Twitter</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.crashplan.com/en-us/" title="Crashplan">Crashplan</a> ⇒ Crashplan</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html" title="Chrome">Chrome</a> ⇒ Chrome</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, the slightly more complicated ones: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://iterm2.com/" title="iTerm 2">iTerm2</a> ⇒ <a href="http://cmder.net/" title="λcmder">Cmder</a><br>
    Cmder isn’t the same, but it’s the best Windows terminal app I’ve found.<br><em>Update</em>: I might go with <a href="https://conemu.github.io/" title="ConEMU">ConEMU</a>, the program underlying Cmder, instead. </li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/" title="Safari">Safari</a> ⇒ Also Chrome.  Or maybe <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge" title="Microsoft Edge">Edge</a>.<br>
    I use Safari mostly for YouTube.  I used to use Chrome for this; maybe I’ll go back, or maybe it’s time to try a new browser.  I hear Edge has really good battery life while watching video…  🙂</li>
<li>
<a href="https://atom.io/" title="Atom">Atom</a> ⇒ Atom (or <a href="http://code.visualstudio.com/" title="Visual Studio Code">Visual Studio Code</a>?)<br>
    I’ve heard not-great things about Atom on Windows, so I’m starting to look into switching to Visual Studio Code.  So far it seems okay…  I do miss the minimap and <a href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-whimsy" title="Atom Whimsy">Whimsy</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home" title="Dropbox">Dropbox</a> ⇒ Dropbox (or <a href="https://drive.google.com/" title="Google Drive">Google Drive</a>, or <a href="https://www.getcloudapp.com/" title="CloudApp">CloudApp</a>?)<br>
    Mozilla moved to Google Apps for our email, and now we have a big shared space there.  Should we really still be paying for Dropbox Pro accounts for our team?  Maybe not…  Of course, I don’t think Google Drive uploads screenshots automatically, so maybe I’ll also need to install CloudApp for that?</li>
<li>
<a href="https://secure.flyingmeat.com/acorn/" title="Acorn">Acorn</a> ⇒ <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/index.html" title="Paint.net">Paint.net</a><br>
    Totally not the same, but I think paint.net will do <em>most</em> of the stuff I want.</li>
</ul>
<p>After that is the software I’m unsure about alternatives for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://limechat.net/mac/" title="LimeChat for Mac">LimeChat</a><br>
    I’ve been looking for a while, but still haven’t found a beautiful IRC client for Windows.  (Please don’t suggest mIRC, or irssi over ssh…  Anyone who considers those “beautiful” clearly doesn’t share my aesthetic. 😝)  The closest I’ve found has been <a href="http://fooirc.com/#!index.md" title="Foo IRC">Foo IRC</a>, but I’m not sure how well it works.  For some reason I had a pinned tab open on <a href="http://www.icechat.net/site/" title="IceChat">IceChat</a>’s page, but I’m not a big fan of how it looks…<br><em>Update</em>: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/p/irc-explorer/9wzdncrdkmgz" title="IRC Explorer">IRC Explorer</a> looks pretty nice, too… </li>
<li>Mail.app<br>
    I’m not really enthused with Apple’s Mail app, but it’s not terrible.  I hear Microsoft’s Mail app is pretty similar, so I’ll give it a try.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://xscopeapp.com/" title="XScope">XScope</a><br>
    I don’t think there <em>is</em> anything like XScope on Windows 10.  I might just have to go back to my Mac for the kinda stuff I use it for…
    <em>Update</em>: <a href="http://ngwin.com/picpick" title="PicPick">PicPick</a> looks like it might do some of the stuff XScope does…</li>
</ul>
<p>And things I just don’t know about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calendar.app<br>
    I’m sure there’s <em>something</em> on Windows that does calendaring, but will it connect to my home iCal account?</li>
<li>
<a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/" title="Things">Things</a><br>
    I don’t use this a ton these days, but it’s good for keeping track of what’s on my plate.  I may just continue to use it on my iPhone…</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/" title="iTunes">iTunes</a><br>
    I don’t think <a href="http://www.winamp.com/" title="WinAmp">WinAmp</a> or iTunes for Windows are really what I’m looking for here.  I might switch to a combination of <a href="https://play.spotify.com/search/hamilton%20mixtape" title="Spotify">Spotify</a> and my iPhone. </li>
<li>
<a href="http://anvilformac.com/" title="Anvil for Mac">Anvil</a><br>
    Do I still need to run folders as websites?  Maybe not so much these days, since I’m using <a href="http://webpack.github.io/" title="Webpack">webpack</a>a lot more, and it comes with a dev server. </li>
<li>
<a href="https://qsapp.com/" title="Quicksilver">Quicksilver</a><br>
    I think I could probably use the Cortana search menu for most of what I use Quicksilver for…</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.trankynam.com/atext/" title="aText">aText</a><br>
    This is another one of those “There <em>has</em> to be something like this” apps, but I have no idea what it is.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suggestions for any of the apps mentioned above would be very appreciated!</p>

<p>In December 2015, I stopped reading Twitter. It was the school Christmas break, the girls were home and I wasn't working so I wasn't on my computer much, and I was too busy to read Twitter on my phone.</p>
<p>Then I just... didn't get back on again. </p>

<p>I work out every day. Hah, no I don't. I do work out most days, though.  I didn't used to be a workout-every-day person. I got to this point through years of incremental changes and adjustments in my habits and attitudes. </p>
<p>People are impressed that I work out. They say, "I'm so impressed that you work out so often!" They say, "That's great, that you go to the gym every day!" It's one of the few things that I get randomly acclaimed for. (Of course, that says less about the magnitude of the accomplishment and more about what we value as a society.)</p>
<p>But valued or not, exercise is profoundly important. If there is such a thing as a panacea, it's not aspirin or vitamin D or fish oil, it's exercise. It's good for your body, it's good for your brain, and it's good for your mood. Apart from the actual doing of it, there is no downside to exercise.</p>
<p>That's the trick, though, isn't it? The actual doing. The taking time out of your day, the sweating, the special clothes. It's a bit of a drag.</p>
<p>If you want to enjoy the benefits of exercise, you need to minimize the drag. This is how I manage it.</p>

<p>I was listening to <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/193">episode 193</a> of the <a href="http://atp.fm/">Accidental Tech Podcast</a>, and one of the hosts didn’t seem like he understood why I (and apparently many other people on Twitter<sup id="fnref-0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="blake/tech/mac/disappointment.html#fn-0">1</a></sup>) were uninterested or annoyed or disappointed with the new MacBook Pros.

<p>This Monday I turned 41 years old. It came as a bit of a surprise. All my life I've felt a particular age, usually not my actual age,  and it's always been younger, as if I got 
stuck. For example, I felt 34 for at least three years after I stopped being 34, and I think the one before that was 27. 
This is the first time I've gotten ahead of myself: I feel like I'm about 44, and I keep being surprised that I'm only 41. </p>
<p>It has been a rocky year. My last birthday was marked by picking up my family from the airport in Saskatoon, and picking up my mother's ashes from the crematorium on the way out of town. Then we stopped for burgers at A&amp;W. </p>
<p>This birthday was marked by sharing a traditional memorial feast for (and with) our ancestors with good friends who also lost a grandparent on July 31. We had burgers.</p>

<p>I'm going to go out on a sturdy limb and say 2015 wasn't one of my best years. It wasn't an unqualified disaster, though. Let's start at the beginning.</p>
<p>The year started off phone-free, because I dropped my phone down a drain in December 2013. I stubbornly tried to manage without buying a new iPhone, but I finally gave up and blew the $600 or whatever on an unlocked replacement. I'm much more careful with my phone outside, now, so I guess I grew as a person.</p>

<p>Dear Mum,</p>
<p>Today would have been your birthday. It’s been three and a half months since you died, and I thought you might like an update.</p>
<p>I know that of all the places you’re likely to be (and I expect you’re probably not actually anywhere, although Shirley thinks you’re in the blue jays) the Internet is the least likely, so I’m not sure why I’m posting this online. Maybe, like everything else post-mortem, it’s for me, not for you --- on account of you’re dead.</p>
<p>I hope being dead is working out for you. Wouldn’t it be nice if there were really a heaven, and you could be with your dad and your sister again? Maybe even your handsome first husband, who you loved so much. (I didn’t find any pictures of him in your stuff --- but there were pictures of Dad’s first wife. You were way prettier.)</p>

<p><small>(This article is also posted on <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/09/lets_write_a_webextension/">Mozilla
Hacks</a>.)</small></p>
<p>You might have heard about Mozilla’s <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions" title="Mozilla’s WebExtensions Wiki Page">WebExtensions</a>, our
implementation of a new browser extension API for writing
multiprocess-compatible add-ons.  Maybe you’ve been wondering what it was about,
and how you could use it. Well, I’m here to help!  I think <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions" title="MDN’s WebExtensions Documentation">MDN’s WebExtensions
Docs</a> have a pretty great definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebExtensions are a new way to write Firefox extensions.</p>
<p>The technology is developed for cross-browser compatibility: to a large extent
the API is compatible with the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions" title="Chrome’s Extension API">extension API</a> supported by Google
Chrome and Opera. Extensions written for these browsers will in most cases run
in Firefox with just a few changes. The API is also fully compatible with
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox" title="a.k.a. Electrolysis">multiprocess Firefox</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only thing I would add is that while Mozilla is implementing most of the API
that Chrome and Opera support, we’re not restricting ourselves to only that API.
Where it makes sense, we will be adding new functionality and talking with other
browser makers about implementing it as well.  Finally, since the WebExtension
API is still under development, it’s probably best if you use <a href="https://nightly.mozilla.org/" title="Download Nightly Here">Firefox
Nightly</a> for this tutorial, so that you get the most up-to-date,
standards-compliant behaviour.  But keep in mind, this is still experimental
technology — things might break!</p>
<h4>Starting off</h4>
<p>Okay, let’s start with a reasonably simple add-on. We’ll add a button, and when
you click it, it will open up <a href="http://chilloutandwatchsomecatgifs.com/" title="Cat Gifs!">one of my favourite sites</a> in a new
tab.</p>
