    <div>
<p>In December 2015, I stopped reading Twitter. It was the school Christmas break, the girls were home and I wasn't working so I wasn't on my computer much, and I was too busy to read Twitter on my phone.</p>
<p>Then I just... didn't get back on again. </p>
<p>When I stopped using Twitter my mother was five months dead. I was freshly grieving, feeling the weight of being her executor (and the stress of a flood in her unsold house, thousands of kilometers away). I was sad, anxious, and raw.</p>
<p>Twitter was also sad and anxious and raw. Twitter always is. Every grievance, every injustice, every hurt is posted there. A boy is shot by police, a coffee is made incorrectly, a woman is abused at work, a new dress rips, children are kidnapped by religious militants, it rains on someone's birthday. </p>
<p>The world is full of hurt. I am a responsible, empathetic, sensitive person. When I read about hurt, I feel it. And if I don't feel it, I feel guilty about that.
Reading Twitter invariably left me with eyes gummy and head whirling with the ideas and emotions and anger and outrage I just took in. I felt upset, frustrated, confused and hopeless — like garbage.</p>
<p>Twitter is what you make it. If you find Twitter boring or hateful or trivial, it's because you're following boring, hateful, trivial people. So the obvious response to not liking Twitter is to change who I follow so I like it again. </p>
<p>But I want to connect with people I care about, and the people I care about, care about things. Some of them care about feminism, some of them care about racial injustice, some of them care about body acceptance, some of them care about grammar or software usability. All of them post nice things about their families and their pets, but they also post about things that upset them. Which things, in aggregate, also upset me.</p>
<p>Social media is also a huge time-suck. I would open Twitter with a few minutes to kill, or 'just to catch up', and look up twenty or sixty minutes later with a dozen new articles in my to-read app. I was reading Twitter instead of books, and posting to Twitter instead of writing.</p>
<p>In some ways social media is wonderful — like constantly having with you a friend who laughs at every quip and pun, enjoys every anecdote and observation you make. Every pain you suffer, every misspelling you cringe at, every fleeting success of yours or your children's can be shared. Especially if you know some of the people who follow you, and share genuine affection with them, these trivial but constant connections weave a web of warm fondness and intimacy across miles, like those glowing yellow lines drawn around the globe in telecom commercials.</p>
<p>I missed that connection, so I started an Instagram account, joking that Instagram is 'methadone for Twitter'. For a while I enjoyed Instagram — it's mostly pretty pictures and nice things. People do post their griefs and grievances to Instagram, but they're mostly funny, like a misspelled name on a coffee cup, or a normal part of life, like the death of a grandmother or an old dog. </p>
<p>But even Instagram started to stress me out: people getting bullied for being fat in public, or not taking care of their cats the right way. I started to have that same tossed-about feeling when I read Instagram as I had with Twitter.</p>
<p>One day I came across an Instagram post from someone I love saying something that I disagreed with. I got annoyed. If we had been together in person maybe I would have seen her context and understood why she posted it. We could have talked about it amiably until we came to a shared understanding. But I knew that trying to talk it over in Instagram comments wouldn't go well. I felt frustrated and disconnected.</p>
<p>So I quit Instagram, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/09/andrew-sullivan-technology-almost-killed-me.html">And then there was a void</a>. With no social media apps on my phone, there was nothing to do when I picked it up. That void gave me space to notice what I was feeling when I reached for the phone. Often I was bored, yes. Also sad, scared, lonely. I know that social media doesn't help with feeling sad, scared, and lonely — it only makes me feel worse. I realized I was looking for distraction — a pacifier or a counter-irritant, and a way to avoid feeling those feelings. </p>
<p>Now I reach for my phone and tend to my <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/viridi/id1107708818">virtual plants</a>, or hunt for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/little-things-forever/id520762327">little things</a> in a video game. Still distractions, but they don't masquerade as time well spent. When I tend my imaginary <em>Senicio serpens</em> I am obviously wasting time, not 'networking' or 'working on my brand' or 'keeping up with current events'. And the games are finite: when my plants are watered or I have found all the little things, I stop. </p>
<p>I know I'm missing some things now. There are rallies and protests and injustices going on around the world that I am entirely innocent of, unless the CBC sees fit to report on them. I don't know if that's okay or not. I learned a lot from social media that I might not have learned otherwise. But I don't know if I did anything valuable with that knowledge.</p>
<p>I deeply miss the connections with friends all over the world. I miss knowing what is going on in their lives, and feeling cared about when they respond to my posts.</p>
<p>I don't know if I'll ever be back. If I can fix Twitter so that it's <em>less</em> upsetting and allows for <em>more</em> connections with friends, and if I can manage my use of it so that it's not a pacifier, and it doesn't distract me for longer than I want it to, that would maximize the benefits while minimizing the harm. I don't know if it's possible, but it's probably worth a try, when I have time. </p>
<p>But not today.</p>

<p>I work out every day. Hah, no I don't. I do work out most days, though.  I didn't used to be a workout-every-day person. I got to this point through years of incremental changes and adjustments in my habits and attitudes. </p>
<p>People are impressed that I work out. They say, "I'm so impressed that you work out so often!" They say, "That's great, that you go to the gym every day!" It's one of the few things that I get randomly acclaimed for. (Of course, that says less about the magnitude of the accomplishment and more about what we value as a society.)</p>
<p>But valued or not, exercise is profoundly important. If there is such a thing as a panacea, it's not aspirin or vitamin D or fish oil, it's exercise. It's good for your body, it's good for your brain, and it's good for your mood. Apart from the actual doing of it, there is no downside to exercise.</p>
<p>That's the trick, though, isn't it? The actual doing. The taking time out of your day, the sweating, the special clothes. It's a bit of a drag.</p>
<p>If you want to enjoy the benefits of exercise, you need to minimize the drag. This is how I manage it.</p>

<p>I was listening to <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/193">episode 193</a> of the <a href="http://atp.fm/">Accidental Tech Podcast</a>, and one of the hosts didn’t seem like he understood why I (and apparently many other people on Twitter<sup id="fnref-0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="blake/tech/mac/disappointment.html#fn-0">1</a></sup>) were uninterested or annoyed or disappointed with the new MacBook Pros.

<p>This Monday I turned 41 years old. It came as a bit of a surprise. All my life I've felt a particular age, usually not my actual age,  and it's always been younger, as if I got 
stuck. For example, I felt 34 for at least three years after I stopped being 34, and I think the one before that was 27. 
This is the first time I've gotten ahead of myself: I feel like I'm about 44, and I keep being surprised that I'm only 41. </p>
<p>It has been a rocky year. My last birthday was marked by picking up my family from the airport in Saskatoon, and picking up my mother's ashes from the crematorium on the way out of town. Then we stopped for burgers at A&amp;W. </p>
<p>This birthday was marked by sharing a traditional memorial feast for (and with) our ancestors with good friends who also lost a grandparent on July 31. We had burgers.</p>

<p>I'm going to go out on a sturdy limb and say 2015 wasn't one of my best years. It wasn't an unqualified disaster, though. Let's start at the beginning.</p>
<p>The year started off phone-free, because I dropped my phone down a drain in December 2013. I stubbornly tried to manage without buying a new iPhone, but I finally gave up and blew the $600 or whatever on an unlocked replacement. I'm much more careful with my phone outside, now, so I guess I grew as a person.</p>

<p>Dear Mum,</p>
<p>Today would have been your birthday. It’s been three and a half months since you died, and I thought you might like an update.</p>
<p>I know that of all the places you’re likely to be (and I expect you’re probably not actually anywhere, although Shirley thinks you’re in the blue jays) the Internet is the least likely, so I’m not sure why I’m posting this online. Maybe, like everything else post-mortem, it’s for me, not for you --- on account of you’re dead.</p>
<p>I hope being dead is working out for you. Wouldn’t it be nice if there were really a heaven, and you could be with your dad and your sister again? Maybe even your handsome first husband, who you loved so much. (I didn’t find any pictures of him in your stuff --- but there were pictures of Dad’s first wife. You were way prettier.)</p>

<p><small>(This article is also posted on <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/09/lets_write_a_webextension/">Mozilla
Hacks</a>.)</small></p>
<p>You might have heard about Mozilla’s <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions" title="Mozilla’s WebExtensions Wiki Page">WebExtensions</a>, our
implementation of a new browser extension API for writing
multiprocess-compatible add-ons.  Maybe you’ve been wondering what it was about,
and how you could use it. Well, I’m here to help!  I think <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions" title="MDN’s WebExtensions Documentation">MDN’s WebExtensions
Docs</a> have a pretty great definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebExtensions are a new way to write Firefox extensions.</p>
<p>The technology is developed for cross-browser compatibility: to a large extent
the API is compatible with the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions" title="Chrome’s Extension API">extension API</a> supported by Google
Chrome and Opera. Extensions written for these browsers will in most cases run
in Firefox with just a few changes. The API is also fully compatible with
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox" title="a.k.a. Electrolysis">multiprocess Firefox</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only thing I would add is that while Mozilla is implementing most of the API
that Chrome and Opera support, we’re not restricting ourselves to only that API.
Where it makes sense, we will be adding new functionality and talking with other
browser makers about implementing it as well.  Finally, since the WebExtension
API is still under development, it’s probably best if you use <a href="https://nightly.mozilla.org/" title="Download Nightly Here">Firefox
Nightly</a> for this tutorial, so that you get the most up-to-date,
standards-compliant behaviour.  But keep in mind, this is still experimental
technology — things might break!</p>
<h4>Starting off</h4>
<p>Okay, let’s start with a reasonably simple add-on. We’ll add a button, and when
you click it, it will open up <a href="http://chilloutandwatchsomecatgifs.com/" title="Cat Gifs!">one of my favourite sites</a> in a new
tab.</p>

<p>I can’t say 2014 was one of my best years ever. I tried to travel, and failed; the house ate all our money; my mom got sick. On the other hand, my mom got better (and we discovered how much fun it is when I visit her without the kids), and we got kittens.</p>
