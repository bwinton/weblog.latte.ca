This is billed as a "deeply satirical and thought-provoking thriller",
according to the Sunday Express.  I didn't think it was satirical, it
seemed pretty realistic to me.  Unless there's some definition of 
satirical I don't understand, which is quite possible.  Anyway, it's
about this radio DJ who gets into all kinds of trouble.  I didn't like
the protagonist at first because he seemed like a bit of a selfish
prick, but then I got to like him because of his philosophical beliefs,
which goes to show you my priorities are perhaps a little messed up.

Pretty exciting book.  I recommend it.
