I think I should have enjoyed this more than I did, but perhaps I am
more interested in science itself than in when the processes that
make up modern science go wrong.  Still, the book is an examination
of the current state of science: peer review, refereeing, and so on,
and it was good to get an overview of that along with an analysis of
how it's not really working, and what is going to change it.  (Hint:
the Internet is going to change it.)  Also I can't be too annoyed with
a book which spends a couple of paragraphs talking about TeX and LaTeX.

Judson is an impeccable writer and not afraid to put together really
long (grammatically perfect) sentences, which means you can't read this
book in a half-assed manner, when you are watching TV or half-asleep.
I haven't read a book that required actual concentration and focusing
on the words on the page for a while, so it was a bit of a shock.   I
need to read harder books more often.
