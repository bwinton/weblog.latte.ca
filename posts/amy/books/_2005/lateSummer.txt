Here are some books I have read lately.
</p><p>
<em>Reading Magic: Why Reading Aloud To Our Children Will Change
Their Lives Forever</em> by Mem Fox.  I did not love this book.  Mem
Fox is convincing, nay evangelical, on the subject of reading to your
children, and I am all for that, but I found some of her recommendations
intimidating.  For example, she says you must read books with the same
intonation every time.  Well, sorry, but sometimes I just don't have
the energy to do <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> with full vigour, and
sometimes I do.  Poor Delphine will have to deal with the horrible
ambiguity of it all.  
</p><p>
Also Fox wants you to stop and point out rhymes
and play "find the letter" games and stuff, which seems kind of tedious
and teacherly.  Ironically she insists that this stuff isn't teaching;
she calls it "enriching the reading experience".  You're playing!  You're
having a good time!  To me it seems annoying and forced.
</p><p>
I would heartily recommend <em>Babies Need Books</em> by Dorothy Butler
over this book.  Butler's book is not only convincingly evangelical
and encouraging about reading to babies and little kids, 
but it also provides pages and
pages of actual book recommendations.  I found it didn't take me long
to be able to pick out a good kid's book after I had read a few of her
suggestions.

<em>Bloodsucking Fiends: A Love Story</em>, <em>Coyote Blue</em>, and
<em>Practical Demon-Keeping</em> by Christopher Moore.  I don't usually
gorge myself on multiple books by one author like this, but Blake has
been off work and I have been working full-time for the last couple
of weeks, and he has been in charge of going to the library, so this is
what has been new around the house.  The books are good; they are funny
and the characters are engaging.

<em>The Time-Traveler's Wife</em> by Audrey Niffenegger.  This is a
science-fiction romance packaged as a ... I don't know, what do they
call them.  Contemporary fiction?  Those books that come in trade paperback
size and have the kind of fuzzy matte finish and a picture of feet on
the front.  It seems like it should be really confusing, because it 
switches back between one point-of-view and another, and hops back and
forth in time, at every chapter.  But somehow it's easy to follow.  The
story is effectively manipulative, so if you like a good cry you will like
the book, and if you hate to be handled like an emotional marionette you
may find yourself a little annoyed by it.

I feel like I should have read more, but lately I have been sleeping
instead of reading.  I have a couple of weeks off work with Delphine in
daycare, though, so I am hoping to get some reading in before the baby
comes.
