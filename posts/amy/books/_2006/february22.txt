<strong>
<em>Who Runs This Country, Anyway? A Guide to Canadian Government</em>
    by Joanne Stanbridge</strong> is a kids' book but since I knew
    nothing about the structure of our government I needed something
    with small words and lots of diagrams.  This served the purpose
    and now I know more stuff.

<strong>
<em>Fiddlers</em> by Ed McBain.</strong>  Ed McBain is dead.  This makes me
sad.  Ed McBain wrote lots and lots of books, and I have only begun
to scratch the surface of them.  This makes me feel a little better.
</p><p>
<strong>
<em>In Her Shoes</em> by Jennifer Weiner
</strong> is pretty good fluff.  Yeah, they made that movie about it.
I'm sure the book is better -- it's pretty thick and I'm sure they
had to cut a lot of it out to make a movie.  I won't be renting the
movie to find out though.  (It wasn't THAT good.)  The characterization
is a little suspect, though; people change but the author isn't
really convincing as to why they change.

<strong>
<em>Collapse: How Societies Choose to Succeed or Fail</em> 
    by Jared Diamond
    </strong> took me forever to read, not because it's badly
    written but because it's long and Diamond is teeth-achingly
    thorough.  He examines at least eight societies in minute detail
    in order to make himself clear.  It's more like taking a course
    than reading a book.  By the end you're well and truly convinced,
    though.
    </p><p>
    It was an interesting read in light of the other book I read about
    how it's all going to hell, <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/books/_2005/november11.html"><em>The Long Emergency</em></a>; Diamond isn't as
    pessimistic but it's clear that he's thinking something big is
    going to happen within our lifetimes or those of our children
    (although probably not his since I think he's in his seventies.
    The man is awesome!  So smart and sprightly and he has that dapper
    Abe Lincoln beard-but-no-moustache thing going on.)

<strong>
<em>Ingrid and the Wolf</em> by Andr&eacute; Alexis
</strong> is a book for young adults which I would have loved when
I was younger.  I still quite like it now.  It was too short, though --
I would have wished it had gone on for much longer.  As an adult I
see that it is a good length for the story, though.

<strong>
<em>Who's Afraid of a Large Black Man</em> by Charles Barkley
</strong>.  Not much to say -- this didn't suck.
</p><p>
<strong>
<em>Your Two-Year-Old: Terrible or Tender</em> by Louise Bates Ames
</strong>.  You know how everyone says "my kid didn't come with a user's
manual!"  Well, here it is.  This is just a discussion of what kids
are like, and it's one of a series covering different ages.  There
isn't much specific advice, but what there is is delightfully non-judgemental
and pragmatic.  I'm reading the one about three-year-olds, and their
recommendation for dealing with three-and-a-half-year-olds?  Put
them in daycare, because they're at an age where they want to evoke
an emotional reaction in their mother, so they act up.  With a daycare
provider, no emotional reaction, no acting up, everyone is much 
happier.  Failing that, they say, get a babysitter.  Awesome!
</p><p>
They also give some advice which set my mind at ease: they give you
a bunch of "techniques" (ie, tricks) for dealing with your toddler
and getting things done, like saying "Let's put away your toys" instead
of telling the kid to do it and then getting into a huge battle of wills
ending with the inevitable timeout.  If you say "Let's..." then you can
just go ahead and do it without your kid's help, and no-one has lost face.
I had been thinking that I can't do stuff like that because I Have To
Show Her Who Is Boss -- Ames says it's more important just to get through
the day without a thousand battles than to make every interaction about
who is boss.  So, very useful books.
