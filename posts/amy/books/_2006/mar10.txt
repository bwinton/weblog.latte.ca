<strong><em>Your Three-Year-Old: Friend or Enemy</em> by 
Louise Bates Ames and Frances Ilg</strong> is useful, like
the two-year-old version.  They're pretty old (this one
is from the mid-eighties) so they're weirdly time-capsulish.
This one gives a suggested plan for your kid's third birthday,
and it's all "you should be able to manage this with the
help of two or three other mothers".  Presumably Father is
in the drawing room smoking his pipe?

<strong><em>Your Call Is Important To Us: The Truth about
Bullshit</em> by Laura Penny</strong>.  It must be very hard
to write about bullshit, because 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/books/_2005/december24.html">Don
Watson</a> tried to do it, and failed, and now there's this.  It
started off pretty well, but eventually turned into an 
all-purpose lefty jeremiad, with the usual anti-corporate,
anti-globalization, anti-consumer (Evian is naive spelled
backwards!) stuff.  
Not so much with the bullshit.  She also handily ignores
the great steaming heaps of the stuff generated by leftish
groups like anti-GM protesters; as if conservatives have
a monopoly on bullshit!

<strong><em>Me and Mr. Stenner</em> by Evan Hunter</strong>.  I
was glad to find out that Evan Hunter is the pseudonym of 
Ed McBain (actually, vice versa, but I'm  not sure what the
latin for "real name" is) and that he's written a million books.
This one is a book for young adults, and I really enjoyed it.
Hunter is a genius at capturing dialogue, and this is no different,
except it is set (and written) in 1976 so the dialogue is
kind of quaint.  I wish he had written more young adult books --
this is as good as Judy Blume.

<strong><em>Perfect Parents: Baby-care Advice Past and Present</em> 
by Christina Hardyment</strong> is a book which chronicles the changes in
advice given to parents from the 1700s until now.  This is a lovely
book because it makes you realize that despite all the crazy-ass
things people have done with their children, society still seems
to chug along.  It was a surprise to me how much variation there
has been in childcare practices; I had a vague idea that in the
Olden Days everyone was really strict, and now everyone is really
permissive, and that's all there is to it, but really there has
been a lot more subtlety in parenting practices over the centuries.
Hardyment is a historian, so there is a lot of discussion about
how historical events like wars inform parenting.
</p><p>
I would recommend this book to anyone who is annoyed or bewildered
by the variety of advice out there.  I only wish it were newer,
so I could hear what Hardyment has to say about the judgemental
insanity that is Dr. Sears and attachment parenting.  (Which is, 
like the curate's egg, good in parts.)
</p><p>
<strong><em>The Blackboard Jungle</em> by Evan Hunter</strong>.  Evan Hunter --
Ed McBain -- wrote <em>The Blackboard Jungle</em>!  Cool!  So I had
to take it out of the library and have a read.  It's really good.
Can I just stop saying that Hunter/McBain books are really good?
That would save some typing.  It's about a novice teacher dealing
with the, well, crap of working at an inner-city vocational school.
There is an especially good rant in the middle about vocational
schools and teaching and what does it all mean?
</p><p>
Obviously, I think this would be a really interesting book for
Kathryn to read since she is also a novice teacher dealing with
lots of crap, but I am reluctant to because if she didn't like it
I would be very sad.  So Kathryn, I recommend this book but if
you don't like it please don't say anything!
