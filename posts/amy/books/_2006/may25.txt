<strong><em>How To Cut Your Own or Anybody Else's Hair</em> by
    Bob Bent</strong>.  This was indeed useful -- apparently the key to
    cutting your own hair is to cut a guide section in front
    and then match all the other hair up to that section, using
    lots of mirrors to see the back.  I'm pretty sure you 
    couldn't do a complicated style in this manner, but I expect
    it would work for a simple style if you could stand a
    few weeks of wearing the results of your own practice.

    Sadly some jerk decided to cut out the section on how
    to cut straight kid's hair (the straight hair of a kid, not
    the hair of a straight kid -- we don't know about that
    yet), which is of course the one thing I really wanted 
    the book for.

<strong><em>On Bullshit</em> by Harry G. Frankfurt</strong>.  Of the
three bullshit books I have recently read, this is by far
the most successful, with a very intriguing conclusion.

<strong><em>The Curse of the Narrows: The Halifax 
Explosion 1917</em> by Laura MacDonald</strong>.
I love a good disaster book, and this is a good disaster book.
I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had not tried
to read it on vacation, surrounded by a million distractions.

<strong><em>False Alarm: The Truth About the Epidemic of 
Fear</em> by Marc Siegel</strong> approaches the current
American state of constant panic from a more medical point
of view.  I don't know if it's just me, or if it's all of
Canada, but I don't experience the kind of constant fear 
that he talks about, and I don't really know anyone who
does.

<strong><em>The Undercover Economist: Exposing Why the Rich 
are Rich, the Poor are Poor--and Why You Can Never Buy a 
Decent Used Car!</em> by Tim Harford.</strong>  This is
a pretty interesting book about how economists think about
stuff (much like Freakonomics, but slightly less
amusing).  Harford leans a little further to the right
than I am used to, which got my back up a bit, but 
his arguments are convincing, so in the end I'm sure
it did me good.
