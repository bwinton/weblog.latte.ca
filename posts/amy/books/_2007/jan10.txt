We have finally beaten the house into enough submission that I
can sit down and read a few pages in good conscience, thank
god.

<strong><em>Another Day in the Frontal Lobe: A Brain Surgeon
Exposes Life On The Inside</em> by Katrina Firlik</strong> is
the autobiography of a neurosurgeon.  It's well-written and
interesting if you're like me and are fascinated by the workings
of the human body and the freaky things that happen to it.
Sometimes I wish I had done something more brainy in university,
and that I was something more impressive now, like a Doctor or
a Lawyer (not really), but this book made me glad I'm not a
neurosurgeon, or really any of the emergency-oriented
medical specialities.  I love my easy, predictable, homey
life and I would hate to work long hours and be on call all
the time.  Although the saving people and being really important
part would be cool.

I went to <a href="http://www.katrinafirlik.com/">Katrina Firlik's
website</a> and found these 
<a href="http://www.katrinafirlik.com/drawings.htm">funny little
drawings of 
neurosurgery-related objects juxtaposed with objects in nature</a>.
Also the UK title for this book, <em>Brain Matters: Adventures 
of a Brain Surgeon</em>, is a hundred times better than the
North American title.

<strong><em>Cockeyed: A Memoir</em> by Ryan Knighton</strong>
is another autobiography, this one by a guy who started going blind
in his teens and is now completely or almost completely blind.  It
chronicles the hijinks that ensue when you mix normal teenage
stupidity with unreliable eyesight, when you get a bunch of
blind people together at Blind People Camp (blind Tai Chi, anyone?
Blind canoeing?), and the deep, deep badness of going to
South
Korea to teach English with your girlfriend and pretend you're
not blind.
</p><p>
This book made me laugh until I wept; I could hardly tell Blake
what I was laughing at.  Knighton is a brilliant writer and has
a real knack for describing the inherent slapstick of blindness,
without making you feel like an asshole for laughing at it.
He is also unflinchingly honest about his own behavour and
emotions, and the effect he has on others.
I think I will try and find other stuff he has written and see
how he deals with other material.  I hope he has children and
writes about them, actually, because I bet that would be
hilarious.
