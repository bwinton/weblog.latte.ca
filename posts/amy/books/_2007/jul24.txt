Okay, Cordelia is napping and Delphine is busy with <em>Charlie
and Lola</em> and I am for once not too tired to move, so allow
me to type a list of all the books I have read but not yet 
posted about, and perhaps even discuss one or two.
</p>
<h4>Books About Technical Stuff</h4>
<p>
<strong><em>Making the Most of Kitchens</em> by Gilly Love</strong>.
I read this before the reno when we were still trying to figure
out what we were going to do.  It wasn't really all that useful
because I had pretty much made all the big decisions, and we
didn't have that much flexibility in terms of layout anyway. 
However, if
I hadn't thought about what kind of countertop I wanted or
whether wood floors were a good idea, this book might have 
come in useful.  It had lots of pictures of different kitchens
for decorating inspiration.
</p>
<p>
The fact that it was an English book was a little weird
at times; she tries to talk you into refrigerating things.
Now there's an idea!
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The Non-Designer's Design Book</em> by Robin 
Williams</strong> is a very useful overview for non-designers
who none-the-less find themselves having to design or judge
the design of letters, newsletters, logos, business cards,
posters, banners, and so on.  If, like me, you know what
you like but you don't know why, or (worse) you know what
you <em>don't</em> like but don't know how to fix it, this book
is a must-read.  
</p>
<p>
Williams breaks design down into four simple
principles (contrast, repetition, proximity, and alignment)
and then explains how to apply them to make your documents
more attractive and powerful while never overlooking the
most important thing, communication.
</p>
<p>
If I'm ever in a position where I have to create documents
I will definitely have a copy of this book on my shelf.
</p>

<strong><em>Vegetable Gardening From Planting to Picking: 
The Complete Guide to Creating a Bountiful Garden</em> by 
Fern Marshall Bradley and Jane Courtier</strong> and some 
other, slightly thinner but equally useful vegetable
gardning book which
I read rather belatedly this June and July.  My garden is
doing, frankly, rather dismally.  I just brought a foot long
zucchini home from my friend Tanya's garden, while my
zucchini plant has one little three-inch fruit on it.  
Honestly, who can't grow a zucchini?  But according to these
books I should have spent a lot more time and effort 
preparing the earth before planting, and I definitely need
to water, fertilize and weed more.  Maybe at all.  Yes,
there isn't really anything I did right this year, but
the lovely thing about gardening is you can always try
again next year.
</p>
<p>
The books cover everything from planning your garden
(another thing I didn't really do) to harvesting and
preserving your crops, as well as giving specific 
growing and harvesting instructions for a variety of
fruit and vegetables.  The only problem I had was that
the books were written for all of North America, so I
had to selectively ignore advice about things like okra
and peanuts which will never grow in good old Zone 5.
I wonder if there's a good Ontario vegetable gardening 
book.  (I bet the library would know!)
</p>
<h4>Books for Fun</h4>
<p>
<strong><em>The Rabbi's Girls</em> by Johanna Hurwitz</strong>.
I picked this up off the young adult rack at the library
because I am interested in juvenile literature with
Jewish content, if only to know what to steer the girls
towards when they get older and want some context about
their own personal history.  This is a novel about a
family that moves around the US midwest (? I think, 
I can't exactly remember) as their rabbi father
is shunted from community to community (parish?  I'm
sure that's not the word!)  It was a nice light read,
I can't complain.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Does Anything Eat Wasps? And 101 Other Questions</em>
by New Scientist</strong>.  This is a collection of questions
and answers from New Scientist's Last Word page (okay, I'm making
that up, I can't remember the name of their last page) where people
send in their perplexing sciency questions and other people take
a stab at answering them.  This was the first book I read after
we came up for air after the reno, and it was a nice easy
way to get back into using my brain again.  There's plenty 
of interesting stuff in here, but of course my favourite thing
was the question about why some people sound better than others
when they sing.
</p>
<p>
Okay, I only have three books to go, but Delphine would like
me to play with her so off I go!  Maybe Blake will hurt
himself again and post about it.
