I just started making compost in my backyard, and because
I can't scratch my nose without intensive research,
I took a couple books out of the library.  Both named *Compost*.

***Compost*** __by Ken Thompson__ is a glossy, beautifully 
produced little book published by the always-extravagant DK.
As well as being gorgeously designed and illustrated, it's
simple, to-the-point and includes everything you need to 
know to get started composting. It's thorough and scientific, yet
readable and above all, encouraging.

***Compost*** __by Clare Foster__ covers about the same
material as the Thompson, but it's much dryer, preachier, and 
lacks the pretty pictures.

I also re-read ***Freakonomics*** __by Steven D. Levitt and
Stephen J. Dubner__ for the non-fiction book club at the
library. (What is that book, like, four years old? It
would be nice to read something newer in the book club.)
It was good to reread this, especially
having read *Punished by Rewards* by Alfie Kohn which
addresses the issue of incentives. The Steves talk about
how everything can be explained by incentives, but then
give some examples which have clearly been disproven,
as shown in Kohn's book. That doesn't affect the 
plausibility of the Steves' arguments, though, because
despite talking about incentives in the introduction
they don't lean on them much throughout the book.

I liked this book the second time as much as I liked it
the first time. I relish the use of data to
understand the world in ways which are contrary to
popular wisdom, whether it's called economics or 
statistics or sociology.
