Another year, another giant stack of books. Here's how it all boiled
down in ought-nine.

- Total books read: 66
- Adult Novels: 16, of which six mysteries, and six for the book club.
- Young Adult Novels: 4, two of which by Kit Pearson
- Non-Fiction: 42, of which:
	- 9 books about writing;
	- 6 books about parenting;
	- 16 how-to and self-help (or psychology) books;
	- leaving 11 others.
- Memoir: 5, three by Bill Bryson
- CanCon: 12<br />

I felt like I wasn't reading much this year, and I was right. Further, it
wasn't my most profoundly intellectual of reading years. I only
read four adult non-mystery novels of my own accord (the rest were for
the book club). I read
a bunch of non-fiction books, but plenty of them were "how to decorate" or 
"how to garden"-type books. 

Interesting that I read three more books about writing than I did about
parenting. I guess I'm getting pretty confident about the latter, but 
still petrified to take the plunge into the former.

Here are some standout books, in no particular order:

- *Pictures of Perfection* by Reginald Hill is a beautifully written
mystery.
- *A Handful of Time* and *A Perfect, Gentle Knight* by Kit Pearson
both made me cry, as did
- *Elijah of Buxton* by Christopher Paul Curtis
- *Free-Range Kids* by Lenore Skenazy and *Unconditional Parenting* by 
Alfie Kohn pushed me to raise my parenting game
- *Dead Men Do Tell Tales* by William R. Maples and Michael Browning
was surprisingly profound and yet also provided me with lots of
gross anecdotes for cocktail parties.
- I called *Everyday Survival* by Laurence Gonzales as one the best
of the year back in January when I read it, and I was right. It's
astonishing in its depth and breadth, and the way Gonzales brings
it all together is breathtaking. In fact, I can hardly believe it
was so good&mdash;I'm going to have to read it again and see.
- And a special mention to *Getting Started As A Freelance Writer* 
by Robert Bly for planting the seed of the idea that I might be
able to earn a living at this thing I do for fun.

Next year I'm going to try and clear out at least half of the 
two feet of my to-be-read shelf before the end of May. I'm going
to try and read more novels, and I'm going to strive, as always,
to be a more attentive and thoughtful reader.
