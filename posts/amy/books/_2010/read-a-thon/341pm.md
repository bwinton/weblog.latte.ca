I just finished <em>On Writing</em> by Stephen King. I read part of it
on my friend Tanya's couch (oh, Esther), and a lot of it sitting 
on the back deck in the company of three blue jays, two
black-capped chickadees, one chipmunk and a whole host of sparrows
and squirrels.

I took a few breaks: to chat with a friend and with Delphine's piano
teacher, to talk to Tanya (I was using her couch, after all), to
make myself a sandwich, and to set up a science experiment for
Cordelia.

I haven't been drinking water (although that's a good idea) but
I'm going to make another cup of tea. Tea is like water, except
tasty.

Delphine has been playing at her best friend's house for most of
the day. Cordelia started the day watching TV, then did some science
on the back deck, but is now growing restless because Blake is
cleaning the kitchen and won't read to her. Blake's being a real trooper about
being a book widower for a day.
