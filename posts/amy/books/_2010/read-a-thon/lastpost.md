After my last post, I headed upstairs and curled up in bed with a booklight
and <em>Holes</em> by Louis Sachar. I think I read until about 2:30 am,
then slept until 5:30 when I woke up with a stomach-ache. Whether
from the junk I ate yesterday or the coffee or just lack of sleep, I
don't know, but since I was up anyway I read some more. I finished
the book at around 7:30. So altogether I think I read for nineteen
or twenty hours out of twenty-four, which is frankly more than I
expected to.

So I read:

- the end of <em>Moses in Egypt</em> by Lynne Reid Banks
- <em>On Writing</em> by Stephen King
- <em>Raincloud</em> by Richard S. Todd
- <em>Holes</em> by Louis Sachar

I raised <a href="http://www.firstgiving.com/">$210 for Books For 
Africa</a>. (I really recommend 
<a href="http://www.firstgiving.com/">FirstGiving</a> &ndash; the
page was super-easy to set up and they have been really helpful
and supportive, even posting about my fundraising on Twitter.

And now I am all distracted because there are girlies climbing on me
demanding a hot breakfast. I will come back to bed after breakfast.
