I almost forgot to do a post today!

I just signed up for <a href="http://24hourreadathon.com/">Dewey's
24-hour Read-a-Thon</a>. It starts on October 9 at 8:00 am EST, 
and is just as it sounds:
you read for 24 hours. Well, as much of 24 hours as you can stand, with
breaks for eating and personal hygiene, as well as lots of online
stuff like quizzes and things. I'm really looking for an excuse to
just full-on binge on books. I have so many books on my TBR list &ndash;
I'd love a chance to take a good bite out of it.

I'm going to try and hook this effort up to some charity so you (all
two of you) and maybe my tweeps can sponsor me &ndash; to make it
less self-indulgent, and inspire me through those sleepy hours. And
I've already invited some friends over to join me in reading, with
possible optional coffee and baked goods.
