***Peepo*** __by Janet and Allen Ahlberg__ is my absolute very
favourite picture book ever.  It's a rhyming story about a
baby's day and all the things he sees.  He wakes in the 
morning and sees, from his crib, "his father sleeping in
the big brass bed, and his mother too, with a hairnet on
her head."  Later in the day "he sees a bonfire burning,
pigeons in the sky, his mother washing windows, a dog going
by".  (I'm doing these from memory so they might be a bit
off.  I'm tired.)  

The book is set in World War II England and the illustrations
are exquisite.  Janet Ahlberg researched them meticulously
and each picture is rich with period detail.  I took this
book with me last time we went to visit
my Mum, who was a child during the war.  Mum loved the 
book so much I bought her a copy of her own to pore over.  Repeated
readings are rewarded with new details, and the text is
so charming and evocative of everyday family life 
that it is no hardship to read it over and
over (and over and over).  I buy this book for every new 
baby I know.

Also by the Ahlbergs is ***Each Peach Pear Plum***, a
simpler book for younger babies with two lines on each
page: "Each Peach Pear Plum / I spy Tom Thumb."  And then,
"Tom Thumb in the cupboard / I spy Mother Hubbard."   The
smallest listeners will enjoy the rhythms and rhymes
and pretty pictures, and older children can find Tom
Thumb, or finish the lines for you.  This book 
introduces lots of characters from nursery rhymes,
fairy tales and folk tales which children will be
delighted to encounter later: Bo-Peep, the Three
Bears, Baby Bunting, and others.

Apparently this book has fallen out of favour because
the Three Bears go hunting, and Baby Bear is prone to
tripping over and accidentally firing his gun.  I say
pish.

*Each Peach Pear Plum* gets bundled with *Peepo* in 
my baby shower gift
bag (along with "Breastfeeding Made Simple" by 
Nancy Mohrbacher and Kathleen Kendall-Tackett).  There
goes the surprise if I ever come to your baby shower.
