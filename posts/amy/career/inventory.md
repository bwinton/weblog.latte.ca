I looked on the internet for some kind of career counselling
or guidance and I came across [Career Joy](http://www.careerjoy.com/).
I got them to send me one of their FREE 15-Minute Career Test
which promises to help me identify my key strengths and find the
right career for me!  Well, I've taken the test and I still don't
know the right career for me.  I think that might take a bit more
work. But I did figure out a couple of interesting things.
Here are my results.

### Step 1 - Personal Inventory

#### 1. Talents.  What am I good at?  What do others say I am good at?

- reading
- writing
- organizing
- baking/cooking
- talking to people
- making people feel comfortable
- understanding what people know, explaining things to them
	- explaining things verbally
	- explaining things in writing
- proof-reading
- spelling
- typing
- looking things up / research
- managing the household:
	- finances
	- activities for four people
	- food - nutrition / purchasing / cooking
- singing
- dealing with children
- understanding and using computer software
- understanding concepts / smart ("I'm clever!")
- visualizing / spatial / math

(This is going to sound a bit weird, but if there's anyone reading
who can think of anything I'm good at that I've missed, or if you
think I'm not actually good at something that I listed, please
comment.  I'm supposed to know what others say I'm good at.)

#### 2. Passions.  What do you love?  What do you read about?  What do you get angry about?

Love: 

- family
- science and ideas
- facts / truth
- music
- children
- books
- food (Shut up, I do love food.  I would marry it if I could!)

Angry about:

- climate change / sustainability *
- justice: hunger, human rights, health care

(I put a star by climate change because it's really, really
important and if I'm to be any use to the world it should probably
be my first priority.)

Read about:

- childhood development and parenting
- memoirs/other people's lives
- climate change
- science
- sociology -- how people and systems work
- psychology / happiness

#### 3. Values  - what do you value in other people?  What do you believe strongly in?

- truth / honesty
- conscientiousness -- doing what you say you will / ought to
- fulfilling your responsibility as a person or citizen / being a grown-up
- kindness and consideration for others / taking care of the earth
- being good and moral

#### 4. Lifestyle - what do you want from your lifestyle?

- right-size house (3 br, 2 bath, 2 office areas, lr/dr, den, backyard, shed)
- short / bikeable commute from midtown Toronto
- time to be with family
- time to read 
- you know what I would really love?  I would love a job where I could read the newspaper as part of my job!  That would be cool!
- two children (I already have those but I'd like to keep them if it's all the same to you.)
- no additional property
- no car
- occasional vacation

#### 5. Ecosystem/Environment - what atmosphere/environment do you work best in?

Environment:

- clean
- organized
- quiet
- indoors
- personalized (my pictures, etc. around)

(I'm a real princess, eh?)

Atmosphere:

- friendly
- cooperative, not competitive or political

(And a delicate flower, too, apparently.)

### STEP 2: Measuring Your Career Joy

This is the step where you measure your current or previous career
according to what you determined about yourself, on a scale of one
to ten.

How well did software technical support utilize my best and most important talents?  **7/10**

How well did software technical support engage my 
passions?  **2/10**

How well did software technical support meet my values?  **4/10**

How well did software technical support meet my ideal 
lifestyle?  **9/10**

How well did software technical support meet my 
ecosystem desires?  **9/10**

TOTAL: **31/50**

This is where it gets like one of those quizzes in *Seventeen*, 
because they tell you what your score out of fifty means.  My score
gets "Needs improvement. What is your lowest score? What
action(s) do you need to take to make improvements?"  Which is a
little unhelpful - aren't you supposed to tell me that?
Well, clearly my lowest score was in the area of Passions, which
I knew, but what is interesting to me is that the software career scored so
high in Lifestyle and Environment, which is probably why I stuck
with it so long.

Well, it was enlightening to think all this stuff through and 
write it down, but I am going to need more help to
sift through this information and decide which direction to go
in.  Onward.
