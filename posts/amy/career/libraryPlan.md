One of the important things I left out of the 
[career test](http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/career/inventory.html)
is that I want to work part-time for the forseeable future.
Yeah, that's a pretty big omission, because there are 
entire fields of work which do not have part-time positions.
Like software development.

My main idea at the moment is library work, or more generally
information management.  It makes sense for several reasons:
I love books and reading and information, I like to look
things up, I love and understand data and metadata, it's
nerdy and quiet and air-conditioned, while still being
Part of the Solution rather than Part of the Problem.  (At
least, potentially, depending what position I ultimately
take.)

To that end, I am looking at two options,
the first being a one-year Library and Information Technology
Technician diploma at Seneca College, the second being a 
Masters of Library Something-or-other at U of T.  The 
intellectual snob in me wants to go for the Master of
Information Studies, but the pragmatist says the diploma
is the way to go - it's cheaper, it's shorter and it won't
leave me overqualified for part-time positions.  Maybe
people at cocktail parties (or housewarming parties) 
won't be bowled over by my credentials, but that's so
superficial.  Impressing people at parties is not the main thing.
(It's something I really want to do, but it's not the 
main thing!)

And of course I don't have the resources to pursue a university
degree at the moment.  I wouldn't feel comfortable spending
so much of my family's time and money at this stage.
Once I have been working for a while, and the children 
are older, I can think about pursuing whatever university
education seems relevant at the time.  Maybe the girls
and I will go to university at the same time!

The one thing that's still missing is something that occurred
to me today.  I'm reading the wonderful *Unconditional
Parenting* by Alfie Kohn, and he was talking about trying
to see things from children's perspective, and treating
them with respect.  Maybe because I was treated with
respect myself, or maybe because I remember what
it was like to be a kid more clearly than it seems a lot
of people do, but I'm good with kids.  I'm good with them
and I love them.  I really enjoying spending time with
the children at Delphine's school, and I will miss it when
they are older and I no longer have an excuse to volunteer
at the elementary school.

I don't (at the moment) see a path to working with children
through the LIT diploma - I can't work at the Toronto
Public Library with that diploma (apparently they are
intellectual snobs too), and I can't work at a public
school in Toronto because they insist that you be qualified
as a teacher to be a school librarian.  So how can I get
my grubby little hands on the youth of today?  I don't
know.  I will have to look into it further.
