Can I just say I love where music is going now?  We got the
Black Eyed Peas CD and it's all over the place, it's funk,
it's hip-hop, it's metal, it's pop.  And it's pretty much all
good.  I'm so glad to get some new music in the house, I was 
feeling pathetic and unhip listening to classical radio 
all day.  (Although for all I know, Black Eyed Peas are
pathetic and unhip; that's how pathetic and unhip I am.)

Anyway, I'm feeling pleased with myself because I looked up
The Apl Song and figured out that the stuff which isn't in
English is Tagalog.  I guess if I were smarter I would have
listened to the English lyrics and caught the reference to
the Phillipines, but hey, with Google you don't need to be
smart.  Tagalog sounds cool, it's all bubbly and flowy.  I'd
like to speak it.
