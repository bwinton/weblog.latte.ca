Tonight's the first choir practice of the 2010-2011 season, and I'm
uncommonly excited. It's entirely misplaced excitement because at the 
first practice we don't sing &ndash; we pick up music, pay dues, and
then there's a (honestly rather lame) cheese and wine thing. I'm
not interested in wine, the cheese is usually not very good, and
me and the choir have developed a kind of polite disinterest in 
becoming friends. The two people in choir who I'm friends with, I'm
friends with outside choir. Otherwise, there are a few other people 
I quite like,
but the rest of the choir (including the director) doesn't seem nearly 
as interested in me as I feel they should be, and as such I'm not 
moved to be interested in them. I would far (far, far) rather sing
with them than talk to them. So the first meeting of the choir is
a bust for me, apart from that I get to see my friend Janet (Kat is
away) and go to <a href="http://www.xococava.ca/">Xococava</a>.

Anyway, that aside, I'm beside myself with excitement about this
season's repertoire. Mainly 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Lauridsen">Morten
Lauridsen</a>'s *Lux Aeterna*, which is subtle and gorgeous and 
completely doesn't play to our strengths, which are mainly being 
loud and getting it over with quickly. The *Lux Aeterna* has lots 
of sustained, soft,
high passages, so we are going to have to work really hard to stay
on pitch. Without sounding like we're working hard, of course.

We're also doing *Messiah* (snore), Mozart's Requiem which is good fun
except for the parts which aren't Mozart, and Mendelssohn's *Elijah*
which has some lovely parts and some very forgettable parts. (I'm 
listening to the recording of the last
time we performed it and I just heard the creaking of one of those 
cheap folding chairs. Ouch.)

I feel like I've lost my singing voice a little in the last few years.
I took voice lessons for a couple of years before Delphine was born and
my singing voice was a revelation to me &ndash; making such a fantastic
sound (she said modestly) so effortlessly was a thrill like I've never
known. I should emphasise that my voice isn't so incredibly beautiful &ndash;
it's just that I can sing much higher and more competently than I 
*thought* I would be able to &ndash; turns out singing high isn't hard 
work, it's all
in the technique. Anyway, that was then, but since I stopped
taking lessons (and stopped warming up properly and practicing, let's
be honest) my high notes have become less confident (and less high) and
my breath control, which was never great, has become even worse.

So this season I want to work on my high register, breath control, and
also listening &ndash; I'm terrible for getting caught up in my own
singing and not listening to the rest of the choir. I will get to work
on that when I'm working with the school junior choir, too. I'm not sure
how I'm going to work on the other things &ndash; for a while there I
was signed up for a vocal technique workshop, but it was cancelled. I can't
afford private lessons. I will have to poke aroundâ€¦
