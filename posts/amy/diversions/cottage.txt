We just got home from a week at the cottage; at <em>a</em>
cottage, I should say, a place we (or more accurately, Blake's
parents) rented for a week up on Georgian Bay.  The cottage
was right on the beach, and we spent a restful week playing
in the water, sitting on the beach, eating corn and ice
cream and making sand castles.
</p><p>
The first day we were there Cordelia started standing on
her own, and she spent the rest of the week practicing;
she can stay up for about twenty seconds before she plops
down onto her bottom.  As soon as we got home we set her
up with Delphine's old push cart thing, and she loves to
zoom around with it (although she can't steer yet &mdash;
she goes in a straight line until she runs into something).
</p><p>
Delphine spent the week basking in all the attention
from her Baba and Zaida, and conquering her fear of
the water.  She's scared of pretty much everything
these days, so it was great for her to have an 
opportunity to confront something scary with the
support of such tireless cheerleaders.  And she
did great &mdash; by the end of the week she was 
happily walking into the lake by herself, jumping
over waves and playing in the water.
</p><p>
Blake and I had a nice week too, as you can imagine 
with two extra sets of hands around to help look after
the girls.  We both got lots of reading done, and 
we fit in a romantic walk on the beach and a nice
dinner as well.  
</p><p>
Delphine also went through a lot of books; I packed
a couple of Pooh books, a Stella and Sam book and
another library book with a watery theme.  Unfortunately
the cottage we rented came ready-stocked with some
crappy kids books which, of course, Delphine loved.
(I have heard from a couple of sources that children
will naturally gravitate towards quality books,
but Delphine certainly doesn't; some of her favourite
books are garbage and I have to "lose" them because
I can't bear to read them any more.)  Among a 
whole selection of
lousy books (and a couple of good ones; a Robert
Munsch and some Arthur books) at the cottage 
were picture-book-length adaptations
of <em>Disney's Aladdin</em>, <em>Disney's The Little
Mermaid</em> and <em>Disney's The Jungle Book</em>.
(Spotting a trend here?)  You can't really fit an
hour and a half of movie into thirty paragraphs, so
there was a lot of "Suddenly!" and sentences like
"Aladdin tricked
the genie into taking them out of the cave on a 
magic carpet," or "It took a lot of tricks for Baloo
and Bagheera to free Mowgli from the monkeys!"  
I don't remember the movies, but something
tells me that's at least fifteen minutes of film
and no small amount of characterisation and action
squeezed into one lousy little sentence. 
</p><p>
Delphine's favourite of those three was Aladdin.
Her favourite character was the genie, and her 
favourite line, which she repeated all
week, was "Proceed!  Touch nothing but the lamp!'  
which is a pretty great sentence when uttered
completely out of any context in a <em>very gruff</em>
voice by a three-foot-tall girl.  "<em>Proceed!
Touch nuffing but da lamp!</em>"
</p><p>
The girls each had their own bedroom at the cottage,
and the result of that was that they both slept
better; Cordelia was sleeping until 6:30 instead
of 5:30, and Delphine started sleeping until after
seven!  I am pretty excited about buying a house
now.
</p><p>
All in all, the week at the cottage was a success 
&mdash; we expect we will do it again next year,
even Blake who hates the great outdoors.  We will
probably try and get a nicer cottage next year; this
one was kind of, um, retro.
