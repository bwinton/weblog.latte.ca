Blake and I are watching the season 3 premier of *Burn Notice*
(hooray!) and I was trying to figure out who the management
guy in the helicopter was. 

I said, "That's the dad from..."

Blake paused the show while I remembered.

"...from Frasier. I knew it was the dad from something. Cool."

Blake said, "He was also in *Battlestar Galactica*."

I frowned. "Really? Who was he?"

"Not really, but everyone else was."

"Yeah, *Battlestar Galactica* had the dad from *Danger Bay*."
