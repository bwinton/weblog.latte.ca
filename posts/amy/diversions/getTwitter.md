(I rewrote this entry to be shorter and hopefully more useful.)

I'm on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/). I love 
Twitter&mdash;it's a fun way to stay connected, get 
the latest news, and to share ideas and news of my own.

Some of my friends have signed on to Twitter, tried it for
a couple of days, and never returned. I'm going to try and
explain how I use Twitter which makes it so fun and useful
for me, in the hope that people
will try it, or try it again. Because when it comes to
Twitter, the more the merrier!

Before I go on, I will quickly explain how Twitter works.
You probably already know it's a site where you can post
140 character messages. The messages can be read by anyone
who "follows" you.  

Your Twitter page also shows 
your "Twitter feed", which is a display of all the messages
("tweets") posted by people you follow. Note that
you don't have to follow the people who follow you, and the
people you follow don't have to follow you.

#### Getting Started

Signing up to Twitter is easy&mdash;the hardest part is
picking a good username. After you have signed in, fill 
in your Location and a short Bio, to make it easier for
people to find you and decide whether to follow you.

#### Finding your Tweeps

Once you're in, you need to follow some people. But who,
and how many? 
The real key to making Twitter work for you is balancing
the number of people you follow and the frequency with which
you check in. If you don't follow enough people, Twitter will
be boring and pointless and you'll lose interest. If you follow
too many people, your feed will be too busy and you won't be
able to keep up. 

I'm going to throw out the number 75 as the minimum number of people you
should follow to keep things interesting. Of course, it will
depend how voluble your followees are, and how often
you can check in to Twitter. (I follow 225 people, and check in
four or five times a day, and I'm seldom either bored or
overwhelmed.)

Finding people to follow is the fun part. There are plenty of
ways to find people. You probably already know 
a few people who are on, so find out what their Twitter
usernames are and check out who they are following like this:

- Go to the person's Twitter page: http://www.twitter.com/username
- On the right you'll see a number with "following" under 
  it&mdash;click on that number to see the list of people your
  friend follows.
- Now you can click "follow" to follow anyone you like the look of.
  If you're not sure, you can click on any username to go to
  *their* Twitter page, which will show you all their tweets from
  latest to oldest.

Follow anyone who looks interesting&mdash;it's really easy to 
unfollow people later. (When you follow someone they get an 
email notification, but when you unfollow them they don't.)

You can also find people using the "Find People"
option, at the top of the Twitter window. There, you can find 
people who are in your email contacts, or you can search for people
by name. 

How do you decide who to follow? That's up to you; I look
for people who post interesting things about what they are
doing, and interesting links. Funny is good too.  I avoid 
people who only seem
to @reply to other people, and people who mainly RT (retweet). 
Interaction is nice but I like to read original thoughts too.  

You can also follow institutions and entities you
have a relationship with in real life, like 
[@starbucks](http://www.twitter.com/starbucks) or 
[@globebooks](http://www.twitter.com/globebooks), and of
course a few celebrities are fun. I follow
[@SlashHudson](http://www.twitter.com/SlashHudson),
[@Jeffrey_Donovan](http://www.twitter.com/Jeffrey_Donovan),
[@donttrythis](http://www.twitter.com/donttrythis), among others.

Another interesting way to find people is 
[Tweetmondo](http://www.tweetmondo.com), a site which
lets you find Twitterers who live nearby. I found
a couple of people in my neighbourhood, and it's neat
to read their tweets about weather and local happenings.

#### How Often To Twit

Twitter works best for people who are online 
all the time, but you can still have fun with Twitter if you 
only get to your computer once or twice a day&mdash;you will 
just have to scroll down a few pages to catch up, or only
read the latest couple of pages and your @replies.

I don't think it would work to check Twitter less than once
a day, or maybe every couple of days at the very least. Twitter
is an of-the-moment medium and the more involved you are, 
the more you'll get out of it.

#### About @replies

One of the best things about Twitter is the @reply system. 
@replies are a way to directly address another
Twitter user. You put their username in your tweet,
with an @ sign before it. For example, if you want to
@reply me, include "@amyrhoda" in your tweet. Your tweet 
will be specially flagged for me to read when I log on.

You can also reply to a specific tweet by clicking
the little curly arrow which appears to the right of the tweet
when you mouse over it.

To read your @replies, click on @yourusername
on the right-hand column of the Twitter page. 
If you don't have much time to Twitter, you can always
check your @replies page to make sure you read and
respond to tweets addressed directly to you. 

If you want to send a message to another user, but don't want
it to be public, start the message with "d username". This
will send them a Direct Message which can only be read by
that user. Read your Direct Messages by clicking on the
Direct Message link on the right column of your Twitter page.

#### Following Back

As I mentioned above, you will receive an email message
whenever someone follows you. Do you have to follow back 
everyone who follows you? No.  I tend to set the "should I
follow" bar a little lower for new followers, but I still
won't follow you if you're not a real person, if you don't
have any updates, or if you're unspeakably lame. Say.  

#### Have Fun

Some people take Twitter way too seriously. It's not
a popularity contest. It's not a major marketing tool. You're
not obliged to tweet, to retweet (repeat someone else's
tweet to pass it on to your followers), to @reply, to follow 
certain people, to participate in #followfriday, or anything
else. 

Use Twitter however you like, however it works for you.
It's a great, fun way to connect with people. You just 
have to find the right set of Tweeters
to follow, and figure out the rhythm of Tweeting that works 
for you.
