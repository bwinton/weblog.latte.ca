You might know that, until recently, Delphine was just too sensitive
to watch movies. Any kind of suspense or peril would send her running
for the farthest corner of the house. But lately she's become more 
blase about everything, and she is much cooler about scary bits
in movies. "Actually this is pretty scary," she will say, while
holding her ground on the couch. So, we've been watching movies.

We started a while ago with *The Sound of Music*, which is really quite scary
what with the Nazis and all. (Although Delphine was more scared of
the stern father.) Then a few weeks ago we rented *Cloudy
With A Chance of Meatballs*, then *Nanny McPhee*. We decided to
have a regular movie night every weekend. After some discussion
we've decided to have matinees so as to avoid too much pre-bedtime
excitement and bad dreams. I'm excited to introduce the girls to some great
movies, and to get back to watching movies myself, even
if only PG-rated ones.

Last week we watched *Star Wars* (the original one). Cordelia
was really excited to see it, and Delphine enjoyed it in the end.
I think they both liked making sense of all the
stuff the boys in their classes jabber about. Although Delphine 
was very confused as to why Ethan would dress up as a bad guy&mdash;Darth
Vader&mdash;for Halloween. I couldn't help her.

Here's our list of movies to see:

* Bedknobs and Broomsticks
* Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
* Seven Brides for Seven Brothers
* Mary Poppins
* Fiddler on the Roof
* Toy Story
* Beauty and the Beast
* The Princess and the Frog
* Alladin
* The Aristocats? (This is the first movie I saw in a theatre, but I can't
remember if I liked it.)
* Shrek
* The Lion King
* The Iron Giant
* It's a Wonderful Life
* The Muppet Movie
* Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
* Darby O'Gill and the Little People
* The Incredibles
* Nightmare Before Christmas
* Escape from Witch Mountain
* The Wizard of Oz
* To Kill a Mockingbird (maybe later)
* The Princess Bride
* E.T.
* Fantasia
* Babe

Any other classic, or great, kid or kid-friendly movies we should see?
Dave, what about Miyazaki? What do you like?

(Oh, and Columbine's post about <a href="http://www.eccentricflower.com/index.php/Eccentric_Flower:201002/Alice">Alice in Wonderland</a> is quite apropos.)
