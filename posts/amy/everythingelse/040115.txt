Delphine and I walked down to St Clair to have lunch with Del's Grandpa
today, and on the way we stopped at Shopper's Drug Mart to pick up some
stuff.  Specifically, I need some new moisturizer for my face, something
with SPF.  I was going to pick up some Neutrogena SPF 45 I had heard about,
because apparently SPF 15 isn't high enough.
</p><p>
Two problems; first, they didn't have Neutrogena SPF 45, the highest they
had was 30.  Second, the SPF 30 was, I shit you not, twenty dollars.
Twenty dollars for face lotion is too damn much.  I already spend that
for a tub of alpha-hydroxy cream which makes my zits go away, I'm not about
to add another $20 tub-o-gold to my repertoire.  So I ended up getting
another bottle of the Oil of Olay stuff I'm using now, for ten
dollars, which is still five dollars too much.  I'm seriously thinking
of getting a bottle of regular old sunblock and using that instead;
deep in my heart I know that there's nothing special about the stuff
they pour into the face cream bottles and sell for a million dollars
an ounce.  It probably comes out of the same vat as the five dollar
no-name hand lotion.
</p><p>
I also got a box of Natural Instincts temporary hair dye in Hazelnut 
or some such nutty
colour; right now my hair is reddish brown with about an inch of 
dark brown plus grey at the roots, and I want to cover up the reddish
and even it all out.  I'm never sure what colour to buy to match
my natural colour, and I either end up with almost-black or something
too light which makes my hair look too red.  God, my life is hard.
</p><p>
The last thing I got was Aveeno diaper rash cream.  Del's had a
minor diaper rash for about three months now, and the only thing
which really makes it go away is cortisone, and that only temporarily.
I haven't tried the Aveeno stuff yet, and I'm sure it won't be any
different than everything else on the market, but it's worth a try.
It's got to smell better than Desitin, anyway.
