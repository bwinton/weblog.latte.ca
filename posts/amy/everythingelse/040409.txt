I had a meltdown yesterday.  I was trying to play on the computer and
Del wanted me to hold her, but I knew if I did she'd try and mess
with the keyboard and grab things and 
generally be a pain in the ass.  So I gave her
some toys to play with, but she wasn't interested.  Then I gave her
some objects which, while not technically toys and therefore more
interesting than actual toys, are still pretty safe;  I gave her 
a yellow translucent
set square from an old math set.  I gave her a red glass dreidel I 
bought in Venice.  I gave her a rolly drafting ruler.  I gave her the
very best of my random desk drawer crap, and she still wasn't interested.
I begged and pleaded with her to just sit down and play for a few
minutes, but she just hung onto my leg and cried to be picked up.
</p><p>
Finally I lost it.  I yelled, "Would you just shut up!", and picked up the
keyboard and banged it on the desk, which made a very satisfying and
very loud noise, and scared the crap out of her and made her <em>really</em>
cry ("I'll give you something to cry about!") and then I didn't even
have the decency to feel bad.  Instead I got up and stormed around the house
cleaning up, because the mess which I had unsuccessfully being trying to
clean up all day was playing on my nerves.  Delphine crawled
around after me, sobbing miserably.
</p><p>
After a couple of minutes I had cleaned up the worst of the mess and relieved
some frustration, 
and I gathered the poor weeping bundle into my arms and we cuddled and
nursed in the rocking chair and I apologized for scaring her and for
getting angry, and I told her I love her.
</p><p>
And of course all I achieved in the end was teaching her that when Mummy
sits at the computer Very Bad Things happen and it is Scary, and you
should always cry when Mummy sits at the computer, just in case.
Still, I taught myself that getting angry at a baby is not only useless, it
is often actually counter-productive.
</p><p>
I have attachment parented myself into a corner.  I've always held Delphine
a lot, because she is happier being held than not.  I don't know
if that's standard baby behaviour, or if it's my fault for not somehow
teaching her to play by herself.  Indeed, she does play by herself sometimes,
and I might be overstating the amount of time she needs to be held.  And
maybe soon enough she won't want to be held at all, and I will wonder what
I was complaining about.  But for right now, it seems like she is 
<em>always</em> in my arms.  I hold her when I do housework, I hold her when
I cook (if it's safe), I hold her when she naps.  She's eleven months old!
I need my arms back!  I love it when Blake comes
home and takes her so that I can be free to cook and wash dishes without
her clinging to my legs.  (<em>Cooking and washing dishes is my Fun Me 
Time!</em> Fuck!)
</p><p>
And at the same time I feel like such a loser for complaining about my
terribly difficult life when my friend Debbie back home is holding down 
three paying jobs at the same time as bringing up her son.  When I know
there are single Moms out there who would love my problems.  I feel like
such a asshole for not being able to handle a baby as sweet and calm as
Delphine without losing my temper.
</p><p>
This problem is exacerbated by a concurrent but largely unrelated crisis 
of confidence I'm having about my life in general.  I've been thinking 
a lot about what
I want to do with myself, and I'm pretty displeased with myself so far.
I make lots of jokes about being a slacker and an underacheiver, but 
underneath I really believe I should do something useful with my time
on this earth.
It's true that being a good mother is important work, but I don't believe 
that it is enough of a contribution to the world; it's a
good start, but one should give more if one has more to give, which I do.
</p><p>
I'm disappointed in myself that I haven't done more.  I'm disappointed that
I only have a lousy three-year degree.  I fear that I will get to be 
thirty-five or forty and realize my life is half over and I still haven't
done anything useful or valuable.  I'm pissed off that I have this
big meaty brain and I don't have anything to show for it, no job, no
shiny post-grad degree, nothing except a small child with a big meaty 
brain of her own.  I fear that I really <em>am</em> lazy and stupid, like I 
call myself all the time.
</p><p>
I still don't know what I should do when I grow up, but I'm starting to
suspect that I have already grown up and the time to do anything is running
short.
