On this day in 1995, Blake and I started going out.
I was nineteen, in third year (or second? It's a blur.)
and Blake was just about to turn 22.
We had been friends for about a month.  We started
hanging out after seeing *Pulp Fiction* with a group
of friends at a Waterloo repertory theatre.  The 
chemistry was great and we spent all our time together.
Finally on March 2nd we decided to start going out,
and we've been together ever since!

Okay, not much to this post but I wanted to mark the
day.  Fourteen years is a long time!
