So (obviously?) I've been thinking a lot about my beliefs
(or lack thereof) lately.  I came across this good quote
today from Dale McGowan, the guy who wrote the book about
raising children without religion:

> Though I’m sure they exist, I have never yet met an 
> atheist delusional enough to say he or she knows God does 
> not exist. Atheism simply means “I don’t think God exists.” 
> It is a statement of belief, based on the evidence as we 
> see it, not one of certainty. But agnostic is too often 
> misunderstood as a 50-50, “dunno, don’t care” position. 
> That not really an agnostic, it’s an 
> [apatheist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheist). I said 
> that I am a teapot agnostic, then explained 
> [what that is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot).

Actually [the whole post](http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/blog/?p=1578) 
is really good.  Anyway, I think I might lean towards apathetic
agnosticism, except that I find this stuff quite interesting to
think about.  And I quite enjoy not believing in stuff, which
isn't very apathetic of me.
