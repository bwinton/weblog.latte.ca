Cordelia and I are back from Saskatchewan so Blake's adventure
in single parenthood is over.  He was obligingly overwhelmed by
it &mdash; “I hardly had any time to read at all!”, and that's
with only one kid, and the easy one at that.  Yeah, keeping house
and raising babies is, in fact, a lot of work.  Who knew?  I am
only kind of being sarcastic here; I used to think I would feel
guilty about staying home until I realized how much damn work it
is.
</p>
<p>
But anyway, Saskatchewan.  We went to visit my parents, and the
timing was good because my dad just went into a nursing home
so my mom needed help with getting him settled in and getting
the house sorted out so she can manage on her own.  We cleaned
and sorted and went out for lunch and shopped (as much as you
can shop in Big River); it was a regular ladies' week.  Cordelia
was a huge hit with my mum; they read the Sears catalog and 
watched TV and looked at all the stuff my mum has.

<p>
Cordelia and I visited my dad at the home every day, and Cordelia
was a huge hit with the grannies and grandpas, with her big grin
and very loud observations.  “Dinosaur there!”  “See fishies!”
She also pulled out all the grandbaby stops on the last day
and gave my dad lots of nice hugs and kisses.

So there is a huge blog entry just waiting to be written, 
about this summer and how Delphine and Cordelia are doing,
about my thirty-second birthday;  all that narcissistic 
blather you have come to expect from this blog.  Whether I
will ever get around to writing that entry is yet to be
seen, but I have high hopes for this next month, what with
school and all.
