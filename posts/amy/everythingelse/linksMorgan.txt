Morgan was saying she needs more stuff to check on the Internet,
so here are some sites I think you all should read if you don't
already:
</p><p>
<a href="http://smartypants.diaryland.com/">Mimi Smartypants</a>
adopted a baby girl a year ago.  Her baby is a couple of months
older than Delphine.  (When she first, um, got Nora it totally
blew my mind that Mimi had an eight-month-old, and I only had a
six-month-old, but <em>I had a been a mother for six months and
Mimi had only just started</em>.  I think I was jealous, and
rightly so because it only starts to get good at eight months.
All babies should start at eight months -- maybe I will send my
next one to an orphanage for the first eight months.  Or to Sascha
and Leontine.)  Mimi is very funny, especially the one
where <a href="http://smartypants.diaryland.com/090104.html">Nora
feeds the cat</a>.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.dooce.com/">Dooce</a> has an eight-month-old
named Leta who is much more of a handful than Delphine ever was,
and also a very amusing constipation problem and a slightly less
amusing (but only slightly) mental illness problem.  
</p><p>
Okay, that's only two, but someone lost all my bookmarks so I'm
groping blindly around the Internet at the moment.  If I think of 
any more I'll post them, or you could just look at the list of
journals over on the right, but I haven't updated that for ages
and I can't guarantee any of them will be funny or interesting.
