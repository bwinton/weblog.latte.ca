The Toronto Marathon is on today, and it runs right by our place.
This year for some reason the organizers have hired a band to play
to amuse the marathoners.  
</p><p>
The first thing they played when they set up?  <em>One</em>.  The
second thing?  <em>Enter Sandman</em>.  It's good to know that the
go-to guitar music hasn't changed IN FIFTEEN YEARS.
