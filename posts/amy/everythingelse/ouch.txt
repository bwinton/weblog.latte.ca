So.  My back is screwed up, again, probably because I haven't
been doing the stretches and things I am supposed to do, and
generally haven't been doing any exercise at all, apart from
the usual lugging of kids and light housekeeping and gardening.
Apparently that isn't going to do the trick, though, so I am
looking into starting Pilates with Morgan as soon as my back
clears up.
</p><p>
For today, though, I am useless.  Delphine has literally been
watching TV all day.  It's a bit of an experiment; will she
ever get sick of watching TV?  So far, no.  Cordelia has been 
amusing herself in that babyish way just wandering around
exploring toys and things.  Babies are so easy.
</p><p>
I've been icing my back (mmm, icing) and taking ibuprofen all
day, and it feels a bit better.  Hopefully by tomorrow I will
be fine, because tomorrow morning Delphine has her four-year-old
annual checkup and I don't fancy limping down there with her
and Cordelia in tow.  Still and all, I'll manage one way or
another.  And now Miss Cordelia is awake, so I have to go retrieve
her.
