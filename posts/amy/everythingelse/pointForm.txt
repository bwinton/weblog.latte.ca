<p>
This is a nice metaphor, actually: I feel like I only have
time for myself in the form of short bulleted statements.
</p>
<ul>
<li> I just called for an NDP sign for the balcony window.</li>
<li> I am reading books about software project management but
I am concerned that my lack of programming experience will hinder
me.</li>
<li> I am not losing weight as quickly as I would like, but</li>
<li> I am also not eating as healthily or getting as much 
exercise as I should.</li>
<li> I made and then cancelled an appointment to get my hair
cut very very short.</li>
<li> Cordelia is crying and I am ignoring her because I want
to post this. </li>
<li>(Okay, I got her a soother.)</li>
<li> It's warm enough (eleven degrees) that I have the windows open to air
the place out.  It's JANUARY!</li>
<li> My back is kind of sore and I have a chiropractor appointment
     and a massage booked for next week.</li>
<li> I am going to relearn how to skate so I can teach Delphine
(she got bob-skates for Christmas) because I think all Canadian
children should know how to skate.</li>
<li> I am looking forward to getting back to yoga because it makes
my back stronger, it's relaxing and it helps me go longer without
taking a breath when I sing.</li>
<li> I rejoined the choir -- I can still sing a high B-flat (or
higher, but no-one writes higher than that for choirs).</li>
<li> I watch a lot of TV: <em>The Daily Show</em>, <em>Miami Ink</em>, 
<em>What Not To Wear</em>, <em>Everybody Hates Chris</em>, <em>Veronica
Mars</em>, <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, <em>The Hour</em> on CBC
Newsworld, <em>Dead Like Me</em>, <em>American Idol</em>, and assorted
emergency room and decorating reality shows.  I don't watch <em>Desperate
Housewives</em>, <em>Lost</em>, <em>24</em>, or <em>The Bachelor</em>,
so even though I watch a lot of TV I still can't talk about it
with other people.</li>
<li>I like having the window open and being able to hear the city.
I feel more like I'm a part of it.  I will miss living on Yonge
Street when we move.</li>
<li> We probably won't move for another eighteen months or so.  </li>
</ul>
