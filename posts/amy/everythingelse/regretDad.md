I am like my dad&mdash;the older I get the more I see it. 
When I was a kid I thought I didn't have a 
sense of humour, because I didn't laugh at the same things my
mum laughs at. It took me a long time to realize that my
sense of humour is sarcastic and ironic, like my dad's.
(My mum always said my dad didn't have a sense of
humour, either.) I'm like him in other ways, too: we shared
a love of singing, of writing. We shared our insecurity,
our sociability, our interest in politics and civic engagement. 

Despite our similarities, we never had a great relationship. 
My parents
had an awkward marriage, and since I was closer to my mother,
my childhood relationship with my father was strained by my 
knowledge of the hurt he caused her. After I left home, that
distance persisted, even when we travelled together.
There were glimmers of the connection we could have had.
Occasionally we would get talking about politics or people,
I would make a joke or sarcastic comment and the 
phone line would crackle with his rare laughter, stiff with
disuse. But soon we would run out of things to say and
the moment would pass. I never knew how to conjure up
those moments, or I didn't try very hard to.
Despite my best intentions, I could never shake off the childish 
embarassment and awkwardness I felt around him. When I got married my
dad sent me an angry letter about having the wedding in Toronto
rather than in Saskatchewan, and our
relationship never recovered.  As the years passed we talked
less and less, and only 
the topic of choral singing animated our strained conversations.

My dad was fifty-four when I was born, and eighty-seven
when he died.  Maybe if our lives had overlapped more,
I would grown up enough to connect with him as an adult. 
But before that happened, my dad's mind started to fade.
A few years ago I was going through some old family pictures
with him&mdash;he misidentified several 
children in pictures clearly taken in the seventies, as people born 
in the forties. That was my first hint that he was starting to
lose his mind. Later he fell victim to numerous scams of the
kind targeted at the elderly. He grew distant and vague.
Lying awake one night I realized
that he was only going to get worse, that I had
missed my chance have a good relationship with him. We
had passed the point of no return. That was the night I
started grieving for my dad.

A couple of years later, my mum and my dad's
doctors decided to move him into a nursing home&mdash;his
forgetfulness and inability to take care of himself were
taking a toll on my mum. A year after he moved
into the home, almost to the day, he died.  I got the call 
from my mum early in the morning of September 16, 2008. 

My dad and I could have been great friends, but
because of lack of time, lack of effort, fear of failure,
youthful stupidity or elderly stubbornness, we never
were.  I will always regret not trying harder to nurture 
those glimmers of connection.  I will always grieve the 
loss of my father, but more than that I will grieve for 
the relationship we could have had.
