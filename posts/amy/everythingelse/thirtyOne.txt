Tuesday was my birthday, and I am finally thirty-one.  
Thirty-one is a bit more convincing than thirty, which
sounds a bit like you're making it up, or at least
rounding.  And when you're thirty-one you're really,
properly in your thirties, not just, thirty.

Delphine's daycare is closed this week, so I invited
a bunch of her friends over and the day that worked
for everyone happened to be my birthday, so we had
Ursa and Tanya over, and Dexter and Ellen and Maxine.
I was talking to Delphine about our plans for the
day over breakfast, and I said, "Who's coming over
today?"  She said "Dexter."  "Who else?"  "Ellen,
and Maxine."  
</p><p>
I said, "Who else?"
</p><p>
She said, "Who?"
</p><p>
"Ursa!"
</p><p>
"Ursa?"  She looked slightly alarmed.  "Two friends?"
</p><p>
"Yeah, two friends!  Is two friends too many?"
</p><p>
"Yeah.  Why two friends?"
</p><p>
It turned out that two friends wasn't actually too
many, but she didn't like the idea of it.

Anyway, we got some KFC (which I always have for my
birthday), and Morgan and Kathryn came over too, and
Morgan brought cake, so
the house was noisy and full of fun for my birthday,
which I love.  I was absolutely exhausted by the end
of it all, but it was a good exhaustion.  I like my
friends.  And my friends' children.
</p><p>
Then tonight was the family dinner; Morgan and Erik
and Baba and Zaida came over and we had steak and 
mashed potatoes and honey-spice cake which Blake
made for me.  
</p><p>
It has been a nice birthday, unambitious and simple
and thoroughly enjoyable.
