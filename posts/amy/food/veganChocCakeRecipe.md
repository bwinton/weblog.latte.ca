I typed this recipe in for a friend, so I'm going to post it
here to get more value from my typing. This recipe is from
the Reader's Digest *Quick, Thrifty Cooking* book which is
an awesome all-round cookbook for yummy everyday food.
I made this cake lots of times before I even realized it's
vegan&mdash;it's certainly not labelled as such in the book, but it's
definitely quick and thrifty:

<pre>
Vegan Chocolate Cake

1 1/2 cups unsifted all-purpose flour
1 cup granulated sugar
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon vanlla extract
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup water

Preheat the over to 375 degrees F. Grease and flour an
8" x 8" x 2" baking pan. In a mixing bowl, combine
the flour, granulated sugar, cocoa, baking
soda, and salt. Make a well in the centre of the
mixture, and add the vanilla, vinegar, and oil,
then gradually stir in the water. Continue stirring
until thoroughly blended, but do not overmix.

Pour the batter into the baking pan and bake,
uncovered, for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a
toothpick inserted into the centre of the cake
comes out clean. Do not overbake; the secret of
this cake is moistness. Cool in the pan on a wire
rack for 10 minutes, then remove the cake from
the pan to the rack to cool completely.
