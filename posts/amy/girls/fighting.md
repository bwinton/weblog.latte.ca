This just happened.  Delphine and Cordelia have been
fighting all day, apart from some nice long breaks for
*Sesame Street* and *Dora*. Finally the television
ends and after some brief spats Cordelia settles down
on the couch looking at a book, and Delphine comes to
the dining table to colour.

After not three minutes of peace, Delphine says, out
of the blue, with no provocation whatsoever, "You've
been looking at that book for a long time, Cordelia!"

So I said, "She must find it very interesting." Trying
to pretend we're all normal human beings who don't pick
at each other for the sheer joy of it.

Delphine: "It seems boring to me!"

Yet more fighting ensues. Why?  Why?! They were doing fine
and then Delphine out and out picked a fight! I swear
sometimes I feel like wringing their little fucking 
necks.

Delphine just came over to show me the picture she
coloured in for me, with fish and a little pink bird.
She's sweet. Her little neck is safe.
