I've been thinking some more about Guides. There's a lot
more to it than I first thought.  The problems
I wrote about yesterday, with the badges and the structure,
those are problems of unmet potential. Guides
could be a fantastically cool opportunity for girls
to explore their interests and challenge themselves, but 
in fact it's a leader-centred crafts-and-activities club.
Some of the crafts and activities are cool, some of them
are pretty lame, but they're seldom actively damaging.
(Although I wish Delphine's troop hadn't chosen to
do a *bridal shower* for a leader in one of
the meetings.)

But failed potential is only that; it doesn't mean Sparks
has no value. It's an all-girl group of friends separate
from Delphine's school friends, which is important. It's
good for kids to have more than one group of friends; if
one group goes wrong with bitchiness or drama, you have
other friends to fall back on. And it's valuable
for kids of either gender to spend significant amounts
of time in same-sex groups.  On both those counts,
Sparks stacks up in a way that I don't think will be
easy to find elsewhere.

The other nice thing about Sparks/Brownies/Guides is
that it taps into the Guiding infrastructure. They
have programs, they have funding, they have summer
camps and campsites. (Sparks don't go camping, but Brownies
do.) Camping with Brownies and Guides was my first 
exposure to real camping, and it had a lasting impact
on me as it did on Kat.

Guides is also an organization with a rich history, 
and it's represented throughout the world. When I was a kid
I remember thinking it was pretty cool that there were
Girl Guides just like me in places like India and 
Australia.

I've tried, largely in vain, to find other clubs or 
organizations which would fit the bill: a (preferably)
girls-only organization which will provide community
and allow my girls to explore their interests and
challenge themselves in a supportive, pedagogically 
progressive environment.  In the States
they have Earth Scouts and Camp Fire Boys and Girls, which seem
to be much more sciency, and more child-centred, than
Guides. Camp Fire Boys and Girls is 
US only. The Earth Scouts website is pretty horrifying
and they do that stupid badge thing too. (Maybe my standards
are too high.) I've thought about seeing if the ROM
or the OSC have any kind of generic Science or
Discovery clubs, but they wouldn't provide that 
continuity of community that I'm hoping for. I've
even thought about starting something up myself, but
I don't care about this enough to invest that kind
of time and effort into it. (Not that I don't care
very much, but it would be a *lot* of time and effort.)

In conclusion, Sparks seems to be the best of a bad
lot of options. Is that good enough? I'm still thinking
about it.
