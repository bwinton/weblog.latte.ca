I'm not sure this is the post I want to post, but it's on my mind.

Today I did a positive parenting experiment. Normally Blake and I
nag and cajole 
the girls through their morning, until we're all angry at each other
and we end up rushing to school in a sweaty rush. Lousy
way to start the day, so I decided to Sch&auml;fer it up: I would
tell the girls what was expected of them and what I would do, and
then I would step back and let them take responsibility for their
morning routine.

They were forty minutes late for school.

Here's how it went down.
We ate breakfast together, and then I went upstairs to take a shower 
and dress,
with the following message: "You guys need to take your two trips [to
the kitchen with stuff from the table], pack your lunches and snacks
and get dressed. If you have time can you give Thomas his food and 
water?" At that point they had enough time to complete everything
if they got on with it.

While I was in the shower they fought. While I was getting dressed they
fought and then played. After I was dressed I came 
downstairs&mdash;the table was not cleared and they were both still 
in their pajamas.  I carried on without agitation or urgency. I finished
clearing the table while they played, them I folded laundry. At 8:30 I let them
know the first bell was ringing at school&mdash;they were
still in their pajamas, but at that point Delphine started to rush. She
asked for, and received, help packing her lunch, while Cordelia stayed
in her pajamas. Delphine tried to get Cordelia to hurry up, 
and she agreed to pack Cordelia's snack while she got dressed. Finally
we left the house at 9:05, and signed in at school at around 9:20.

I was calm on the outside but on the inside I was freaking out while
they played as if they hadn't a thing to do all 
day. It was a miracle of parental self-restraint. I didn't even 
nag on the way to school, I let being late speak for itself. (When
you say "I told you so" or "let this be a lesson to you" it's called
piggybacking and it turns a natural consequence into a punishment,
which just gets you caught up in a power struggle and demotivates
the child.) Being on time
for school is not my problem, it's theirs. My job is to provide 
them with the tools and information to get to school on time.

Tonight we're going to have a family meeting to talk about 
mornings. My suggestion will be to make a morning routine poster,
and I will let them know that a) I will only remind them of their
morning responsibilities once, b) I will not play with them in
the morning, and c) I will let them know what time it is every ten
minutes. Hopefully they will come up with some ideas of how to
stay focussed in the morning.

I hope tomorrow goes better. I know I'm supposed to be detached
and aloof, but the school expects the parents to "get" their children
to school on time, so I do feel responsible and guilty when they
are late. Also, I have a few morning meetings and appointments coming
up which I don't want to be late for. I'll have to review my 
parenting books and see what I'm supposed when my kids are making me
late. In the meantime I will repeat the following phrase: "It will
get worse before it gets better. It will get worse before it gets
better."

**What I Did Wrong**: I sprung this new behaviour on them without
warning. As I said, normally we
nag and hustle and bother them all morning and I think that's where
they get their clues as to how late they are and what they should
be doing. Today I remained calm and I think the girls interpreted 
that to mean that we were on time, even though I told them in words
that we weren't. Actions really do speak louder.

Also, we were running a teeny bit behind right from the start. Not
behind enough to make us late, but behind enough that we needed to
be brisk. So I would say I'm responsible for about five minutes of that
forty. I would rather our mornings were leisurely but focussed, which
will mean I need to be more disciplined about getting up and fixing
breakfast on time.

**What I Did Right**: I think otherwise I applied the principles of
positive parenting correctly. I remained kind yet firm, I didn't 
get into any power struggles, I told them what I *would* do rather 
than what they *should* do.
