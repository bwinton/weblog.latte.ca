"I want it back!"

"It's my turn!"

Delphine and Cordelia had both decided that the orange sled was the
only sled worth using. We were out with their friend Ursa (and
Ursa's two sleds, the green one and the blue one). There had
been a horrible misunderstanding when Cordelia lent Ursa
the orange sled for JUST ONE TURN, but then Ursa gave it
to Delphine instead of back to Cordelia. Delphine refused
to relinquish it, but Cordelia insisted she must have it back. 

When I stepped in they were in the screaming-tug-of-war stage of
the fight &mdash; I separated them and took custody of the sled,
and then we talked. We talked about Cordelia's preferred resolution ("I want
the sled!") and Delphine's preferred resolution ("I want the sled!"), we talked
about how much Cordelia was willing to compromise ("She can't use
it!") and how much Delphine was willing to compromise ("She can't
use it!") We talked about the possibility of taking turns ("No!")
and using the other sleds ("I want the orange one!") We talked
and talked but neither girl would compromise and I had run out
of ideas.

Then Blake made an excellent point. Both girls were under the impression that
the orange sled was the best, but how could they be so sure? We should
definitely do some experiments to figure out which sled was the best, just in
case it turns out they were fighting about the *wrong sled*! 
They must pit sled against sled in a rigorous and methodical series of distance
trials. First the orange sled with Delphine versus the blue sled with
Cordelia, then the blue sled with Delphine versus the orange sled with
Cordelia, next the green sled...

By the third round of these trials the girls had forgotten they
were fighting, and by the fifth they had forgotten what they were
doing altogether and they were just having fun.

The moral of the story is, sometimes you can't reason with them
(because no-one wants to be reasonable) but you can usually distract
them &mdash; the more byzantine the distraction, the better. Daddies are
especially good for that.
