We've made a couple of decisions in the last few days which sit
well with me.  Little things, but little things which will amount
to big improvements in my life.
</p><p>
First we decided not to renovate the kitchen.  We were going to
do a pretty sizeable reno, knocking out a wall, changing cabinet
doors, new countertops and backsplash, and a new paint job.  I 
would have looked really great, but it was largely cosmetic and
would have been in the neighbourhood of $10 000, probably more
if you factor in the inevitable delays and fuckups.  That's a 
lot of money for a would-be-nice reno.
</p><p>
We decided to keep the money (most of it coming from my stock
options) and put it into paying down our mortgage.  That way 
we'll be able to use it later when we buy a house, which will
probably be in much more dire need of renovating than our 
ten-year-old condo.
</p><p>
Second we decided to set up an "office" for me, with the
Windows box and my Palm cradle and the printer all set up
and the filing cabinet nearby.  This means I'll be able to
go back to using my Palm for appointments (because I only use
it when I can use the Palm Desktop) and I'll be able to print
stuff out and manage the household that much easier.  Right
now it's a bit chaotic, with Windows on a laptop which drifts
about the house, my Palm cradle not hooked up to anything, and
the printer just barely working in a corner.  It's a pain in 
the ass.
</p><p>
Finally, I've been doing lots of little spring cleaning things,
getting rid of or putting away stuff which doesn't apply any
more.  Stuff like my music stand, which I used when I was taking
voice lessons.  I finally folded it up and put it away, which
means that I've accepted that I won't be taking voice lessons
again for a while, and also that I won't have to clean around
it.  I've put away our funky fruit stand because we have nowhere
to keep it; it was on top of a bookcase but up there we never
noticed it so the fruit just rotted.  Now I don't have to worry
about where to put it.  I'm going to put away our wine glasses,
which will free up another two feet of book shelves, and I won't
have to dust them, nor do I have to think about how we're not
really the kind of people who need wine glasses.
</p><p>
It's about getting my physical surroundings in line with the
life I actually live, getting rid of things which aren't relevant
any more, and making more space, physical and mental, for the
things which are.
