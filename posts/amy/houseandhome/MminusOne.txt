Tomorrow we move.  We move from a spacious tenth-floor condo to a 
tiny earth-bound house.  We move from the longest street in the
world to a tiny block in a sweet, domestic, leafy neighbourhood.
From sky to ground, from noise to quiet, from city to... well, 
what used to be suburb, eighty years ago.
</p><p>
Everything is pretty well packed, apart from the stuff we will need
today and tomorrow morning, and Delphine's toys which we left out
to keep everything as normal as possible for her.  We signed all the 
legal papers yesterday, and we should get our new house keys today.
</p><p>
The new house is going to be an adventure, perhaps more of an 
adventure than you necessarily want your primary residence to be.
Between the no shower and the no dishwasher and the ancient stove...
well, as my real estate agent keeps telling me encouragingly,
"it will be like being at the cottage!"  Without the beach
and the ice cream stand.
</p><p>
Incidentally, yesterday I learned that "So are you all packed yet?!"
is the "Still pregnant?!" of moving, and equally annoying and 
unhelpful.  "No!  Piss off!"

We're going to be offline for a couple of days; cable will shut down
tomorrow and the cable guy isn't coming to set it up at the new place
until Sunday morning.  And I am frankly a little skeptical that he
will be able to get it working; I don't think the cable company 
appreciates the depth and breadth of the non-cable-having-ness of
the new house.  (No cable.  Ever.)  We'll see.  
Anyway, the website will be down and
we won't be getting email, so if you want to contact us you'll have
to phone, except the phone will be shut off on Saturday morning.
So you'll have to visit.  We'll be somewhere on Davisville.
</p><p>
See you in the new house!
