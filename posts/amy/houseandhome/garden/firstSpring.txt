When we bought this little house it came with a garden.
A big garden.  A big, intimidating garden which 
<a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/2006/0927/04-w-garden.jpg">used to
be</a> really well-tended and loved.  I, on the other hand, have
never gardened before and have no idea what I'm doing.  This poor
garden doesn't know what hit it.
</p><p>
So far I have spent a lot of time cleaning up; we have a maple
tree in the backyard (oh, and another one in the front yard) and
apparently the primary occupation of maple trees is to drop crap
on you all year 'round: blossoms, maple keys, leaves.  I can
only assume that the maple syrup is by way of apology.  
</p><p>
Blake's aunt J'Anne, the family gardener, was up a couple of weeks
ago and we did a lot of work moving plants from the backyard to the
front -- there are lots of plants near the back door where the 
deck will eventually be, and we are going to try and rescue as
many of them as we can.  We also weeded the front border, especially
under the hedge.  The hedge is doomed; I am going to get rid of it
sometime in the next couple of years and plant something pretty
in its place.  But in the meantime it harbours a lot of crappy
little weeds, and maple saplings.  Stupid maple trees.
</p><p>
Since J'Anne was here I also added a bunch of hot pink impatiens to the
front, mainly because Baba told me to.  I think they will look
nice once they fill out.  They're cute now, but small.
</p><p>
In the back yard, I haven't done much; I am paralysed by the
sheer size.  I did plant a bunch of vegetables: zucchini, corn,
sunflowers, and lettuce seeds, and squash, tomato, strawberry, 
basil, sage, lavender and mint plants.  There are already what
I thought were onions but I now suspect are garlic, as well as
a huge patch of raspberries.  So far I don't think anything that
I have planted has, oh, say, grown at all, but Manuel's stuff
(the previous owner) is doing fantastically.  The previous owners had some
serious green thumbs, considering that most of the garden gets
at best partial sun.  But then they were retired and by all accounts
spent all their time gardening.
</p><p>
Other stuff that is growing from last year includes a glorious
patch of ostrich ferns, some cosmos, violets, daylilies, a rose,
bleeding heart, more ostrich ferns, sedum, daffodils, and some
stuff which might be weeds.  And lots of stuff which definitely
is weeds; I have been preparing the ground on an as-needed basis,
which means there are still lots of messy scrubby patches.
</p><p>
I am overwhelmed by the learning curve ahead of me; there seems
to be so much you need to know to be a successful gardener.  The
nice thing, though, is that it's almost consequence-free.  The
worst that can happen is that I could buy a plant or some seeds
and have them fail.  No-one will be disappointed, no-one will get
hurt, and I'll get to spend some time outside getting dirty.
