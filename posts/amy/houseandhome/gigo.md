Here is the how I throw thing out:

I recycle: plastic containers and glass (the plastic containers
with their lids on but not the glass containers), tin cans, styrofoam,
cardboard cans with their metal lids, plastic bags but only the 
ones from stores, and not the bags that milk bags come in which are
completely identical but for some reason unacceptable. That's okay,
I save them for cat litter. Also plastic
bags must be recycled in bunches, not one by one. Further I save
the bags without holes in them to contain regular garbage and
compost, which means that I have three separate streams into
which plastic bags can possibly go. Also recyclable are newspapers,
magazines, and regular paper but not paper that the girls have
glued random crap onto, nor stickers (too sticky, they gum up
the recycling works).

Speaking of compost, that's the City of Toronto compost which
accepts all the usual vegetable matter as well as any other food
(except gum), paper plates and napkins (but not paper cups from 
coffee shops), diapers, kleenex and paper towels, tea bags, cat 
litter and dog poo but not cotton balls, q-tips, or hair and 
fingernail clippings. (Because that would be gross.)

Outside, there's yard waste, which is weeds and leaves and
twigs and stuff but not grass clippings.

Then there's the stuff which isn't garbage yet, the clothes and
toys and furniture and housewares we don't need. Some of that
I'm saving for the school's fundraising garage sale, some of
it goes into the Goodwill bag for when Andy does a Goodwill run,
and some of the toys I'm saving for that mythical day when I sort
out all their pieces and find their manuals and take them to the 
consignment store.

Finally, as a last resort, there's regular garbage:
anything that doesn't
fit into the above categories, mainly rejected plastic bags and
other plastic packaging, and broken things.

I hate throwing things out because it's complicated.  It's 
hard to believe that fifty years ago people just threw
everything away in one container. How simple! Which
is exactly why it's dangerous &mdash; it can't be that easy
to get rid of things. You have to be mindful of whether your
trash still has value, as a source of energy
or materials, or to someone else in its current form. And
when I'm feeling sorry for myself because it's so hard to throw
something out I remind myself that I wouldn't have this
problem if I didn't bring that thing into my house in the first
place.
