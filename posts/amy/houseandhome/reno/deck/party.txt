<p>And now the details:<br/>
<b>When:</b> September 8th, 3:00 until 8:00 (or later)...<br/>
<b>Where:</b> <a
href="mailto:bwinton%2Bparty%40latte%2Eca%0D%0A?subject=Where%20are%20you%3F"
>redacted</a><br/>
<b>What:</b> Beer, pizza, some kind of munchie thing, and some sort of
fancy blended drink (originally scheduled to be Margaritas, although I
don't know if I'm up for tequila (<i>shudder</i>), so maybe Pi√±a
Coladas, or some sort of Daiquiri).</p>
<p>RSVP, so that I know how much beer/munchies to buy.  Or just show
up and take your chances.</p>
<p>Oh, and one thing I forgot to mention in the email, since Amy and I
have two kids, feel free to bring whatever little ones you have along,
and they can all look at each other distrustfully, or run around
screaming, or whatever it is children do when they get together in
large groups.</p>
<p>
See you there,<br/>
Blake.</p>
