I have so much to blog about and not coincidentally no time
to blog, but I am going to try and squeeze in a couple of
things before Cordelia wakes up and we have to go pick
up Delphine and take her to her hair appointment.  Which
really should be happening RIGHT NOW.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the reno is done and yes I will post pictures.  Well,
almost done; we are missing a light fixture &#8212; we are
reusing an original fixture and it is at the shop being 
refitted with modern, I don't know, bits and pieces &#8212;
and we need faceplates on the outlets in the kitchen now
that the tile is done.  And a deck, we need a deck, although
we might not be able to afford one.  Otherwise it's done,
though!
</p>
<p>
I'm really happy with how the kitchen looks; I think we really
captured the feel of the fifties while still having a nice
modern kitchen.  I am especially pleased with how content
the sink looks nestled on the retro Formica countertop.
</p>
<p>
Now all we need to do is unpack the kitchen!  In order to
make Delphine's birthday cake today I had to buy baking
powder, flour, food colouring, sprinkles, and cake pans!
All because I haven't managed to unpack anything yet.
