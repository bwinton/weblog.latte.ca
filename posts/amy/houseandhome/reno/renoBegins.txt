We signed a contract for the reno last week, and now the work
is beginning.  The work, for now, is mostly just talking about
what goes where and where to get stuff and what colours, and 
Blake and I have to buy lots of stuff; new light fixtures,
appliances, a kitchen faucet, tiles for the backsplash and the
front hall floor.  It would be swell if we had a car right now.
</p><p>
We got a couple of quotes, one which was horrifyingly high and
one which was alarmingly low.  Fortunately the people who quoted
low come highly recommended and they basically lowballed us, I
think, because they like Blake's dad and because they know that
we have years and years of work to do on this house and they
want in on the ground floor, so to speak.
</p><p>
So this reno looks like this:
<ul>
<li>Kitchen:
 <ul>
  <li>new Marmoleum floor</li>
  <li>new cabinets, probably from Ikea</li>
  <li>big pass-through window to the dining room</li>
  <li>new (gas!) stove</li>
  <li>dishwasher (hallelujah!)</li>
  <li>new fridge</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.formica.com/publish/products/en/laminate/classics/skylark_boomerang.Specifications.0001.LargeImage.Image.gif">funky</a> Formica countertops</li>
 </ul></li>
<li>new electrical throughout, because we still have knob
  and tube almost everywhere</li>
<li>new light fixtures some places</li>
<li>knock out most of the walls on the main floor to make
  it more open, although I would stop short of calling it
  "open concept" because we'll still have a well-defined
  front hall and the kitchen will still be cut off by a
  wall, albeit a wall with a big pass-through window</li>
<li>replace the hardwood in the front hall with black and
  white mosaic tile in some cool retro pattern (we'll use 
  the hardwood from the front hall to patch the holes from
  taking out the walls.)</li>
<li>New deck!</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
All in all it's a fairly small reno; we are not adding any
rooms or messing with any outside walls.  It is scheduled
to take about a month, with the actual work beginning
mid-March.
</p><p>
I am really excited; once the reno is done we will still
have a crappy old house, but it will be a crappy old house
with a really nice, functional kitchen and light switches
in logical places, and I can deal with that!
