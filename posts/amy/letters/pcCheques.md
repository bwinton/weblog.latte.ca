Here's a letter I sent to President's Choice Financial 
Mastercard.

> Hi,

> me how environmentally friendly they are.

> To add insult to injury, I called the customer support

> Thanks for your attention to this matter.


Incidentally, I read the fine print on the "convenience
cheques" and realized what a bum deal they are, so I'm 
going to go back to regular cheques anyway.
