<p>
I just got back from a 2.3K run of eight and ones.  It was hard;
I am still a little wheezy and having trouble catching my breath.
But I am quite pleased with myself for doing it; it was already
8:30 by the time I went out, and I really wanted to stay home
and sit on the couch.  We have our
condo on the market (anyone want a condo?) and I have spent the
last week cleaning and tidying like a fool instead of running
and sleeping and doing other sensible things.

I haven't been keeping up with the homework for the Learn To
Run clinic; you are supposed to run three times a week but
I have only gone once this week and it's already Thursday
(clinic meets on Saturday).  This week we are doing 4.75K of
nine and ones and I am going to be suffering.  Hopefully, though,
now that the condo is clean and tidy I will be able to get back
to three runs a week.

And hey, back in June when I started all this foolishness I
wouldn't even have been able to <em>think</em> of running for
eight minutes without stopping.  So that's something.
