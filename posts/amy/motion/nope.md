Well.  Didn't take long for that train to come off the tracks.
I haven't gone running since last time I posted, which was about a 
century ago.  First I got sick, then once I was better it was
all icy and cold, and then I just couldn't carve out a good
time.  Augh.

Ah well.  Reset.  Try again.  And again and again and again.
