I feel strangely deflated now that my first run is behind me,
although I have another month to go in my running clinic to give me
something to work on.  (We are doing eight and ones next
weekend; how I am going to go from five and twos to eight and ones
I do not know).
</p><p>
I think I will sign up for a 5K sometime this winter or early 
spring to keep me honest over the winter and give me something to 
aim for: I 
would like to improve my time by running for a larger proportion
of the time.  I will need some kind of external incentive because
I can really see myself forgetting about running altogether in
the chilly winter evenings.  Although I bet Michelle wouldn't let
me.
</p><p>
In the summer of '07 I will do two or three 5Ks, then
maybe another over the winter (if I feel like I need it to keep
my momentum up).  Then in '08 I'd like to do the Sporting Life
10K (because it's mainly downhill!) and the 10K in the zoo
(because the zoo is cool).
Maybe by '09 I'll be ready for a half-marathon, or maybe I will
do a couple more 10Ks, and do a half-marathon in '10... we'll see.

Of course this could be derailed by unforseen circumstances, but
so could any plan; no reason not to make it!
