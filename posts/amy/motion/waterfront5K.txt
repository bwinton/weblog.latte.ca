<p>
I did it, I finished my first run!  I did the Scotiabank Toronto
Waterfront 5K in 42 minutes, doing
intervals of two minutes of walking and five minutes of running.
It was a good pace, fairly challenging but not so hard that I felt
like I wasn't going to make it.

It was cool to run in a real race, although there was a marked
difference between the 5K and the "real" races; we had little
kids, people with special needs, people who clearly intended to
amble the route (not that there's anything wrong with a nice
amble, but I'm not sure I'd choose Lakeshore for it).  There
was even a woman enjoying a nice, bracing cigarette before the
race began!  But hey, it was a good start and I'm really glad I
did it.
