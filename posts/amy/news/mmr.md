Just a [quick link](http://www.rationalmoms.com/2009/02/09/mmr-autism-the-books-were-cooked/) to a blog post on Rational Moms about how
the data in that one study which linked the MMR vaccine
to autism was manipulated.

I hope the lives of those two children weigh heavily on
Dr Wakefield's conscience.  I bet they don't.
