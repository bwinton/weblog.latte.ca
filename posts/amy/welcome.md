Greetings, visitors, and welcome to our funny little blog. Blog-o!
is written by me (Amy)&mdash;I'm a stay-at-home mother who loves to
read, write, bake, and blog about all of those things and anything
else&mdash;and my husband Blake, who is a full-time work-from-home 
coder who likes to bike and eat my baking. 

This blog is hard
to put into a category&mdash;some days it's a 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/girls/">mommy blog</a>, some
days it's a <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/books/">book
blog</a>, some days it's a <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/">coding
blog</a>, some days it's just an 
<a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/whingeing/">annoying self-absorbed
emo blog</a>. It's not what you'd call a focussed writing project. 
But it's us, and some people think we're pretty amusing. We'd love
it if you stay awhile, poke around, maybe drop us a note. Enjoy!

(Note to regular readers: I wrote a 
<a href="http://www.notimeforflashcards.com/2009/12/green-christmas-crafts.html">guest post</a> for Allie at <a href="http://www.notimeforflashcards.com/">No Time For Flash Cards</a> and she was kind enough to link back to Blog-o!, so I thought I'd better say "Hi" to those nice people.)
