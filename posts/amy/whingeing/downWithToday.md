1. sinus infection
2. Delphine fell downstairs
3. I left the bacon my friend gave me unrefrigerated overnight
4. minus 27&deg;C with windchill
5. both my children hate school and don't want to go
6. I don't blame them (actually I'm glad they have the wit to realize what 
a scam school is.)
7. all my usual boring existential angst

And two reasons today is okay:

1. My children are creative and clever and interesting.
2. The sun is shining.
