I can’t say 2014 was one of my best years ever. I tried to travel, and failed; the house ate all our money; my mom got sick. On the other hand, my mom got better (and we discovered how much fun it is when I visit her without the kids), and we got kittens.

### Turned Away

In March and April I was meant to go to San Francisco for work things. I was to
be there for two weeks, with a week back home in between. (The two events were
unrelated -- it was pure coincidence that they were so close together and both
in San Francisco.)

Both times I was turned back at the US border, the first time on the grounds
that I would be working in the US without a proper visa and “taking work away
from an American citizen”, and the second time on the grounds that I was
obviously trying it again. This is absurd, of course, because at the time the
work I was doing, from my home in Toronto, was *all* work that could have been
done by an American: sending email, selling event tickets, setting up
websites. Basically anyone who does computer-based work for a US company
anywhere in the world is stealing work from the hands of an American.
The rules are anachronistic and ridiculous, but that didn’t stop the border
control staff from calling me a liar and sending me home, with visible pleasure
and mockery, two weeks in a row.

Adding insult to injury, everyone I told about my experience replied with pithy
post hoc advice like, “Oh, I just say I’m going to meetings,” or “I say I’m
visiting friends from college.” Apparently I am the only person dumb enough to
be honest at border control.

So now I may or may not have a black mark on my file; there is no way to know
apart from trying to get into the US again, which I’m not going to do. I’m sad
that I won’t be able to go to New York or Chicago or Boston or Portland again,
and I’d love to go to New Orleans or San Francisco. But it’s just not worth the
risk of paying for a trip I can’t go on, and of being bullied and harrassed by
thick-necked extras from a Phil Zimbardo experiment.

### Kitty Kitties

Our old cat Thomas died in November 2013, and by February of last year the
house was starting to feel very quiet and empty. We were ready for new cats. I
learned that, like tomatoes, cats have a season: apparently there is a kitten
rush in spring, sometime around April. In February, April seemed a long way
away, so I started checking the cat rescue and humane society websites anyway.
It wasn’t long before we all fell in love with Peaches and Prince, two 
gorgeous balls of champagne-coloured fluff who were being fostered for Toronto
Cat Rescue.

I called TCR to see about adopting them, but the lady who answered the phone
put me off right away when she heard that we don’t have a car. The kittens were
being fostered near Kitchener, and without a way for us to pick them up the
agency wasn’t interested in moving forward. “We will have lots of cats in your
neighbourhood in a few weeks,” she said.

Okay. 

I guess. 

I wanted to let it go but... they were *so sweet*! 

I have a friend who fosters for TCR, and I asked her, ever so casually, if
Peaches and Prince were her fosters. She said they weren’t but she knew the
foster mom, and from there things just fell into place. My friend pursuaded the
foster mom to drive the kittens to Toronto (!) and soon they were ours.

We renamed them Fern and Elijah, and they are a source of unceasing amusement,
annoyance, and affection. Elijah has grown handsome and bold, and Fern is a
slightly larger version of the fluffy kitten she was when she arrived.

### The Money Pit

Last year we replaced half the roof, waterproofed the basement, replaced the
furnace, and replaced a drain just outside the house. The roof was an
emergency, the drain was an emergency, we did the basement because the timing
was expedient (our neighbour was doing hers and we got a better price to do
them together (because our houses are so close together they only needed to dig
one trench!)) and the furnace was 24 years old and sputtered threateningly last
winter.

It’s nice to have a house that’s a little warmer and more watertight than it
was before (except where it shouldn’t be watertight, like in the drains) but I
do wish it didn’t all have to happen in one year. I hope next year (and maybe
the one after) are a little less exciting, home-improvement-wise. We can put
some effort into improving our line of credit, instead.
