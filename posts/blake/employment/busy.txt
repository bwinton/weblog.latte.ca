So <a href="http://www.phantomfiber.com/">my company</a> <a
href="http://www.phantomfiber.com/"><img

align="right"/></a> is on the virge of getting a bunch of new work,
which means that I might be back on client development.  But not
quite yet, since there is a bunch of framework-ish stuff that I
can do before that.  A couple of new games, with the necessary
changes to the base stuff to support them in as simple a way as
possible.  But before any of that, I get to make our demo project
compile.  That was a bigger pain than I thought it would be,
since we renamed it from "PhantomGaming" to "PgCasino",
necessating wide-sweeping changes in many source files, as well
as different settings in the project files.  But it compiles now,
so in theory, on Monday, I can start implementing the new games.
Should be fun.
