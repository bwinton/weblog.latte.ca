As Amy mentioned in the previous post, her father passed away.  So she’s
gone out to Saskatchewan to spend some time with her mother.  This means
that for the next seven days, I get to stay home and take care of the
kids, making sure that they have food to eat, clothes to wear, and get
to wherever they’re going when they need to be there.

The first day went pretty well, the only casualty being a
slightly-charred side of a grilled bacon-tomato-cheese sandwich.  And
today has been going pretty well too, with a load of laundry washed and
hung, the dishwasher currently running, and tonight’s meal (beef stew in
the crock pot) already cooking.

A large part of why it’s all running so smoothly is my parents.  They
have totally stepped up, helping me by taking Delphine and Cordelia
places, or just looking after them while I do the stuff that needs to be
done around the house.

Delphine has been a huge help too.  This morning, while I was in the
shower, she got dressed, came downstairs, got out three bowls and three
small spoons, some cereal, and the milk from the fridge.  She then
poured cereal for herself and Cordelia, and the two of them were done
breakfast before I was dressed.  I know she’s five and all, but
sometimes she’s so grown up it astonishes me.

Anyways, they’re currently out on an adventure with Zaida, so I’ld
better get to folding the laundry, because it ain’t gonna fold itself.
