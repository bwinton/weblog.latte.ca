### [Daniel](http://grbmozilla.wordpress.com/)’s QuickLook Support

There’s [an extension](http://bitbucket.org/libras2909/qlplugin/src)
which adds QuickLook support to Thunderbird.  To run correctly, it needs
a patch to msgHdrOverlay (included in the repo).

The extension is also packaged as a set of changes to Thunderbird, which
you can find [over here](http://bitbucket.org/libras2909/ql-enabler/src
).  Daniel is working on testing those changes and then turning them
into a patch which we can review, and eventually add to Thunderbird.
For now, the changes to Thunderbird need to go in a qlxpcom subdirectory
under mailnews/extensions, and there are two diffs which need to be
applied.  See [bug 457546](
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=457546) for updates.

### [Ian](http://ilienert.wordpress.com/)’s Improved Attachment Handling

Ian decided that the easiest way forward on this would be to concentrate
on the [DataMiners](
http://hg.mozilla.org/users/bwinton_latte.ca/dataminers/summary)
extension.  He did all of his work in [a fork](
https://bitbucket.org/ilienert/dataminers/src) on BitBucket, but it has
since been pulled into the official repository.

I’m quite happy with the amount of work they both put in, and am looking
forward to seeing them continue to develop their projects in the future.
