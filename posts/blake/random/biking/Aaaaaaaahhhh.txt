<p>Since it was such a nice day today, I rode home a little slower
than I otherwise would, and it was really nice.  I talked to a
woman biking along holding on to another bicycle beside her
(apparently it's not as hard as it looks), and a man who took a
shorter route to Summerhill and MacLennen than I do.  People seem
really nice to each other when they're on bicycles...</p>

<p>While I was cycling east along Gerrard, I noticed several police
motorcycles blocking the bike lane.  The cops were more than happy
to wave me through, but does anyone know why there were there?</p>

<p>And finally, the interesting thing.  On Merton, I was biking
fairly closely behind a car (but slowly, because there are a lot of
speed bumps), when they hit the brakes and turned right into a
parking spot.  I grabbed my front brake hard to slow down, and it
went *ping* and offered no resistance.  So I hit my back brake, and
slowed right down, but apparently when I grabbed my front brake I
snapped the cable!  First time I've ever done that, and it was kind
of exciting in a "I don't really want to do that again" kind of way.
I got to the local bike shop (Sport Swap, now just south of Bayview
and Davisville!  Sadly the new location didn't make it into the 2007
Bike Map, which lists the old location (now a Trek Store), so I
figured I'ld throw the info here, since they've been really nice to
me.)  Uh, anyways, where was I?  Oh, yeah, I got to the local bike
shop just after they closed, so I couldn't get it fixed tonight, but
fortunately, there's a breakfast at The Bike Joint (290A Harbord St.)
tomorrow, which I think I can make it to using only my rear brake,
and I'm sure they'll be able to get me rolling again.</p>
