A few days ago, the city closed [the pedestrian
bridge](http://tinyurl.com/69xc2l) at Summerhill (and MacLennan) in
order to tear it down and replace it.  Since then I’ve been trying to
find a way across the railroad tracks that doesn’t involve taking a
major road.  And I’ve totally failed.  So from now until September
28th, I’ll be biking down Bayview and turning right on Nesbitt before
dispy-doodling my way over to Glen Road.  It’s not my favourite route,
since the traffic on the Bayview Extension is going a fair bit faster
than I’ld like to, and the lane isn’t wide enough to share at those
speeds (and the right-hand side of the lane is brutally cracked and
very difficult to ride on, particularly at 50 km/h), but I still think
it’s better than Mt.  Pleasant.

Looking closer at the map, there _might_ be another route, if I can
get into the path leading South from [David A. Balfour
park](http://tinyurl.com/5vkh8y)…  Yeah, that might be a route to try
on my way home tonight.  I’ll reply with a comment, letting both of
the people who read this know how it was.  ;)
