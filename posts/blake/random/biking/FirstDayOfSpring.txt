<p>Well, okay, so I think it was actually the second day of spring,
but I biked to work on Monday, and today as well, for the first time
in four months.  And it was great!  I made a couple of mistakes, but
that's to be expected, and none of them were particularly
dangerous.</p>

<p>The first mistake I made was to take the back lane to the Belt
Line, over to Oriole.  Both the back lane, and the Belt Line were
solid packed snow, which I have never ridden on before.  It turns out
that as long as you don't want to turn the wheel, riding on packed
snow is a lot like riding on gravel, only wetter.</p>

<p>The second mistake I made was to not wear some sort of protective
pants.  There was a lot of muddy water on the sides of the road, and
it went all up my leg, and onto my coat, and shirt (because my coat
was unzipped cause I was getting warm), and face.  Bleah.  I had a
change of shirt in my pack, but I had to sit with wet legs until my
jeans dried out.  Ah, well, lessons for the future, I suppose.</p>

<p>So, what else?  Surprisingly, given the snow and general attitude
of carefulness I had, I was only 1.5 km/h slower than my previous
average.  And the big-ass hill at Poplar Plains didn't kill me.
Nearly, but not quite.  Since I'm going to be out at Richmond and
Spadina this evening, I might try a different route home.  Up Bathurst
to St. Clair, or something.  Or maybe not.</p>
