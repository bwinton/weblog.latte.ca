I did something new today.  A while ago, I had bought a 10-speed Bianchi
for $30 at a garage sale, with the intention of converting it into a
fixed-gear/single-speed bike to tootle around on.  Well, today, I took it
down to [Bikechain](http://bikechain.utoronto.ca/ "Bikechain at U of T"),
and talked to Steve, who sent me on a merry goose chase picking up various
parts.  Once I had gotten a new wheel, tire, and tube and biked back to
Biekchain, Steve and I put it on the bike, checked the alignment of the
cogs and chain, and then I had to head out to buy a new rear cog, and a
lock wheel…

Sadly, my bike didn’t have a functional rear wheel anymore, so I had to
walk down to [Urbane Cyclist](http://www.ucycle.com/ "My local-ish cycle
shop") to buy the cog and lock.  I ended up with a 52:19 ratio, which is
harder to start on than the gear ratio I use to start, but isn’t too bad,
and doesn’t go as fast as the gear ratio I use to go fast, but again isn’t
too bad.  Given those two things, I figure it’s pretty close to perfect for
my style and level of riding.  When I got the cog and lock ring back to

Bikechain, we put them on the new rear wheel, hooked everything up, ran
into the obligatory problems, fixed them, and finally I was good to go, so
I did!  The first trip I took was a fairly short one, from U of T over to
the [Dark Horse Cafe](

Queen and Spadina.

The second trip was from Queen and Spadina back home, which was a little
longer.  I learned a few things from that trip, but let me start off with
something I didn’t learn.  I had test-ridden a fixed gear bike before, so I
had already been almost bumped off by trying to coast, and this time around
I was expecting it.  So, now on to the things I did learn.

* Stopping is hard.  It’s not that I can’t stop.  I’ve got both brakes and
  pedals.  The problem is stopping with one of the pedals in a decent
  position to start from when I want to start.  The other problem is that I
  really want to coast when I come to the end of a stop, and that totally
  doesn’t work.

    title="I can carry it." alt="My favourite feature." align="right"/></a>

* I can carry it!  (As you can see over on the right there.)  My commuter
  bike is a good ride, and very solid, but damn is it ever heavy,
  especially after I loaded it up with accessories like a rear rack, and
  panniers, and water bottles.  The fixie is simple, clean, and light
  enough to carry all over the place.

* The fixie is slower than my commuter bike.  Not just slower for the
  obvious reason (because I don’t have a higher gear to switch to), but
  it’s also slower for me to start, because I don’t have a lower gear to
  switch to.  It’s really kind of strange, since one of the things I seem
  to be really good at is starting really quickly from a dead stop.  Well,
  that used to be one of the things I was really good at.  On the fixie,
  not so much.

* Even though it’s slower I found that the fixie was a far smoother ride.
  Thinking about it a little more, perhaps because it’s slower.  Since it
  takes me so much longer to stop and start, I found myself slowing down
  earlier to try and conserve as much momentum as I could.

* All in all, I think that the new bike is going to be really good for me.
  It’ll slow me down, and calm me down, which are two things that I think I
  could use.  I can also feel how it’s changing the way I ride, making it
  more smooth, controlled, and thoughtful; keeping my legs moving to give
  me more exercise and stop them from seizing up; teaching me how to lift
  my butt off the seat to go over speed bumps while continuing to pedal.

It’s fun.  A lot of fun.  I’m glad I finally got the conversion done, and
I’m really looking forward to riding it.
