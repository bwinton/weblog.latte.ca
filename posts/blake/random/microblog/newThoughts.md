<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2301433/Weblog/WindowDoor.jpg"
align="right"/>Earlier in my life, I would have looked at the new window in the
door, and thought “Nice!  They must have put that in so that people wouldn’t
slam the door into other people when they opened it.”  But now I find myself
thinking “Nice! They probably put that in so that people wouldn’t slam the door
into other people when they opened it, but it also has the beneficial effect of
letting <span title="women">people</span> know if there’s someone lurking in the
stairwell before they open the door.”  I’m not completely sure what’s changed in
my life (other than I’m exposing myself to more varied viewpoints than I did
when I was younger), but it seems like a positive thing from where I’m standing.

(There are a bunch of things I’ve been thinking recently, and they don’t tend to
fit in 140 characters, so I’m going to try and post more of them here)
