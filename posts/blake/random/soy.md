I have a theory.  (No, it’s not bunnies.)  One of my favourite foods is soy
beans.  I love it both because they’re tasty, and because they’re so
changeable.  I mean, what other substance can be used to make a hard white
solid (tofu), and a viscous black liquid (soy sauce)?  Hey, waitaminnute.
“Soy beans” are oil!  It’s all just different names for petrochemicals!
