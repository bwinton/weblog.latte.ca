<p>So.  I don't really have an excuse this time.  Nothing much has been
going on.  Well, nothing other than the usual stuff.  I did replace the
server, since it was starting to show its age, and it's taken me a little
longer than I thought it might to get everything back up and running.  I
have also been spending my time setting up secure IMAP so that I can check
my home email from both home and work, and not miss stuff when I'm on one
computer or the other.  Really, I'm not even sure why I'm writing, other
than to get back in the habit.  I'm reading a lot of <a
href="http://www.decafbad.com/comments/tech/dynamic_polling_freq_too">
weblogs</a>, and even commenting in some of them.  I suppose that's the
real reason I'm writing this.  To give the backlinks somewhere to point
to.</p>
