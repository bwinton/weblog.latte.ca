<p>I've started writing an installer for my PalmBlosxom conduit, and
associated files.  It's been both easier and harder than I had thought.  It
was way easier to get the installer portion written so far, and I don't see
any particular difficulties cropping up in that part of it.  Sure, there
are still a bunch of things to do, like installing the Palm program for
users who aren't named "bwinton", and learning the strange variant of
Pascal that the installer uses to script things so that I can accomplish
the previous task, but by and large that portion of it is done.  The
uninstall portion of this grand experiment, on the other hand, has been a
royal pain in the ass.  It was fairly easy when all I did was copy some
<img src="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/weblog/InnoSetup.png"
align="right" /> files somewhere and I was done, but when I switched to
registering the conduit with the HotSync application (so that it would run,
instead of just sitting there), I started getting errors, and nothing I've
attempted so far can get rid of them.  I guess I can sort of understand why
it thinks it can't delete the file, but I swear to you, I've unregistered
the dll it thinks it can't delete about four different ways, and
furthermore, as soon as the uninstaller exits I can delete the files either
from the command line, or from the Windows Explorer, without any problem.
Heck, I can even run the installer again, and it will overwrite them
without complaining.  I just can't figure out how to do it
programmatically.  How annoying.</p>

<p>So,if anyone out there has any experience with InnoSetup, and/or
uninstalling Palm Conduits, I'ld appreciate it if you could <a
href="mailto:bwinton%2Bblog@latte.ca">drop me a line</a>, and I'll explain
in more detail what I'm trying to do, and how it's failing, or you could <a
href="http://www.latte.ca/svn/PalmBlosxom/setup.py">check out the source to
my setup program</a> (which generates the .iss file for InnoSetup), and
hopefully point out my misunderstanding from it.</p>

align="right" /><b>Update:</b> I think I'm going to switch to NSIS.  I tried
the innosetup newsgroups, but they weren't as helpful as I would have
hoped.  I'll continue to read them, in the hopes that someone will answer
my question, but I think that I'm not going to get an answer, or at least
not one that I like, so NSIS it is.</p>
