<p>I’ve recently started using <a
href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">bzr</a> as my go-to version control
system, and as a newbie I’ve <a
href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/bzr/BazaarNotes1.html">run
into a couple of small things</a> I’ld like changed.  Fortunately, bzr
is written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, and comes
with an extensive set of unit tests, so it was easy for me to jump
right in and add the feature I wanted.  To be honest, I started off by
writing it up as <a
href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr/+bug/129299">a bug report</a>,
with a trivial patch (by which I mean one without any tests).  The
comments on the bug led me to write up an actual mergable set of
changes (which seems to be called a bundle by the bzr folks), and
submit it for review.  What followed was a few <a href=
"http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.bazaar-ng.general/29306/focus=29306"
>back-and-forths</a> where various people pointed out things I hadn’t
done correctly, or hadn’t really understood, and I fixed them.  As a
result, I think the code in <a href=
"http://bundlebuggy.aaronbentley.com/request/%3C46C303B4.60109%40latte.ca%3E"
>the most recent bundle</a> is pretty good, and is certainly far
better than anything I would have produced on my own.</p>
