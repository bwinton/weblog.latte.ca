I found myself downtown today, with nothing really to do between 3:30
and 6:30.  I suppose I could have headed over to U of T, but it seemed
like sort of a long way to go just to connect to the internet and come
all the way back again.  So instead of making the trek, or wasting two
tokens, I took advantage of the 2 hours of free WiFi that comes with
my Starbucks card, and stayed near Yonge, drinking green tea with a
little honey, and investigating a few bugs for work.  After it runs
out (in another 31 minutes), I think I'm going to pack up, and walk
north to my next appointment, grabbing some dinner on the way.  If I'm
right, that should put me right where I need to be, right when I need
to be there.

Ah, if only everything in my life could fall into place this easily.
(The upgrade to Aquamacs 1.6 that I just did also worked out really
well.  Maybe today is just my day for doing stuff!)
