Okay, one game in particular this time.  One of my favourites from
back in my Palm days.

[Bike Or Die 2](
http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=297288395&mt=8
).<br/>

It’s awesome.  It’s harder than I remember the Palm version being, but
that's probably as much because I'm out of practice as anything else.
After a couple of weeks of playing the beta version, I’m now at the
point where I rarely hit the wrong button, even though they're
on-screen instead of being hard buttons.

Not only is it a great game for what it is, but it’s got a ton of
[user-created levels](http://bike.toyspring.com/levels.php), and an
online [high score board](http://bike.toyspring.com/view.php) (which
I’m [nowhere near](http://bike.toyspring.com/player.php?p=35) the top
of).  The re-playability of this game is stunning.

If you're still undecided, you can read [the
thread](http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=1318) about it
on TouchArcade.  (Yeah, I’ve been answering a bunch of questions over
there.)  There’s also [a video](http://tinyurl.com/bikeordie) showing
gameplay from the beta.

Finally, it only costs $2.99, but I hear it’s going up to $7 after the
introductory period is over.  (I suggested he sell it for $7.99-$9.99,
but he’s apparently a nicer person than I am.)

(No, he’s not paying me for this.  Heck, I didn’t even get an iTunes
gift certificate for all my hard work finding bugs.  I just really
like the game.)
