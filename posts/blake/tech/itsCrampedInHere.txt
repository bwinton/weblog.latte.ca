<p>If anyone out there has been trying to email <a
href="http://arbrown.latte.ca/" >Amy</a> or I, we haven’t gotten it.
While I was home alone with Delphine, I subscribed to a few podcasts
in iTunes, so that we would have a ton of new music to listen to, but
when I went back to work, I forgot to unsubscribe, and as a result
filled up my entire hard drive with music and videos.  This caused a
bunch of things to fail for various reasons, the most notable of which
being that no-one has recieved any email for the past few days.  I can
only hope that the various mail servers around the world will continue
trying to send the messages, but if there’s something urgent that you
really wanted a response to, you might consider re-sending it.</p>
