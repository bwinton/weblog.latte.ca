In my copious free time, I've started helping Rick Price rewrite the
internals of Progect (a project management application for the Palm)
in a more object-oriented manner.  It's an interesting task, getting
to redesign an application with a well defined set of features, and
I'm glad to be able to help, even the little that I can.

As the project progesses, and as I get the free time, I'll add more
of my thoughts on the topic to this category, so that we will have
a record of what the decisions and thought processess were that went
in to the new design.
