I was reading [a presentation](
http://blogs.mathworks.com/images/steve/92/handout_final_icip2006.pdf
) about how to write better software for non-developers, and it said:

I totally agree.  Heck, I even use version control for my personal
one-off projects.  But it got me wondering what people use at their
jobs, so I asked my friends who were on instant messenger, as a straw
poll.  The results were shockingly unanimous.  [Subversion](
http://subversion.tigris.org/ ).  8 for 8.  I regret to say that I’m
not using Subversion at my job, but that may change someday.  In the
meantime, leave a comment, and tell me what you’re using at work or at
home, either to make me feel better, or to rub my nose in it.

*Update*: One person uses Clear Case.  I’ve heard good things about
Clear Case.
