As someone who works on an email client, I’m interested in making
my communications more secure.  So, with the assistance of
[Ludovic](http://perso.hirlimann.net/~ludo/blog/) and
[Gozer](http://gozer.ectoplasm.org/blog/), I got a client certificate that
would allow me to sign and encrypt my messages.  (Check out the envelope
and lock in the image below.)

Most of the time, I’ll probably just sign my messages – after all, that’s
what I’ve set it up to do by default – but it’s nice to know that if
there’s something I need to encrypt, that option is now available to me.
