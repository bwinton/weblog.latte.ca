I’ve been reviewing a patch from [Andreas](http://www.andreasn.se/blog/)
and [Standard8](http://ccgi.standard8.plus.com/blog/) which adds
lightweight theme support (aka personas) to Thunderbird.  It’s so cool that
I couldn’t resist taking a screenshot, and posting it for you all to see!

It looks like there’s a good chance the code will make it in to Thunderbird
3.1 beta 2, so with any luck, soon your Thunderbird will be a pretty as
mine.
