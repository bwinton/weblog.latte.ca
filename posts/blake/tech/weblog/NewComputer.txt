<p>I got a new computer at work on Monday, and so eagerly switched
over all my data to it.  But I didn't install all the various programs
that were on the old machine.  Partly because I had a ton of stuff
installed, and my registry was a complete mess, and partly because I
wasn't working on a lot of the tasks I used to work on, and so didn't
need the tools installed anymore.  But one of the results of this is
that my oh-so-clever palm-memo-to-weblog-entry conduit isn't
installed, and indeed, the components it relies on also aren't
installed, so while I have a perfect chance to write and test an
installer, I haven't even started that yet, so all the weblog posts
I'm writing there are likely going to be delayed by a few days or even
up to a week.</p>

<p>Boy was I ever right there.  It's taken almost three weeks to get
that entry posted.  But now my conduit has an installer, and is
packaged up into a dll, and registers itself and everything, so I
should be able to send it off to other people with just a little more
code in the installer.  I'm kind of pumped.  And apparently other
people are interested in doing something similar, so my little bit of
code might get released in a couple of other places too.  But for now,
you can find the conduit, and the setup script which builds the dll
and the installer <a
href="http://www.latte.ca/svn/PalmBlosxom/">here</a>.  (The code is in
the conduit directory, and the setup.py script is in the root.)</p>
