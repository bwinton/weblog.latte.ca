Iʼm writing a series about switching to Windows, and thought it would be nice
to have a summary post, with links to all the other ones.

Post 0 (The one that kinda kicked it all off): [My problems with the new MacBooks.](https://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/mac/disappointment.html)<br>
Post 1: [Welp, I did it.](https://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/windows/Welp.html)<br>
Post 2: [It’s here!](https://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/windows/weekone.html)

And thatʼs all for now.  Iʼll keep this list updated as I add more posts.
