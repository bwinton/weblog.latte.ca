As I mentioned in a [previous post][disappointment], I wasn‚Äôt really excited by the new MacBooks that were announced this year.  And the more I read the less compelling they seemed‚Ä¶  As I talked with my co-workers, I heard some really good reviews of a couple of models of Windows computers, and since 90% of Firefox‚Äôs users are using Windows it‚Äôs probably not such a bad idea if I use it, too, both to help me understand the problems they‚Äôre running into, and to make sure that the code I‚Äôm writing will work for them.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

So on Friday I bit the bullet and ordered a Dell [XPS 15][dell] (with Touch screen, 32Gb RAM, and a 1Tb SSD) for my latest laptop refresh.  I _think_ that the recent updates to the [Windows Subsystem for Linux][windows] will let me do all the same Unix-y stuff I‚Äôve been doing on the Mac, and if I use the same keyboard and trackpad, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll notice much of a difference, to be honest.

![Dude.  I‚Äôm getting a Dell.](/images/blake/Dell.jpg)

It‚Äôs going to be a few weeks before it arrives, which is nice because it lets me think about all the stuff I‚Äôll need to transfer over, and because it lets [Mike Hoye][hoye] go through all the pain of switching before I do, so I can hopefully avoid the worst pitfalls.  üòâ  There is, of course, a [guide to switching][switching] for Mozilla people, but it‚Äôs pretty out of date.  I‚Äôll probably be updating it as I run into stuff, and hopefully the other people who are also switching will do the same.

So, here‚Äôs the big list of stuff I currently use, and replacements (where I know what they are):

First off, the obvious ones:

* [Slack][slack] ‚áí Slack
* [Firefox][firefox] ‚áí Firefox
* [Twitter][twitter] ‚áí Twitter
* [Crashplan][crashplan] ‚áí Crashplan
* [Chrome][chrome] ‚áí Chrome

Next, the slightly more complicated ones: 

* [iTerm2][iterm] ‚áí [Cmder][cmder]<br>
    Cmder isn‚Äôt the same, but it‚Äôs the best Windows terminal app I‚Äôve found.<br>
    *Update*: I might go with [ConEMU][conemu], the program underlying Cmder, instead. 
* [Safari][safari] ‚áí Also Chrome.  Or maybe [Edge][edge].<br>
    I use Safari mostly for YouTube.  I used to use Chrome for this; maybe I‚Äôll go back, or maybe it‚Äôs time to try a new browser.  I hear Edge has really good battery life while watching video‚Ä¶  üôÇ
* [Atom][atom] ‚áí Atom (or [Visual Studio Code][code]?)<br>
    I‚Äôve heard not-great things about Atom on Windows, so I‚Äôm starting to look into switching to Visual Studio Code.  So far it seems okay‚Ä¶  I do miss the minimap and [Whimsy][atom-whimsy].
* [Dropbox][dropbox] ‚áí Dropbox (or [Google Drive][drive], or [CloudApp][cloudapp]?)<br>
    Mozilla moved to Google Apps for our email, and now we have a big shared space there.  Should we really still be paying for Dropbox Pro accounts for our team?  Maybe not‚Ä¶  Of course, I don‚Äôt think Google Drive uploads screenshots automatically, so maybe I‚Äôll also need to install CloudApp for that?
* [Acorn][acorn] ‚áí [Paint.net][paint]<br>
    Totally not the same, but I think paint.net will do _most_ of the stuff I want.

After that is the software I‚Äôm unsure about alternatives for:

* [LimeChat][limechat]<br>
    I‚Äôve been looking for a while, but still haven‚Äôt found a beautiful IRC client for Windows.  (Please don‚Äôt suggest mIRC, or irssi over ssh‚Ä¶  Anyone who considers those ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù clearly doesn‚Äôt share my aesthetic. üòù)  The closest I‚Äôve found has been [Foo IRC][foo], but I‚Äôm not sure how well it works.  For some reason I had a pinned tab open on [IceChat][icechat]‚Äôs page, but I‚Äôm not a big fan of how it looks‚Ä¶<br>
    *Update*: [IRC Explorer][ircexplorer] looks pretty nice, too‚Ä¶ 
* Mail.app<br>
    I‚Äôm not really enthused with Apple‚Äôs Mail app, but it‚Äôs not terrible.  I hear Microsoft‚Äôs Mail app is pretty similar, so I‚Äôll give it a try.
* [XScope][xscope]<br>
    I don‚Äôt think there _is_ anything like XScope on Windows 10.  I might just have to go back to my Mac for the kinda stuff I use it for‚Ä¶
    *Update*: [PicPick][picpick] looks like it might do some of the stuff XScope does‚Ä¶

And things I just don‚Äôt know about:

* Calendar.app<br>
    I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs _something_ on Windows that does calendaring, but will it connect to my home iCal account?
* [Things][things]<br>
    I don‚Äôt use this a ton these days, but it‚Äôs good for keeping track of what‚Äôs on my plate.  I may just continue to use it on my iPhone‚Ä¶
* [iTunes][itunes]<br>
    I don‚Äôt think [WinAmp][winamp] or iTunes for Windows are really what I‚Äôm looking for here.  I might switch to a combination of [Spotify][spotify] and my iPhone. 
* [Anvil][anvil]<br>
    Do I still need to run folders as websites?  Maybe not so much these days, since I‚Äôm using [webpack][webpack]a lot more, and it comes with a dev server. 
* [Quicksilver][quicksilver]<br>
    I think I could probably use the Cortana search menu for most of what I use Quicksilver for‚Ä¶
* [aText][atext]<br>
    This is another one of those ‚ÄúThere _has_ to be something like this‚Äù apps, but I have no idea what it is.

Suggestions for any of the apps mentioned above would be very appreciated!
