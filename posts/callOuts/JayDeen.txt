<p>From conversations with various people, I know that there are a lot
more of you out there reading this weblog than have commented, and
it's a little strange having this one-sided conversation.  Or, rather,
it's strange when I see you in person, and you already know everything
that's happened to me, so I'm left with little to talk about other
than the weather.  So the third Friday of every month, I'm going to
call one of you silent lurkers out, and ask you to post a reply to
this message letting me know how you're doing, and what's
happening.</p>

<p>So today's victim is Jay Deen.  Jay!  I know you're out there!
Introduce yourself, and tell me what's going on in your life.</p>
