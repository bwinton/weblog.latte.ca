<p>This year, my mother is walking in The Toronto AIDS Walk for Life,
on Sunday September 17, and asked me to post this.<br/>

<blockquote>ACT is an essential &amp; vital organization - I am proud to
work here &amp; I am proud of the work that we do: providing support, HIV
prevention &amp; education services for people living with &amp; at risk for
HIV/AIDS.
<br />
Please pledge what you can &amp; thank you for your support.</blockquote>
