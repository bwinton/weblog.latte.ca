I'm feeling better!  Calloo!  Callay!  I'm still tireder than usual,
but the nausea is gone and I'm actually regaining my interest in food.
Yum!  Food!

We had our first ultrasound a couple of weeks ago, to check for signs
of chromosomal abnormalities, and everything was fine.  The baby is the
right size for this stage, and has a nasal bone.  I don't know about that
last part, but apparently it's good.  We got a picture which I will post
in the <a href="http://pics.latte.ca/">Family Snapshots</a> sometime.  
(Well, probably not for a while because the little computer is futzed,
but that's another story.)

The thing I'm fascinated about with this baby is how little attention
he (we don't know yet so I'm just going to go with "he") needs.  When
Delphine was <em>in utero</em> I spent so much time thinking about 
her and about being pregnant; practically everything I did was informed
by the knowledge that I was a <em>special glowy pregnant women</em>, all
creating life and stuff.  This time I'm busy with other things
like looking after Delphine, keeping house, buying groceries, being
sick and miserable.  I go for hours at a time without even thinking about
being pregnant.  And yet still he grows inside me, taking what he 
needs without making a fuss about it.  He's not going to be this independent
again until he's, like, eighteen.
