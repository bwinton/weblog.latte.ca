This morning Delphine was reading Cordelia one of those 
"Baby Genius" alphabet books with the questions that are
supposed to help you talk to you kid about the picture,
because they assume you're not capable of having a
conversation with your child about a picture in a
book.

So they were on "I", and Cordelia's job was to locate the
"ice skates".  Last time we read the book she only
found the skaters, so Delphine was very pleased when,
this time, she successfully identified the ice skates.  She 
shouted across the room, "Mumma, she found the ice skates this
time!  Last time she only found the skaters!"

Cordelia grinned, bounced up and down on the couch and shouted, "I'm 
smarter than usual!"

I need that on a t-shirt.
