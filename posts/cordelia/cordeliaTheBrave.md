Cordelia, as you know, has been having trouble saying 
goodbye to me when I drop her off at day camp this week.
This morning, again, she cried at breakfast, saying 
she didn't want to go to camp, she wanted to stay with
me. We agreed that I would read her a book at camp
before I left her.

So indeed, we sat down and read a book together at
camp. After the book was over, Cordelia looked at
me and asked, "What now?" She was on the very edge of
tears. I said, "Now we say goodbye and I go home and
you have a nice day at camp." Well, I have never seen
someone so small try so hard not to cry. She squeezed
up her face and said "Okay mama" with a voice full of
tears, but she didn't cry. She was so brave, it just
about broke my heart, and it was all I could do not to
cry myself.

The thing of it is, I know just how she feels. (I almost
always know just how my children feel.) She loves
me *so much* right now, and wants to be near me all the 
time, so it's almost a physical ache when she isn't (at
least unless she's distracted by something else). So 
I will pick them up early tonight and we can all be
together again.
