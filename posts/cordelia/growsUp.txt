On Friday, Cordelia (who is two and eight months) decided she 
was done wearing diapers and wanted to wear underwear.  She has
decided to wear underwear before with mixed results, but 
this time she was really adamant about not wearing diapers,
not even pull-ups.  So she wore underwear, I accompanied her
to the bathroom after meals and her nap, and she went the 
whole day without an accident.  Saturday she had three
accidents but mostly because we weren't on the ball with
taking her to the bathroom at regular intervals.  
Notably, after her first accident, Blake (who didn't
yet understand the depth of her determination to 
wear underwear) tried to put her in a diaper and she
was mortified!  She was furious and miserable until I
explained to her that she could wear underwear and
everyone has accidents.  Since Saturday she hasn't had
any accidents.

On top of that, in Saturday we sold her crib, the one
the people at work bought for Delphine, and now Cordelia
is sleeping in the toddler bed.  She is big!  She 
will get really mad if you call her "little".

So that's it, I don't have any babies any more.
