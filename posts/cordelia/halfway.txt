I'm just over halfway through this pregnancy, and I'm really starting to
feel it.
</p><p>
This morning I put on a dress and realized it was a little tight around
the middle.  My first thought was that I should put on something bigger, 
that I didn't want my belly to look too fat... and then I realized it's
not fat, it's baby.  There's a weird shift that has to happen -- I'm so
used to wanting to conceal and camouflage my belly, but when you're
pregnant you don't have to.  Not to mention that in a week or two it will
be completely impossible!
</p><p>
I'm definitely showing more than I did at this stage last pregnancy,
I guess because I started this pregnancy some thirty pounds lighter.
It's been weird going through my wardrobe to find things that fit; it's
like going backwards in time through my weight loss.  I just grew out
of the shorts I bought last February.  Fortunately it's getting hotter
and it will soon be little summer dress weather.  I'm pretty sure my existing
little summer dresses will work, and if they don't I bet I can get some
cheap at Old Navy or somewhere.  Real maternity wear!  I never had that
before.  
</p><p>
I said above that I'm starting to feel this pregnancy, and I do mean in
the painful way.  I'm having a lot more pelvic and abdominal pain this 
time than did with Delphine.  I get killer cramps in my lower belly whenever
I walk at better than a fast trudge, and I'm feeling more pressure on
my pelvis and cervix than I remember last time.  Also, since the placenta
is posterior this time, I can feel way more kicking, and way earlier,
than I did with Delphine and her anterior placenta.  It feels like the
little guy is practicing capoeira sometimes.  It's nice, though; I like
the kicking.
</p><p>
We had our second ultrasound since I last posted, and we were supposed to
find out the gender of baby number two, but no.  He, or she, was positioned
wrong and the technician couldn't tell.  (I'm not sure how the ultrasound
can see through my belly but not through the baby's leg or whatever.)
So we have to pick two names (which we did, but I'm not telling what they
are) and we have to play the pronoun game for the next four months.  I'm
quite disappointed.  As I said to 
<a href="http://www.littleowl.com/thursday/">Beth</a>, I found that knowing
Delphine was a girl really helped me personify her and feel closer to her
when she was <em>in utero</em>.    On the other hand I'm not hung up on
having one gender or the other this time; some days I feel like I would
love another little girl because Delphine is so great, and then other days
I want a little boy because it would be nice to have one of each.
</p><p>
Tuesday we have a midwife appointment with our primary midwife.  I think
we will set the date for a planned c-section, ten days or so after my due
date.  I know we won't be inducing with oxytocin, so unless I go into
labour all by myself or with gentler methods of induction, it will be a
c-section.  
</p><p>
I'm really torn about the birth thing; on the one hand I would like a 
Caesar because
it's a known evil, and because I am scared of the damage that a vaginal
birth could do to my body, and because a section is safer for the baby.
On the other hand it would be nice to prove to myself that I can deliver
the old-fashioned way -- not that I am tough enough, I know that for sure,
but that my body can generate the right hormones and contract the right
muscles.  My mother never delivered vaginally so I have this weird 
superstitious idea that we, Brown women, just can't do it.  I would like to
disprove that to myself.  We're kind of a genetic dead end, otherwise.
