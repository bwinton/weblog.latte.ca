I am officially done with this pregnancy.  I am full-term, meaning if
the baby was born now that would be cool.  I am also two weeks
from my due date, meaning the baby probably won't be born for ages yet.
I can say with certainty that this baby will be born before the end of
the month, but that is about all I can say.
</p><p>
I am very big, though, and very very tired of being pregnant.  I feel
much more weighed down by this pregnancy than I did with Delphine. I
can't move very fast, I can't bend over easily.  I have to reach over
my belly to change Delphine or to turn on the kitchen tap.  The other day
I gave myself a nasty scrape on the belly when I misjudged my size as I
was brushing by the corner of our new dresser.  I am constantly running
into people with it.
</p><p>
I hope that I feel as small and nimble after the baby comes as I feel
big and cumbersome now.  That would rock.  
</p><p>
I am about out of clothes, too.  I have two pairs of shorts and one
pair of pants that fit and are cool enough for the weather.  To go
with those I have one maternity top.  Until just recently I have been
able to wear some of my longer tops, but now I am too big and
I get a little horizon of belly between my shirt and pants if I try
anything except the maternity top or one of Blake's shirts.  It's a good
thing I don't have anywhere important to be in the next couple of weeks
because I look like a slob.
</p><p>
On the other hand when winter comes I will have a huge wardrobe of
many-sized things to choose from, from the last couple of years of 
constantly changing sizes.

I asked my midwife if there is anything I can do to encourage my body
to actually go into labour this time around.  She suggested evening
primrose oil.  I am to take a capsule three times a day, and apply one,
ahem, topically (to my cervix) at night.  I don't know if it will make
any difference, but it feels good to be doing something.  
</p><p>
I have a pretty
good feeling about having a natural birth this time; this pregnancy
has seemed really... active and it seems like my body is responding more
to the hormones.  I am talking shit, of course, I have no idea whether
I will go into labour this time.  I don't really care either way; it will
be kind of cool to go through labour like a normal person, but on the other
hand having a c-section is sweet because you don't get all stretched out
and incontinent, and you get to miss out on the sweating and vomiting.  
The main reason I want a vaginal birth is so I can come
straight home from the hospital and not have to sleep on their plastic
mattresses and pillows for three days.
