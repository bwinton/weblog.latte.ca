Cordelia's almost four months old.  It seems like longer,
somehow; it seems like she has been with us for a long,
long time.  But it also seems like she's developing 
faster than Delphine did, because we have been down this
route before.  You know how the first time you go on a
journey it seems to take a really long time, because you're
not sure where you're going or when you will get there,
but after that first time the trip seems much shorter?
That's what's happening here.  I'm enjoying this
slightly boring and annoying helpless-baby stage because I know
from experience that it does end some day, so it's easy
to brush off the annoying parts and appreciate the
sweet, squishy, fun parts.  Everyone should have two
children: a practice one and a fun one.

She has an astonishing smile; her cheeks puff out and
her eyes crinkle and she shows all her gums and it's like
you are sharing the most wonderful joke ever.  It makes
you feel like you are the most splendid person she has
ever met; if
she keeps this smile all her life she will break hearts
and win votes left and right.
</p><p>
She still hasn't rolled over the other way more than a
couple of times; she ends up on her belly and stays there
until she gets mad and someone responds to her protests
by rolling her back over.

I tried to put her to bed at bedtime yesterday, but it
didn't work; she didn't sleep.  I think she's still too
young to have developed the two-naps-and-an-overnight-sleep
pattern yet.  She does sleep from eleven until seven, with
us, though.  Sometimes she wakes up in the middle for  
a nurse, but most often not these days.

She's learned how to grab things and stick them in her
mouth -- she loves to chew stuff.  I think she might be
cutting a tooth.  I remember it seemed like forever before
Delphine learned to grab things, and now I'm shocked at
how soon Cordelia can do it.  Right now she is mowing 
down on a rubber elephant chew toy and making satisfied
grunty sighing noises.
