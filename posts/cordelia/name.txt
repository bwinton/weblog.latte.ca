I wrote a bit <a href="http://baby.latte.ca/name.html">about Cordelia's 
name</a>.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out the cheesy Cordelia song.  It might not
be Chris De Burgh, because I couldn't find anything on the 'net.  It
goes "Cordelia!  Let's (something) away the night together, let's
(something) 'til the stars fall down from the sky".  It's really cheesy,
y'all, but I can't find it anywhere on the Internet.  Isn't this what
the Internet is for?
