<p>
Cordelia is going to be nine months old next Tuesday.
She is strong and big, she is charming and funny.
She smiles at people; I will be walking along
with her in the stroller, and someone coming the
other way, someone frowning or lost in thought,
will suddenly start
to smile like they have seen a long-lost friend.
I will start to panic: do I know this person?  Should
I remember their name?  Then I realize they are
been sucked into the vortex of joy that is Cordelia's
smile; it's like they literally can't resist smiling
back.  I hope she always uses her powers for good,
not evil.
</p><p>
Just a couple of days ago she gave up the commando crawling
in favour of the traditional hands-and-knees method, which
seems more efficient and doesn't pick up so much dust. 
But crawling, for Cordelia, is just a method of getting
to something she can use to stand up.  She <em>loves</em>
to stand up, against the couch, against the table, 
even against the wall.  She loves the challenge of 
standing up against the glider ottoman, because it
moves; if you wiggle it back and forth when she's
leaning on it she laughs.  She likes to stand up and
hold on with one hand; she will turn and catch your
eye and grin: "look, mum!"  This morning I was holding
just one hand while she stood up, and I let go and she
stayed upright, although it was the momentary
uprightness of, say, a two-by-four balanced on its
end.  I caught her before she toppled, but while 
she stood there she was grinning like mad.  She is
fearless and a bit of a show-off.
</p><p>
She is eating almost everything except milk and 
the usual things which are verboten until one 
year (eggs, honey, berries).  She eats soft
table food, like cheese and toast with the crusts
cut off and banana, and would really prefer to 
feed herself than be spoon-fed, which means I have
to remember to prepare things which are tidy enough
to be finger food.  She's patient enough, though,
that I can give her a pile of rice on her tray
and she will pick it up, kernel by kernel, and 
stuff it slowly in.
</p><p>
Obviously, her pincer grasp is really good.  She
still has some trouble with losing bits of food
in her fist; if she has some toast or something
clutched in her hand she eats the parts that 
protrude from her grasp, but she doesn't know
yet that she has to open her fist to get at 
what's inside, so she tries to put her whole hand
in her mouth.  Cute; not too smart though.
</p><p>
She's sleeping fairly well (if you consider
going to bed at 6:30 and waking up at 5:00 
to be well).  She naps twice during the day,
alone in her crib just like a TV baby.
I think the early wake-up is because we put
her to bed so early, but I'm not sure how to
shift it later without ballsing up our whole
evening; after Cordelia goes to bed we put
Delphine to bed, which usually takes between
half-an-hour and forty-five minutes, and then
we make dinner.  That puts us making dinner
at seven and usually not eating until eight,
which is about as late as I can stand it.  If
we move the girls' bedtime later, I think we
would have to start having dinner with them,
but that would make either our dinner too early or
their bedtime too late, plus I don't relish
the idea of cooking a proper dinner whilst
supervising the girls.  (I usually cobble
together sometime fairly quick (but still
healthy!) for the girls and then make something
more elaborate for Blake and I.)
</p><p>
So, whatever, I guess we will just leave it
as it is for now and try and go to bed earlier
ourselves so as to deal better with the five 
o' clock reveille.

I'm treating Cordelia completely differently
than I treated Delphine.  This morning after we
had breakfast I left her in the living room while
I did
something in the kitchen (there's a window
from the kitchen to the living room, so I wasn't
entirely out of sight) and she hung around doing
her thing; she stood up, she sat back down, she
pulled books off the shelves, she climbed in
amongst the toys and sat smugly in the midst of
all that plenty like a tiny rajah.  
</p><p>
I would never have done that with Delphine; the
moment I tried to put her down she would have
started crying and I would have picked her up
again.  She was on my hip constantly 
until she was about
fifteen months old.  
If she did play in the living room, 
I would have been hovering behind her,
spotting her as she stood up and holding my 
breath as she sat down.    
</p><p>
I'm not sure, and never will be, how much of
Cordelia's boldness and independence is because 
I'm not hovering over her, and how much I am 
able to not hover because she's so independent.
Similarly I will never know how much of Delphine's
clinginess as a baby was because I never let 
her experience what it was to be alone.  What I do 
know is that Delphine is independent and confident
now, so whatever insecurity she experienced about
being alone, she had the resources to deal with
it when the time came.  
</p><p>
I think the difference 
is that Delphine learned to be on her own at
twenty months, and Cordelia has learned to be on
her own at six months, and I expect that doesn't
amount to a hell of a lot of difference in the
long run.
