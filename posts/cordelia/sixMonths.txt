We took Cordelia for her six month checkup.  She had two
shots (Pentacel and Prevnar, I think; I wrote it down) and
was weighed and measured.  She's 17 lbs and one ounce,
27 inches long and has a head circumference of around 17
inches.  Her growth curve is levelling out a little too rapidly
for our doctor's  liking; the same thing happened with 
Delphine, and it only resolved itself when we started
enforcing a proper sleep schedule.  Cordelia's sleep
is appalling and we are going to have to fix it, but
I don't want to think about it.  There will be crying.

She still smiles a lot, and has taken to laughing.  You
can make her laugh by tickling her, but she also laughs
if you laugh, or if you make a silly face, or if you
put her on your head like a hat.    And she makes me
laugh, with her silly gummy smile and her noisy babbling.

She says "Ba ba bah", and pushes up onto her hands and
knees, and can sit up by herself, although I still like
to lurk nearby when she's sitting
because she's not adept enough to fall over
gracefully, and inevitably smucks her head on the floor.
She's pretty mobile, in a limited kind of way -- she
gets around on her belly, and I'm never sure how much
of the getting around is deliberate and how much is
just incidental to her flailing.
