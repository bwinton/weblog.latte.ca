Cordelia is talking.  She says "Cat".  Okay, she says
"Gah!"  But she says it a lot, when she sees a cat.  "Gah!  Gah gah 
gah!"  And she grins, and claps her hands.  She loves the gahs.
</p><p>
She isn't walking yet, but she stands with aplomb, holding things in
her hands, picking them up, putting them down again, drinking from her
sippy cup while holding something in her other hand and not falling
over, all at the same time.
</p><p>
She has an excellent sense of humour, with a particular taste for
the absurd; silly hats, funny faces, things where they are not 
supposed to be give her pleasure and result in infectious throaty
chuckles.  She also likes it if you run towards her making silly
noises and then nibble her on the neck.  But then, who doesn't? 
Try it on your boss sometime.
</p><p>
She is a bit mischievious; the other day I was on the 
computer while she played and Delphine was napping on the big
bed.  I suddenly noticed that Cordelia was heading into our bedroom
to torment Delphine, so I pushed my chair back and said "uh-uh";
Cordelia immediately squealed with delight and accelerated, her little hands 
slap-slap-slapping on the hardwood.  "Chase me!"  Little monster!
</p><p>
She sleeps quite well, provided she is not disturbed.  I put
her down after a short ritual at about 6:30, and she sleeps until
6:00 the next morning, with maybe one or two breaks to howl a
couple of times, then back to sleep.  She's fairly easily woken, so we
have had to move Delphine's bed into the office/living room.
Poor Delphine goes to bed in the big bed and then when we come to
bed we move her into the office; she has been squeezed out of her
own bedroom altogether.  I guess that's the price you pay
for being the one who sleeps well.  It will be nice when they
each have their own room.
</p><p>
Cordelia doesn't like to be spoon-fed, so I feed her finger food
as much as I can; toast, crackers, cereal, beans, zucchini,
cooked carrot, fruit.  She gets a fairly good variety, most
of which seems to go on the floor.  But she's still nursing
three or more times a day, so I am not too worried about it.
</p><p>
It seems weird that she is almost a year old.  I am glad;
I am looking forward to having two walking, talking, 
going-to-the-bathroom-all-by-themselves kids.  But it still
seems kind of soon, somehow.  This baby is growing up much faster
than  the last one did.
