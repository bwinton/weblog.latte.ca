Surely every mother has experience the too-long nap.  
Or is it just me?
You put her down for a nap, you walk away,
she sleeps.  You hurry to get the things done that you can't
do while she's awake.  You answer email, you take out the
trash, you cut up meat and vegetables for dinner.  You 
still have a few minutes to sit down before she wakes up!
You don't brew tea &mdash; takes too long.  You make instant
coffee with plenty of sugar and sit down with a 
magazine or a book.  
</p><p>
You read a few pages, you look up.  She is still sleeping.
It's been hours.  (Really only an hour and forty minutes.)
She never sleeps this long.  Something is wrong.  She is
surely dead.  You check the clock &mdash; yes, it's really been
almost two hours.  She never sleeps this long!
</p><p>
What do you do?  She is almost surely fine, and sleeping
this long because she needs to sleep.  Do you check on
her, thereby ruining her nap <em>and</em> your 
much-needed quiet time?  But what if she isn't fine?  
What if she's in trouble?  Stopped breathing?  Choked
on a loose button?  Caught up in a blanket?  Fell out
of the crib and knocked herself out?  What do you do?
</p><p>
You decide to let her sleep and try and relax, and 
just as you are getting
to the good bit in your book, she cries.  Your stomach
loosens and you breathe deeper as you go in to lift her
up and hold her close, more beautiful than ever.
