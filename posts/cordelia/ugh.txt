I am bone-weary and grumpy and nauseous and I have no appetite.  At least
I know something is going on, but I'd rather it wasn't so much like the
'flu.

Also I have crampy feelings, but they're not in my uterus, they
feel more like they're in the tendons which tether the uterus.  I think
of it like a big hot-air balloon with guy-wires holding it to my pelvis --
it's the guy wires which seem to be twingeing.   Weird.
