There isn't much going on with Delphine lately.  She's
been busy having colds lately, and that seems to have put a damper on her
development.  She's still cruising, not walking, and babbling, not talking.
She is still very mild-mannered and observant and generally a pleasure to
be around, except when she's miserable about being sick.
</p><p>
We have been reading to her a lot.  I read a book called <em>Babies Need
Books</em> by Dorothy Butler which I can't recommend enough.  Butler is
passionate about books, and she makes a very strong argument as to why and how
babies should be exposed to books at a very young age.
</p><p>
I had given up on the book thing when Delphine was about eight months old
because she didn't seem interested in reading, more in pulling the books
apart and eating them.  The Butler book convinced me to try again, with 
more patience, and it seems to have worked.  One of the things Butler says
is that babies always go through a stage of demolishing books when they're
first exposed to them, whether that be at six months or three years.  You
just have to forge through it until they learn that the content of the
books is more interesting than the flavour of them.
</p><p>
So I tried again, picking a few of the books Butler recommends, and it's
really working.  Reading is now the main activity we do together (since Delphine
doesn't really play with anything yet) and Del seems to enjoy it.  She 
looks at the pages and turns them, sometimes even at the appropriate time, if
it's a book she knows well, like <em>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You 
See?</em>.  She does all the activities in <em>Pat The Bunny</em> except
sniffing the flowers, and I can't say I blame her about that.
</p><p>
One of the things which made reading easier is that I stopped being such
a stickler about how we read together.  I used to think that she had to
be in my lap, but now I'll read to her while she's sitting apart from me
and playing with something else.  It helps that I can read upside down,
so I can point the book at her and read the text from above.
</p><p>
I'm really enjoying all the great books out there.  The Butler book helped
me get a feel for what makes a good baby book, and each week we go to the
library and I'm able to find half-a-dozen books which fit the bill.  I
really like <em>Mr Grumpy's Outing</em> by John Burningham, and 
<em>Peepo!</em> by Janet and Allen Ahlberg, the Mog books, <em>Brown
Bear</em>... there are a million of them.  I just got <em>Hand Hand
Fingers Thumb</em>, a Dr Suess book (although not by Dr Suess) which is
hilarious.  Except the text says "monkey" and the pictures are chimps.   Sigh.
I'll have to clear that up with her when she gets older.
