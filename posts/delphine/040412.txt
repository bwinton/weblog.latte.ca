Just in time for her eleven-month birthday, there is finally something
new to report in the land of Delphine.
</p><p>
First, she is growing at least one, and perhaps two new teeth on top.
It has been five months since the two on the bottom came in, so these
are long-awaited.  They don't seem to be giving her much trouble at
the moment.  They will come in handy in her new practice of taking bites
out of a piece of fruit; last week I shared a plum with her.
</p><p>
Second, yesterday she stood by herself, once when playing with Blake and 
once with
Morgan.  She can walk quite nicely if you hold both her hands, so sometime
soon she'll put it all together and ta-da!  I'll have a toddler.  I
think my prior estimate of walking before she's a year old was optimistic;
I didn't anticipate that her development would plateau for a month or
two as it has.  Darn these non-deterministic babies.
</p><p>
And finally, I gave her egg over the weekend (in chopped liver and fruit
kugel; Passover is a very egg-intensive holiday) and she hasn't yet 
imploded, exploded, broken out in hives or turned into a turnip, so I
think I can assume she's not allergic to eggs.  This is good, because
it means she can have birthday cake next month.  And generally it means
that lots of food that was verboten is now in her repertoire, so it will
make feeding her much easier.
