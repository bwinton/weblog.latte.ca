The other day I went with Delphine's class on a field trip
to the Toronto Botanical Gardens.  I was put in charge of
Delphine; Annie, with long blonde hair in a messy ponytail and
huge blue Cindy Loo Who eyes; and Alyssa, tiny and cheerful
and not particularly inclined to stay with the group.
</p>
<p>
After all the festivities of looking at leaves and planting
garlic cloves and holding compost worms, we all stopped for
a snack.  The children got granola bars, but I had packed myself
an apple because I knew I would be hungry too.  (I eat like a 
little kid, lots of snacks.)  Alyssa asked what kind of apple
it was.
</p>
<p>
"Itâ€™s a Honeycrisp.  I haven't tried them before but I really
like it; it's crispy and juicy and sweet.  We usually get Royal Gala."
</p>
<p>
"We get Honeycrisp," said Alyssa.  "I like them."
</p>
<p>
"We get Golden Russet," said Annie.  I asked if she liked
them and she said she did.  "They're brown and the skin is
kind of rough."
</p>
<p>
I said I would try them next time I bought apples, but
they didn't have any at the grocery store yesterday.
</p>
<p>
Isn't that a weird conversation to have with four and five
year-olds?  I guess that's when you get when you live in
a neighbourhood of foodies.
