A couple of months ago Blake and I were just settling into bed
at around 11:00.  Just as we were dropping off to sleep we heard
the familiar <em>Thud.  Creak.  Thud thud thud thud thud</em> of
Delphine getting out of bed and coming down the hall to our room.
She came in and stood silently on Blake's side of the bed.  
Finally he asked, "What do you need, Delphine?"
</p>
<p>
"Choux pastry!"
</p>
<p>
Silence, then, "Would you like me to tuck you back into bed?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes."
