<h4>Power</h4>
<p>
We installed new compact fluorescents in the bathroom
because the government told us to.  Delphine, of course,
doesn't miss a trick, and she said,
</p><p>
"It's all white!"
</p><p>
"Yeah, we changed the light bulbs."
</p><p>
"Why?"
</p><p>
"These ones use less power."
</p><p>
"Power like the genie [from Aladdin]?"  
</p><p>
Okay, that's not particularly funny, I just love to
watch her learn these new concepts and piece together
the world.  And her perspective makes me think; is 
electric power the same as genie power?  
</p><p>
We're also working on homonyms (not really working
on, I just happened to get a book called <em>Did You
Say Pears?</em> by Arlene Alda out of the library,
and it is about homonyms and homophones, so she's had
them on her mind lately), and the other day she 
said "There are two mangoes!  Mango the colour,
and mango the fruit!"  And I wasn't sure whether
to correct her or not; it's not exactly a homophone
because the two words are obviously related, but I
hate to split hairs with her on something so esoteric.
She's three!
</p>
<h4>Poop</h4>
<p>
Today we had everyone over for dinner.  After we were
all finished eating Delphine decided she had to use
the facilities, which are unfortunately right next
to the dining area, and she still does all her business
with the door open.  So she did her thing, which
of course turned out to be pretty noisy, and we all
laughed.
</p><p>
"Are you laughing at me?  I just farted!"
</p><p>
"Farts are funny," I said, which provoked a short
discussion about why it's not funny when Zaida farts.
I said we're laughing on the inside.
</p><p>
Then Delphine said "I have lots of farts.  I'm 
full of farts!"
</p><p>
And then she got off the toilet and assumed the
"please wipe my bum" position so I had to excuse myself
and take care of her business while trying not to 
pee myself laughing.  Ah, parenthood.
