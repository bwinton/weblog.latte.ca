Yesterday I was talking to Auntie Morgan on the telephone.
Delphine wanted to talk to her so I put her on.  They talked
for a while and then Delphine told Morgan about her new
balloon.
</p><p>
"It's over there," she pointed.  "I will show it to you."
</p><p>
Then she spent some time trying to  figure out how to get
the phone out of the kitchen (where it is attached to the
wall) into the living room where her balloon was.  Finally
I asked her if she would like me to hold the phone for her
while she went to get her balloon.
</p><p>
"Yeah, you hold it.  Don't talk though!  Don't talk!
Just hold it!"
</p><p>
So Morgan and I had a secret whispered conversation while
Delphine went to retrieve her balloon.  Then after she had
"shown" the balloon to Morgan she started playing with it
and got distracted from her telephone conversation.  After
I said "Don't forget to talk to Auntie Morgan!" a couple
of times, Morgan said "Should we say 'good-bye' now?" and
Delphine said "Bye." and handed the phone back to me.
She's a charmer, that one.

She just came running out of the bedroom, said "You're
not my friend, Cordelia," and ran back in.
