Delphine and Cordelia have really started fighting in
earnest, sibling-style, lately.  Previously they got in
little tiffs about who should play with which toy, or
who should be on what side of the bath — sensible
stuff — but now they just bicker for the sake of it.
The other day I heard this:
</p>

<p>
Delphine: "You're a pest!  You're Ramona!"<br/>
Cordelia: "No I not Ramona!  I not in a book!"<br/>
Delphine: "Yes you are!"<br/>
Cordelia: "This in't a book!"
</p>

<p>
But later that same day Delphine retreated to her
room for half an hour and emerged with four pages
stapled together with a drawing of a princess to
colour in, some dotted lines to trace over and
letters to copy.  It was an activity book for
Cordelia, and on the first page she titled it
"UORVAREFRSTBOKK".  ("Your Very First Book")  She
spent all that time and thought to do something 
nice for her sister.  That's how I know she really
loves her, even though she is a pest.

Delphine's writing is progressing (although as
you can see she doesn't know about spaces 
between words, internal vowels are sporadic, and
she prefers ALL CAPS) and she loves 
to write things down.  The trend now is to let 
little kids just write things down anyhow and 
work on spelling later; it's called inventive
spelling and for me it mainly reinforces how
difficult and random the English language is.

Yesterday Delphine decided she wanted to write
down some girl names that she liked, in case she
has a girl baby.  Here is what she came up with:

<p>
<u>GORLS</u> (That's the title.)<br/>
GABREELA (Gabriella)<br/>
MEGI<del>M</del>N (Megan)<br/>
MEG<br/>
LVEA (Livia)<br/>
HEG (Hedge — I don't know why this is on her list)<br/>
LENDA (Linda)
