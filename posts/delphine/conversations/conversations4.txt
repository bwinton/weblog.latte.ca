I went to pick her up after her nap.  She seemed quite
pleased, and said:
</p><p>
"I yike dis."
</p><p>
She rolled something around in her mouth and said:
</p><p>
"I yike dis fing in my mouf."
</p><p>
"What do you have in your mouth?"
</p><p>
"A booger."
</p><p>
Ah.  A booger.  "Where did you get the booger?"
</p><p>
"I got it out of my nose."

My friend Kathryn broke her ankle, and we went to visit her
over the Christmas holiday.  Yesterday Delphine said, "My ankle hurts."
</p><p>
"Your ankle hurts?"
</p><p>
"Yeah.  I was walking, and I slipped."  
</p><p>
That's what we told her happened  to Kathryn, so I said, "Oh,
like Kathryn!"
</p><p>
"Yeah, yike Kafryn.  Yike my beautiful Kafryn."
</p><p>
Okay then.  You want me to get her number, maybe set up a date?

Delphine talking to Morgan: "Daddy can hold two girlies!  He 
is big and strong.  Yike Zaida.  Yike your Erik."
