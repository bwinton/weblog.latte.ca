<p>
This morning Delphine slept late, and she was in an exceptionally chatty
mood when she woke up.  She came into bed with farting on the mind,
and asked,
</p><p>
"Who farted?"
</p><p>
"I don't know," I said, "who?"
</p><p>
"I think Zaida farted."
</p><p>
"Yeah?"
</p><p>
"Zaida has a big white moustache.  And hair.  His hair
match his moustache."  A pause.  "Zaida is very old."
