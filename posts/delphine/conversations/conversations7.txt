<p>
One the way home from daycare I stopped off at the LCBO 
to buy beer because it was just that hot.  
</p><p>
"Erik likes this," said Delphine as we walked through
the store.  "Erik likes these", she said, as we walked
into the beer section.
</p><p>
"Mummy likes these too, and Auntie Morgan," I said.
</p><p>
"No!  Just Erik.  What is this called?"
</p><p>
"It's called beer."
</p><p>
"Oh.  I don't drink beer.  I'm too little."
</p><p>
"That's right."
</p><p>
"When I am older I will drink beer.  But not now.
I am still young."
</p><p>
It's good to have something to look forward to.
