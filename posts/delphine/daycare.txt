Delphine had her first real daycare experience yesterday; I left her for
an hour and a half in the morning, went back for a while and then left her
for another hour and a half in the afternoon.  Apparently in the morning
she was pretty sad but in the afternoon she was okay.    She cried when
I can to pick her up, and she wanted to leave right away ("Okay, let's
go!") but we hung out for a few minutes and she was soon back to playing
while I watched.
</p><p>
I was pretty miserable
without her, though; I hate the idea of leaving her all alone even though
I know she's far from alone.  She's learning how to be a person all by
herself and how to be with people who aren't family, and by definition
she has to do it by herself, but I still wish I could be there with her.
It's paradoxical, like teaching her to sleep by herself; she has to be
by herself to do it, but I want to be there.
</p><p>
I, on the other hand, am wondering what the hell I was thinking.  I'll
be making $15 an hour, of which I imagine I will be taking home about $10.
That means I have to work for six hours to pay for daycare, leaving me
$20 to take home.  If, hypothetically (and obviously this won't happen)
I take the subway for four bucks, have lunch for eight, and get a coffee
for two, that will leave me with $6.  Who the hell works a full day for
three shiny toonies? 
</p><p>
Add to that the fact that I still have to cram a grocery trip, seven loads
of laundry, baking two loaves of bread, vacuuming and a trip to the
library into the half-week I have left makes me wonder if this wasn't
a very stupid idea.  Not to mention how the hell do people cook a decent
dinner when they get home so late?
</p><p>
But I can't back out now, too many people are counting on me.  And I
guess the idea behind this was to build up hours so I can get maternity
benefits, not specifically to make money now.  
And I think daycare will be good for Delphine, between the
physical activity and the crafts and the structured days, all things I
am not so great with.  I guess it will work out.
