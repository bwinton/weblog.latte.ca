Today was Delphine's last day of being five, and also the day
of her birthday party. There almost was no party; Delphine has
been laid low with some kind of puking and fatigue disease.
She stayed home from school on Friday and I warned the
party invitees that the party may be off. This morning
Delphine woke up feeling better, so I made a bunch of calls to
summon the troops.  One of the kids had already changed her 
plans, so in fact
of Delphine's original list of six, only three children
were able to come. (Two of her list had previously declined.)

The weather wasn't conducive to small-child-partying. There
were intermittent thunderstorms all day, which meant all our
fun outside games were transferred inside, smaller and darker
and less fun. 

I don't know if the children enjoyed themselves; they 
certainly aren't shy about letting you know when they're
not having fun, when they don't like a game, when they 
don't like any of the food, when someone isn't playing the
way they want you to, or indeed when anything isn't rocking
their little worlds. But nobody screamed and demanded to be
sent home, so I suppose that's a win. You might guess
I didn't particularly enjoy hosting today's party.

Delphine didn't have a great day either. It started
with still being a little bit sick, complicated by bad
weather, missing friends, and a party that didn't go as
smoothly as she wanted it to - Cordelia didn't play 
the games properly and nobody listened to her. By this 
afternoon she didn't
like any of her presents and nobody loved her, and by 7:15 pm
she was begging to go to bed. Tomorrow is her birthday
and I hope it goes better.

(It's now 9:47 pm, and Delphine is crying in her room. Blake
went upstairs to comfort her, and I just heard her say, 
"I want chicken!" Turns out she wanted Chicken her buddy,
not chicken the food.)
