Delphine is not a baby any more.  She is a full-on little girl.  It 
happened over the last couple of weeks, but we just realized it today
at breakfast when we were sitting at the dining table.  Delphine was
sitting on a booster on one of the dining chairs, eating her eggs and
bacon and waffles with a fork, and drinking water out of a huge 20 oz
glass.  She's no baby.  Blake and I were a little sad.
</p><p>
Good thing we're working on another one.
</p><p>
She is linking words together now; she started couple of weeks ago
with "Baba hot tea" and now she's all about the sentence fragments.
She says "Hello Thomas" (ah-no Momis) and "Daddy book" (all books are
Daddy's book, I don't know how that works) and "boobie nap" (a boobie
nap is when she nurses and naps at the same time) and lots of other
things.  Today she added a possessive "s", "Morgan's boots".  And she's
being doing plural s's for a couple of days.  When we put her down to
bed she says "two man-kents" (blankets); I must have said that one day
and it stuck with her.
</p><p>
We got her a pair of Sorel winter boots, the classic winter boot 
(unfortunately not Canadian) and a new navy blue snowsuit, so she is
all kitted out for the winter.  Later this week if it warms up we're
going to go to the park and play in the snow.
</p><p>
I finally got her into a daycare starting in mid-January; I'm sharing
a full-time spot with a friend so we'll each have two days a week plus
alternate Wednesdays, or whatever we decide.  I'm pretty excited about
it; I think it's a really good time for her.  I think she'll enjoy all
the people and activities and stimulation, and hopefully it will take
some of the pressure off me to provide Activities and Crafts* and 
Edifying Experiences, and let me just hang out with my girl in the time
we have together.
</p><p>
* I've read a few different "activities to do with your toddler"-type
books and articles, and all of them included a multiple-page list of 
crafting supplies you will "need" in order to raise your child 
effectively.  I have a two-bedroom condo, I barely have room to store
pens.  Give me a break.
</p><p>
The more I learn about daycares the more comfortable I am sending Delphine
to one.  There really isn't anything scary or horrible about the kinds of
daycares we have in Ontario, which are basically pre-pre-schools run and
staffed by degreed Early Childhood Educators.  They have planned activities
which cover all kinds of different development and all kinds of subject
matters.  I think Delphine will thrive in that environment; she's so smart
and curious and loves new experiences. 
</p><p>
I do wonder how she will deal with the other kids.  Of the two other
toddlers she hangs out with she is by far the most passive; if she gets
into a tug-of-war over a toy she will always give in first and cry.
I am curious to see what kind of tactics she will develop to deal with 
the other children.
