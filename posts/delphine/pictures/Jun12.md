I’ve recently installed a new version of Sketches, and today Delphine
asked if we could draw another picture.  So we did.  Then we emailed
it to Amy, and I got Delphine to tell me what letters to write for her
sentence.  (I also told her about putting a space between each word,
which is something that Ms. Hollister said that we could tell her
about if we wanted.)

The sentence was “Ths is a heis on a hil wth to bsis.”, which I’m sure
you can all read as “This is a house on a hill with two bushes.”.
