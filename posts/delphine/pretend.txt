Delphine is seldom Delphine.  Sometimes she's Pooh, and I'm
Piglet.  Sometimes she's the mummy, and I'm the baby.
Sometimes she's Ursa, and I'm Delphine.  Sometimes I am
Stella and she's Sam, and sometimes I am Sam and she's
Stella.  Lately, she has been Corduroy and I have been
Lisa.

She has a tremendous imagination.  Today she pretended
a calendar on the wall was a baby, and she was rocking
it to sleep.  Any pair of things where one is bigger
than the other become a mummy and baby: "Mummy spoon, 
mummy spoon, I am sad!  Want up mummy spoon!"  And
she holds the baby spoon approximately halfway up the
mummy spoon.

Yesterday she and Blake were playing with balls, and
they held them on their heads and Delphine said
"Look Mummy!  We got two heads!"

It's so much fun being along for the ride with her
amazing little brain.
