<h4>Words Delphine Says</h4>
<p>
Cat.  Duck.  Ball.  Daddy.  Mummy.  (She doesn't quite know who is which, though.)
Baby.  No.  (Sometimes polysyllabically, Aussie-style.)  Bubby (for
my chestal region and the pleasures thereof.)  Down, as a nice counterpoint to
"up!".  She sometimes says "Up please".  Other times she just says
"Up UP!"
</p>

<h4>Fifteen Month Stats, Finally</h4>
<p>
She was 22 lbs 11 oz, and 30.7 inches, meaning she had gained 11 oz and .7 inches
since her one-year checkup.  That's not very much; she's slid from the 95th percentile
at birth to the 50th now.  Yeah, I know they're not supposed
to gain much in the second year, but more than that.    Anyway, she seems bigger now
so maybe she has had that growth spurt we've all been waiting for.  Her next checkup
is November 17th.

<h4>Sleeping, Eating, Teeth, Hair</h4>

She's still sleeping in the crib.  The last couple of nights have been great, the
couple before that not so good, and so on.  It's a process.  I'm surprised by how
she has taken to it, though.  After we go through our bedtime routine (diaper, jammies,
teeth, nurse) she veritably lunges for the crib face-down, tucks all her limbs underneath
her and goes right to sleep.
</p><p>
She has just started cutting her canines.  Once they are in each type of tooth --
incisors, molars and canines -- will be represented, meaning she can eat anything
we can eat.  I don't buy much food especially for her anymore, apart from crackers
and high-fat dairy products.  She still loves tomatoes more than anything, and I don't
think there's anything that she particularly dislikes, although she's not very
interested in most things.  Perhaps I am nursing her too much?  I didn't think that
was possible, but then I have only read the hippie attachment parenting books
on the subject.

I cut her hair for the first time yesterday -- the front is still really short, so
I trimmed the sides and back so it doesn't look so mulletty.  It's much better now,
and she kind of looks older.  I didn't do a fantastic job, technically; the sides
look a bit hacked at, and there are a couple of wisps at the back that I couldn't
get because she kept moving away, but her hair is haphazard enough in general that
my clumsy efforts don't stand out.

<h4>More</h4>
<p>
All these dry factoids are inadequate to express what Delphine's like, how she is.
She's so interesting, funny, clever.  She loves to be read to, and to go for walks.
She is fascinated by plants.  She can stroke the cats gently.  She dances to music,
bouncing and turning around and rocking from foot to foot.  She likes to clean up,
walking around the house with a rag wiping things, and "sweeping up" with a whisk
brush (really she finds the neat piles of stuff that I have swept, and flings them
around with her brush).  She loves to say no: "Nnnn-aaaa-oooo!"  She is a hundred
times more interesting now than when she was a baby, and I love to be with her.  I
miss her when she is sleeping or out with her auntie or grandparents.  She is both
lovely, and amazing, and I tell her so all the time.
