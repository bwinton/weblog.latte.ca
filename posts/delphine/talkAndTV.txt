Delphine says "Do you remember when I was three (free) but
not even three and a half and we lived in the old house..."
Or, while we were in the middle of the reno, "...and we 
were not renovating"  Ah, the good old days when we were not
renovating.
</p>
<p>
We finally managed to drag the electric piano upstairs and
the girls love it; Cordelia just bashes away but Delphine
would really like to play properly.  I am going to see if
there are decent piano lessons available for four-year-olds.
In the meantime, though, she calls the high notes "light"
and the low notes "dark"; synaesthesia or just good sense?

<h4>Delphine Watches TV</h4>
<p>
Sometime in the last six months, Delphine has gone from a 
little kid who almost never watches TV to a little kid who
habitually watches one or two shows every day.  It started
after we moved, when the house was littered with choking
hazards, falling hazards, breaking hazards and general
getting in the way hazards and the TV was a handy way
of keeping Delphine happy in one place.  Since then we
just haven't seemed to phase it out, and now I let her
watch a couple of shows when Cordelia is napping.
</p>
<p>
Delphine doesn't like anything with any kind of, how to
put this... conflict.  She is still very easily scared
so we stick with shows where the conflict is mainly 
inter-personal or internal -- Max can't find his monster
mask; Franklin needs help tying knots.    Even still, 
she hides her head in the couch for the scary bits of 
<em>Franklin and the Thunderstorm</em>.
</p>
<p>
So we watch <em>Franklin</em> (love that theme music!),
<em>Max and Ruby</em> (but it's just not the same now that
Samantha Morton isn't voicing Ruby), <em>Timothy Goes To
School</em>, and of course <em>Charlie and Lola</em>, which
I love because it's so very very English and I'm a big ol'
Anglophile.  If you can be a -phile of what you are, anyway.
