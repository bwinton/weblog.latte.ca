It's not all puppies and roses with Delphine.  She's
testing us all the time lately, on matters both trivial and
not.  This morning we wanted her to be quiet so she
wouldn't wake up Cordelia, and instead she screamed
"I don't want to be quiet!"  Cordelia woke up, I got
really mad at Delphine.  So I pinched her.
</p><p>
I don't want to admit that, because some people think
I'm such a great mother, but I have to be honest.
There are people who read this blog who have
crazy kids (like mine), who have trouble handling 
their anger, 
who have made parenting mistakes, and to sit here
and act like Delphine is always good and I am
always cool and perfect
would be a disservice to them and to the whole
concept of talking about parenting.  
</p><p>
I wasn't cool &#8212; I
was really really angry because it was 5:30 in the
morning and I wanted Cordelia to stay asleep and
Delphine picked that stupid time to see if we
were serious about the "be quiet" thing.
</p><p>
I didn't pinch her all that hard, but I wanted to.
This isn't the first time I have wanted to hurt her
because I was angry, but it's the first time I ever
did it.  I hope it's the last.  I have a horrible 
temper and Delphine is trying it more and more
lately.  Hopefully this testing phase will pass
quickly, but of course there will be other
irritating phases in the future.  As is always 
the case on all those parenting shows, the problem
that needs to be fixed is me.
</p><p>
Anyway, now Delphine is happily reading books
to her Daddy, none the worse for her experience.
I just hope I can keep the ratio of good 
parenting to appalling mistakes high enough that
she is always resilient enough to bounce back
so easily from my bad behaviour.
