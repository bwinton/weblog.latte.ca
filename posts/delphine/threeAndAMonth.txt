Today Delphine is at daycare.  Blake is in Montreal on 
business so to lighten my load, my in-laws took 
Delphine for a sleep-over last night.  She was
really excited to go:  "Can I sleep in the crib?"
They have a Pack n' Play and Delphine still loves
to sleep in it even though she can't stretch out
in it any more.  This afternoon I will go and pick
her up from daycare at around 4:30; when I get there
Cordelia will be mobbed by all the little children
who are not lucky enough to have a baby sister, and
Delphine will play it cool, walking away from me
and finding something else to do.  After a few
minutes she will come back and show me what she
is doing, and then she will say "Wanna go home."
And we will walk around the corner and down the
block, stopping to examine an ant or some broken
glass, and to step up onto the entrance at Pizza
Pizza.

She's good company these days.  She is hardly
ever arbitrarily defiant any more; mostly she
is compliant and friendly, and if she isn't it's
because she's tired or hungry or she wants to
wrest your attention away from Cordelia.
</p><p>
I'm feeling a little sad lately because we
don't read as much as we used to, because of 
Cordelia.  I used to literally sit and read to
her for an hour or more, but Cordelia isn't 
old enough to sit and be read to yet, so she
comes and crawls all over us and pulls the book
away and is generally a nuisance.  I try and read
to Delphine while Cordelia is napping, but I
also have to fit in sundry housework in the 
hour she's asleep, so we usually don't get 
through more than a couple of books.  I hope
once Cordelia is old enough to be read to
properly we can go back to our old habits.
</p><p>
Cordelia is, unfortunately for Delphine, at that
Godzilla stage where she lumbers around the
house destroying things because that is all
she is capable of; she pulls books off shelves
and bends them and mouths them, she overturns 
towers of blocks and deranges puzzles.  As
an adult I can accept this, knowing it is
temporary, and I can move my precious things
to high places, but Delphine can't.  She's 
stuck down there at Cordelia's level and
she doesn't appreciate my "she's just a baby"
excuses.  I wish Delphine had her own room
where she could keep things, but for now she
is just going to have to suck it up.  I suppose
it will build character.  In a way it's nice
that she gets to go to daycare and be free
of the barbarian horde for a few hours.
</p><p>
Other than those unfortunate incidents, 
Delphine gets along quite well with Cordelia.
She knows that you are not supposed to snatch
toys from her, that if she has something you
want you have to find something else for her
to play with in exchange.  She shares her
food with Cordelia and she knows to ask what
babies can have.  She knows to be quiet when
Cordelia is sleeping.  She likes to make
Cordelia laugh.  She is a good big sister.

They have this chart of verbal development
which tell you when you should worry -- say,
if your three-year-old isn't forming sentences
or if your one-and-a-half-year-old doesn't
say five words or something.  The chart goes
up to age five and apparently if Delphine were
five, we wouldn't need to worry about her verbal
development.  She knows colours, she asks the
meaning of words, she counts to ten, she knows
all the nursery rhymes.  She knows nursery
rhymes you haven't even heard of.  
</p><p>
She's starting to show signs of literacy;
she knows that letters are associated with 
sounds, and she has started asking "what does
that say" when we read books.  She can recognize
some words, although I am still not sure if it
is recognition of the word or just remembering
what that particular instance of that particular
word is.  I mean, we were reading an Eric Carle
book and I pointed to the word "Eric" and asked
her what it was.  She got it right, but did she
recognize the word "Eric" or did she remember it
was "Eric" from the last time we read the same
book?  Either way it's a step in the right
direction; all we need to do now is teach her
the <em>correct</em> spelling for "Erik".
</p><p>
I feel like I am being too braggy and I should try
and think of something bad to say about Delphine,
but I am not trying to brag.  I just really
like her.
