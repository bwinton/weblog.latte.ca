Delphine just turned three.  We went out to visit my parents
in Saskatchewan for her birthday, and they furnished a suitable
amount of cake, candles, fancy decorations and presents to
satisfy her little self.  We had a nice time.

We went to the doctor this morning for Delphine's three year
checkup.  She was a little nervous, but it turned out she
didn't get any shots, so that wasn't so bad.  She lay down
on the examination table properly, opened her mouth nice 
and wide,
and let the doctor check out all her vitals.  Generally she
is doing fine, although a little small for her age -- 
around the 40th percentile for height and a little lower 
for weight.  We're not concerned about it because she 
eats well, but we'll do the measurements again at 
3 and a half, just in case there is something up so 
we can catch it early.

And Cordelia is awake.  Thus ends the blogging for this
month...
