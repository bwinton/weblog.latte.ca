When I went to pick Delphine up from school this afternoon,
she burst into tears as soon as she saw me.  One of the
other moms pointed her out to me; "Isn't that yours
crying up there?"  The teacher,
a substitute, said "She just started crying, I don't know
what happened!"  
</p>
<p>
I asked Delphine, "Did something happen?"  She shook her
head.  "Did someone do something?"  No.  "Did you lose 
something?"  No.  "Did you hurt yourself?"  No.  "Are
you going to tell me why you're crying?"  No.  So I
didn't press the issue, and we started walking home.  
After we had said goodbye to Delphine's friend and
walked a few more steps, Delphine said "There was
a different teacher, and Mrs Hollister said it was
going to be Mrs Green or Mrs Turk and it wasn't any
of them!  And we had music in the gym, not in music!
Everything was too different!"  And she sobbed.  She
went on to detail further how things were different 
(she had lunch at a friend's house instead of home,
and the gym was all set up for a concert, not like
normal).  She was really upset!  I remember hating 
things to be different when I was a kid, so my heart
went out to her.  Once we got home we read a book and
cuddled on the couch, and she seems to feel better
now.

I hope things aren't so different tomorrow!
