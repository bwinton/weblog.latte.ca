I'm too tired to write a coherent narrative today, so here are some
random notes about Delphine.
</p><p>
Today she counted to five.
Her favourite book (today) is <em>Madeline's Rescue</em>.  She also likes
<em>Freight Train</em> by Donald Crews.
</p><p>
I was trying to get her to eat supper tonight, and she didn't want
any.  She pushed it toward me and said "Eat it, Mummy".  Her first
pronoun and her first sentence.
</p><p>
A few days ago Delphine went over to Baba's house with Morgan, and
went to look for cheese in the fridge; Baba always has cheese in
the fridge, but this time she didn't.  Today we mentioned cheese
and Delphine said "cheese ... all gone ... Baba ... house".  She has
all these thoughts, and it's such a pleasure to finally hear them.

<h4>Daycare</h4>
<p>
She started daycare this week; I am sharing a full-time spot with a
friend.  So far I have stayed with her while she gets used to it, but
I think tomorrow I'll try and leave her there and see how she takes
to it.  I think she will be fine.
</p><p>
It has been fun staying at daycare with her; I thought the daycare 
ladies (I guess there's a better name for them) might be annoyed to have
me there, but they honestly didn't seem to mind.  Actually the
two days I have been there so far they have been short-staffed, so I
was able to help a little, reading to the kids and swabbing snotty
noses (approximately 40% of noses are snotty at any given time) and 
tidying up and so on.  The kids are lovely.  They're between eighteen
months and two-and-a-half, toddling and pretending and interested and
cuddly.  None of them are horrible, although one of them is very 
spirited and tends to do whatever comes to mind, but he's also the
youngest.
</p><p>
Once upon a time someone (someone with very few social skills) tried
to give me a hard time for giving Delphine a "weird" name.  The other
children in Delphine's daycare are Antonio, Ethan, Claire-Marie, Ursa,
Beniam, Eloi, and Laetitia (there are a couple more but I didn't meet
them).  It's not like she's ever going to be in a class full of 
Jennifers and Sarahs.
