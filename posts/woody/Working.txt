<p>I got a job.  I start tomorrow.  Network and Systems administration for
a small software development shop.  Sound familiar anyone?  Funny enough,
much like my interview with my previous employer, I was welcomed to the
interview for this job by a big dog.  I like that.</p>

<p>In other related, but less humble news, I have actually worked a couple
of days for these people already.  They brought me in for a 2 day trial.
There was another fellow due to come in for 2 days after me, but once I'd
been there for a day and a half, they called the other guy and told him not
to bother coming in.  The position has been filled.  Woah.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have a web design contract I have to round out for a client
by 7 this eve, so I think I should step off and be productive.</p>
