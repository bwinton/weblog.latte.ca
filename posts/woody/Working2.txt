<p>I had my days mixed up last week.  All day Tuesday, I thought it was
Wednesday.  All day Wednesday, I thought it was Thursday.  Needless to say,
my meeting was supposed to be Thursday night and Friday was my first day of
work.  Good thing, too.  I got a free day out of the deal.  Also, now that
I have a 9-5, Monday to Friday job, I might even be able to keep track of
what day of the week it is!
