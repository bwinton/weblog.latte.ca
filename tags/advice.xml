There will come a day, probably when your baby is around five
or six months, that she will no longer be amused by brightly
coloured or pastel coloured, hard or squishy baby toys.  No
matter how novel they are, your baby will somehow be able to
detect that they are intended for her, and as such she will
turn her little baby nose up at them, especially when you
particularly want her to be quietly absorbed in something,
like when you're at a restaurant or on a plane.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It is at those times that you will have to resort to baby
toys that aren't.  Fortunately there are plenty of them,
and anyone who has had a baby for a while has a few tricks
up their sleeve.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;In Your Bag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Keys, of course, are classic.  They jingle, there are
lots of different and interesting textures, they are
cold and hard on itchy teething gums, and it doesn't 
matter if you slobber all over them.  Provided you
clean them off before you give them to the baby.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Credit cards (or perhaps more sensibly, loyalty cards
or something else you can easily replace) are nice too.
They're a good size and weight to hold on to, and they have those
interesting embossed letters on them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Water bottles -- for some reason babies love water 
bottles.  Both Cordelia and Delphine played with them
for hours!  Well, minutes, which are like hours in 
baby years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;In Your Kitchen&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The kitchen is packed with interesting things to chew
on.  Wooden spoons are great -- you hardly ever see
baby toys made of wood, so it's probably a new and
exciting texture for your baby.  Teaspoons are nice,
too -- smooth and hard and shiny.  Delphine really 
liked a silicone spatula, and Cordelia amused herself for
half-an-hour the other day with a bright red silicone
basting brush.  It must have felt so interesting in
her mouth, all those little soft silicone bristles.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Measuring cups and small bowls are fun too, especially
when you drop them on the floor and they make a
spectacular rang-tang-tanging noise.  (Unless you
have a baby who startles easily, in which case she
will probably scare herself and cry and cry.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I had a surprise hit the other day with one of those
mesh bags you wash your bras in -- Cordelia sucked it,
she chewed it, she stuffed it in her mouth and pulled
it out again (it was like a magic trick), she found
the label and chewed on that.  No end of amusement!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;In Your Living Room&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Okay, there's not much in here -- you don't want
your kid playing with your CDs or chewing your books.
But there is one thing that every baby covets: the
remote control.  And don't try and buy one of those
brightly coloured fake-o toy remotes, either, your
kid is too smart for that.  She wants the real thing!
The only hope is to find an old remote that doesn't
work any more, take out the batteries and make sure
none of the bits are going to come off, and let her
have it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;In Your Bedroom&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hairbrushes and combs keep Cordelia amused while I
change her diaper, and sometimes when I'm desperate
I give her a lotion bottle for a few moments (after
checking that the lid is secure.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Fabric is fun for babies; I have had success with
a lovely pair of brightly printed silk boxer shorts
(sorry Blake).  Silk is especially good for a baby
who is just beginning to grip, because it is incredibly
light and easy to get a grip on.  Cordelia 
seems to enjoy the texture of a wet or dry facecloth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr width="40%"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The bottom line is, don't feel that you have to limit
your baby to baby toys.  You can give her any old thing
provided it's reasonably clean, and that it's not going to
break up into chokeable or sharp pieces. Use your
common sense, and you and your baby will be quietly
amused for, well, minutes.

It's not a bad idea to go to the 
&lt;a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpsclist.asp"&gt;CSPC&lt;/a&gt; website and sign
up for their email notifications of product recalls.  Right now I
am obsessively staring at the page about  bracelets that came 
free with Reebok sneakers.  They have high lead content and a
four-year-old girl died from swallowing part of one.  I mean,
can you fucking &lt;em&gt;imagine&lt;/em&gt;?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Incidentally there are lots of recalls for cheap dollar-store
and vending machine jewellery containing lead.  I think we will
have a "no cheap tacky-ass jewellery" rule in this house.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr width="40%"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you are, perchance, looking for a hydrocortisone preparation,
perhaps for a rash which has mysteriously appeared on your
oldest daughter's hand, and you should happen to notice that
of the three preparations available, "cream", "ointment" and
"lotion", the lotion seems to be the best deal, you should 
know that said lotion is in fact largely composed of isopropyl
alcohol.  Whoever thought it was a good idea to sell ALCOHOL
to put on RASHES deserves some kind of Stupid award, which they
can share with me for buying it without reading the ingredients
list.  I am going to see if I can return it for a refund tomorrow.

First I want to say that the idea of this unsolicited 
advice is to publish things that I have learned through
my own experience that I did not read about elsewhere,
in books or in magazines, or that I read so many 
conflicting recommendations about that I might as well
have not read any.  I'm trying to avoid all the really
obvious stuff, or the stuff which is widely published.
But what I've learned is that all babies are
different, and what worked for me might not work for 
you, so take this for what it is; advice born from the
experience of one (well-read, intelligent) mother of
two (really easy) children.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Diaper cream&lt;/strong&gt; is one of those things which
everyone has a different recommendation for, which leads
me to believe that different things work for different
babies.  All I have to say here is that diaper creams
which contain fish oil will make your baby smell like
a salmon cannery, and if you use cloth diapers they will
continue to smell fishy even after laundering.  Read 
labels carefully, and try all the other kinds of diaper 
cream first.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Okay, one more thing.  Johnsons 3-in-1 Diaper Cream and
Aveeno Diaper Cream have exactly the same ingedients and
are made by the same company, so buy the one that's on
sale.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr width="40%"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bathing&lt;/strong&gt; babies is something that I have
never quite figured out.  They're too big for the kitchen
sink (assuming your kitchen sink is clean enough anyway)
and too small for the tub, and I can't stomach spending
money on one of those in-bath baby holders (which Health 
Canada advises against anyway).  They're slippery as 
hell, they hate being bathed, and how dirty does a baby
get anyway?  I resolved the problem by just not
bathing my babies very often, until they're old enough
to sit up and manage the whole process more-or-less 
by themselves, as Delphine is.  And she still only gets
a bath twice a week.  Who has time for more?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr width="40%"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is probably too late for the unindentified target
for this advice, but perhaps not for you:  get yourself
a &lt;a href="http://www.babytrekker.com/"&gt;BabyTrekker&lt;/a&gt;.
They are so much better than the other comparable 
products I don't even want to go into it.  They are
way more comfortable, distribute the weight of the baby
much more sensibly over your body, and they carry up
to 40 lbs, which is considerably more than Delphine 
weighs at almost three years of age.  (I don't let her
go in the Trekker any more because I think it looks
silly.  I am so mean.)  Plus you can use them as a front
or backpack.  I love my Trekker.  I just wish they
had come out with the Tasteful Taupe model when we bought
ours; we have Fugly Forest Green.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr width="40%"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You're going to need to get yourself a &lt;strong&gt;5 ml
medication syringe&lt;/strong&gt;. Lots of medications for 
babies come with 1 mL rubber bulb syringes, which not 
only make it hard to get the right dosage into the syringe
(and then into the baby),
but are often too small to contain the whole dose at
once.  For example, I needed to give Cordelia some 
Tempra, which comes with a 1 mL bulb dispenser, but
I needed to give her 1.25 mL.  That means I have to
go through the measuring part twice, AND the horribly
traumatic squeezing it into the unwilling child's mouth
part twice.  She's no slouch, and once she's learned that
the syringe means foul pink unction, the next part of the
dose is going to end up in her ear.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The good news is that some medications come with the
good kind of syringe (I think Tylenol is one of them)
so don't throw that out after the medication is done,
keep it in your first aid kit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr width="40%"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Something more metaphysical to end (because Cordelia's
awake now).  I had trouble, with Delphine, understanding
that she is just a baby for a little while.  Intellectually,
of course, I understand that she's going to grow up, but
in some more primitive part of my brain it seemed that
every day of not enough sleep, too many diapers and no
time to do housework, let alone read, was just the first
day of thousands more of the same.  I guess, having never
watched a baby grow up before, I didn't really believe it would
happen.  And it makes sense; any changes in my life until
now I have effected through my own labour: I took a course,
or looked for a new job, or bought a new condo, or whatever.
I'm not used to standing by and watching my life change
outside of my own volition.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It's much easier with Cordelia.  When I have a horrible
day when all she wants is to be held all day, and I have
laundry and vacuuming and cooking to do and nothing is
getting done, I know that this is just temporary, that
eventually she will be able to walk and talk and play
by herself, and she won't need me every single minute.
That makes it much easier.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Incidentally, it seems this is a hard lesson to learn;
I still have moments which I think the Delphine is going
to be a whiny, needy, contrary toddler forever, even
though I know, logically, that one day she will be a 
pleasant and helpful three-year-old.  I just can't
see how it will happen, because I haven't seen it 
happen before.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>advice</category><category>unsolicited</category><guid>http://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/unsolicited%20advice/misc.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2006 16:16:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Some More Advice</title><link>http://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/unsolicited%20advice/more.html</link><dc:creator>Amy Brown</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
First I need to add a couple of things about the high chair.
You probably already have a thousand thin flannel receiving
blankets -- if you don't now is a good time to go get some,
or better, find a friend (or an aunt with a friend) who has
a serger, and get them to make you a bunch of two foot by
two foot squares of flannel.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Once you have your pile of blankets, fold one up so that it
lines the high chair under the baby.  Then when the
inevitable explosive poo happens you will only have to 
wash the blanket, not the entire high chair cover.  Repeat
as necessary for bouncy chair, car seat, stroller, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You'll also need a rolled up hand towel to prop next to
the baby in the high chair, so she doesn't topple over
sideways.  
&lt;a href="http://delphine.latte.ca/pics/2003/0702/03-w-inChair.jpg"&gt;Like
this.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Diapers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven't come across a brand of diapers which isn't perfectly 
adequate.  They all seem to do the trick, store-brand or name-brand
alike.  Huggies are a little nicer in that they are softer and
stretchier, but they don't objectively function any better.  Pampers
are just weird because they are scented:  why?  If you get
on Huggies' mailing list they will send you big fat coupons on
a regular basis, so you can feel a bit better about spending
huge piles of money on diapers, but I'm not sure how I got on
the list.  Maybe just email them and ask?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Wipes, on the other hand, are not all created equal.  The cheap
brands all seem to be smooth and thin and useless at sponging up
poop.  We stick with Huggies-brand wipes when we're out, and wet washcloths
when we're home, which you probably won't want to do unless you
launder your own cloth diapers.  Huggies are more expensive, but
since you probably use twice as many of the cheap kind maybe
it works out in the end.  There might be other good brands out
there, but I'm warning you, buy a small package to start off
with because you don't want to be stuck with 200 lousy wipes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I don't think you're using cloth diapers because you're not
INSANE, but if you do and you wash them yourself, let me tell
you the big secret:  use Tide.  There is all sorts of advice
out there to have two diaper pails, or to soak overnight, or
to rinse with vinegar, blah dee blah dee blah.  I just stick
the diapers in a pail all by their smelly selves, and then
dump them in the washer on a heavy-duty hot cycle with Tide.
Voila, fresh, stain-free diapers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Incidentally, in other laundry news, most stains ever encountered
by man or baby can be removed with an overnight soak in a wash basin with
hot water and some Oxy-Clean.  I just used it to get some thirty-year-old
stains out of a hand-me-down blanket from when Blake was a baby.
It's freaky-good.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Sleeping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you're nursing, the best advice I can give you is to sleep
with your baby.  I've slept with both of mine and I had to nod
politely through all those conversations with other mothers about
being so sleep-deprived, because I'm just not.  Baby wakes up, you
offer the boob, baby nurses while you drift back to sleep.
And sleeping with your baby is just nice.  It's lovely to be
able to smell her soft round head in the middle of the night.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I don't know if I would try it if I were bottle-feeding, though,
because breast-feeding mothers actually sleep more lightly than
normal people, so you're less likely to squish your baby in the
night.  Also don't sleep with your baby if you smoke (!), or if
you've been drinking or taken medication which makes you sleepy
like Neo-Citran.  Also the baby should sleep next to you, not
between you and your husband, again because of the rolling-onto
issue.  We have a bed rail on my side of the bed but it's just a
technicality, because your baby will glom onto you like a remora.
It's astonishing how quickly a supposedly non-mobile baby will make
her way across a bed to the nearest warm body.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(Having said that, I still think the bed rail is a good idea.
And don't put the baby on the bed between you and a wall, there's just
too much scope for disaster there.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You'll also want another one of those receiving blankets under
your baby and your boobs, to catch poop and spit-up and spilled
milk.  It's a lot easier to change a small blanket than your
entire bottom sheet.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Crying&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Blake's advice for dealing with a crying baby is, do everything
you can think of.  Then do it again.  Eventually something will
work.  My advice is, do all the sensible things (feed, change, 
burp, rock, etc) and if nothing works, take off all her clothes.
Ostensibly you're looking for rashes or irritating tags on her
clothes or whatever, but I find babies just like being naked.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Remember crying peaks at six weeks, so this won't actually go on
forever.  And if you have done everything you can think of and
she's still crying (and you don't think she's sick), remember to
keep cuddling her.  Even if you can't make her stop crying at least
you can give her comfort.  (Unless you think you might throw
her out the window; in that case, put the baby down (somewhere
safe) and back away (maybe into the shower or something) -- give
yourself a time-out.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Another thing you might do, although I don't remember doing this
with Delphine, is go out for a walk.  Fresh air usually settles
babies down and if she's tired the stroller will help her sleep.
Our midwife told us about a 24-hour drugstore where there are
often groggy parents doing midnight laps with their babies in
strollers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One thing that helped me when I felt like a lousy parent because
I couldn't stop Delphine from crying was to think about people with
sick babies.  Blake was really sickly when he was a kid and he must
have spent HOURS of his life crying, and it doesn't seem to have
done him any harm.  I have a friend whose baby had open-heart
surgery at six months -- he must have cried so much, and there was
nothing his parents could do, but he is a perfectly normal and
happy kid now.  So don't put too much stock in the crying -- it's
upsetting to you, the parent, because it's meant to be, but it
doesn't always mean something is horribly wrong that you can
fix.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>advice</category><category>unsolicited</category><guid>http://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/unsolicited%20advice/more.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2006 21:49:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Unsolicited Advice</title><link>http://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/unsolicited%20advice/newbaby.html</link><dc:creator>Amy Brown</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
I have this friend who just had a baby, and I am about busting
with advice that she does not want.  But!  There is so much I
have learned about babies!  I want to share!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So I will non-agressively put what I have learned here so she
can take my advice or not without giving offence, and also so it's available for
anyone else who wants it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of course I don't suggest that all of this advice will work
for everyone, but some of it will work for someone, and I
think the more we all talk about how we handle this parenting 
thing the better off we will be.  (To that end you should go
read &lt;a href="http://smartypants.diaryland.com/"&gt;Mimi
Smartypants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.dooce.com/"&gt;Dooce&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Your baby is going sleep most of the time, but after she's a
couple of weeks old she'll be awake sometimes too.  Most of the time
you'll be feeding her and changing her diaper, but sometimes 
you're going to want to put her down.  Get a &lt;strong&gt;high
chair&lt;/strong&gt;.  One that reclines a lot so you can put a 
newborn in it.  We have an Evenflo Simplicity Easy-fold which 
I am very happy with.  Cordelia sits in it and hangs out while
I'm cooking or typing or whatever.  Also it has wheels on it
so I can wheel her around the condo with me.  (You're not
supposed to wheel it around with the baby in it, but whatever.)
And I tip it all the way back and put a blanket on her and
a soother in her mouth, and bang, she's asleep.  (I think
the way the chair surrounds her is more comforting than lying
flat on her back in the crib -- she's only four months out of the
womb, after all.)  It's her one-stop captain's chair.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Interestingly I haven't heard this advice anywhere else -- where
do other people put their babies when they're awake?  Alone in
their crib?  In a bouncy chair so all they can see is knees?
Flat on their back in a playpen to look at the ceiling?  I don't
know.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Okay, that's all for now because Cordelia is howling (in her
high chair -- it doesn't work miracles!).
