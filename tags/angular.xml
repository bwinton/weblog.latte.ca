I’m writing to make it easy for designers to link mockups to live bugs.  But I
didn’t mention that I had a reasonably-working version of the tool written in
&lt;a href="http://backbonejs.org/"&gt;Backbone&lt;/a&gt; which I’ve decided to port to &lt;a href="http://angularjs.org/"&gt;Angular&lt;/a&gt;.  The reasons why are largely beside the point of this
blog post, but I’ll try to sum them up by saying that I reached a point where
Backbone seemed to be confusing me more than helping me, and Angular got a
&lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of good press at &lt;a href="http://fluentconf.com/fluent2013"&gt;FluentConf&lt;/a&gt; this
year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this morning’s task in &lt;a href="https://github.com/bwinton/arewecreatingyet/commits/feature/angular"&gt;the re-write&lt;/a&gt; was to
re-hook up the &lt;a href="https://login.persona.org/about"&gt;Persona&lt;/a&gt; integration.  I had
read recently that when you had a lot of dom-manipulation functions, you should
probably put that code in a directive, and since I hadn’t written an Angular
directive yet, I figured this would be a great time to learn how.  Writing &lt;a href="https://github.com/bwinton/arewecreatingyet/blob/feature/angular/views/index.html#L30"&gt;the
html&lt;/a&gt;
was pretty easy, of course, and most of the code from the existing
implementation (which was largely based on the code from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/jbuck/express-persona/blob/master/README.md"&gt;express-persona
readme&lt;/a&gt;) could
be ported over fairly quickly.  The only tricky part I ran into was figuring
out that I needed to include &lt;a href="https://github.com/bwinton/angular-tools/blob/master/persona.js#L36"&gt;&lt;code&gt;restrict: 'E'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the
&lt;a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive#directivedefinitionobject"&gt;Directive Definition Object&lt;/a&gt;.  After I
was done, I noticed that there really wasn’t that much in the code that had
anything to do with the tool I’m writing, and thus I pulled it out into a
separate repo so that other people can use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, I announce &lt;a href="https://github.com/bwinton/angular-tools/"&gt;Angular-Tools&lt;/a&gt;, a repo containing one or more tools
which you might find useful if you build Angular apps.  As always, pull
requests and bug reports welcome!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>angular</category><category>mozilla</category><category>persona</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/firefox/angularpersonatool.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2013 19:16:50 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
