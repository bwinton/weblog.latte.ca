I guess it has.  Tan Quach, I know
you've got stuff to say because you bother me with trivialities every
day over IM.  So comment here, and tell me about your new house, and
your fancy job, and the Bodog girlsâ„¢.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>callouts</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/callOuts/tanquach.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2006 16:02:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>It's that time again...</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/callOuts/leontinemay.html</link><dc:creator>Amy Brown</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Yup, it's the third Friday of this month, and so it's time for
another call out.  This time the random name generator has come up
with Leontine.  (I tried telling it that you weren't really a silent
lurker, and that you already post stuff on &lt;a href="http://leontinemay.blogspot.com/"&gt;your own weblog&lt;/a&gt; (mmm,
pretty pictures...), but being a piece of software, it wouldn't listen
to me.  Cursed Artificial Non-intelligence.)&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>callouts</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/callOuts/leontinemay.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2005 15:26:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>I'm calling you out!</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/callOuts/jaydeen.html</link><dc:creator>Amy Brown</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;From conversations with various people, I know that there are a lot
more of you out there reading this weblog than have commented, and
it's a little strange having this one-sided conversation.  Or, rather,
it's strange when I see you in person, and you already know everything
that's happened to me, so I'm left with little to talk about other
than the weather.  So the third Friday of every month, I'm going to
call one of you silent lurkers out, and ask you to post a reply to
this message letting me know how you're doing, and what's
happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today's victim is Jay Deen.  Jay!  I know you're out there!
Introduce yourself, and tell me what's going on in your life.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>callouts</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/callOuts/jaydeen.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 Nov 2005 15:38:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
