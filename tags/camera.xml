the web.  Nothing too exciting, I don't think, but they turned out
reasonably well.  When I convert them to their final web-based format
I scale them down so that they're smaller than 800x700.  If that's
still too large, or too slow, &lt;a href="mailto:bwinton@latte.ca"&gt;let me
know&lt;/a&gt;, and I'll see about cutting it back further.  When I'm using
my laptop (which runs at 1024x768 (Shut up, you!)) I get about 15
pixels worth of scrollbar, but I don't know if that's because of my
overly large IE title settings, or if the pictures are actually too
large.</description><category>camera</category><guid>http://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/camera/pics1.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2003 17:51:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New Art!</title><link>http://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/camera/newart.html</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>Amy and I bought some new art this afternoon.  I had recently
seen a &lt;a href="http://www.postershop.com/Ullman-Gayle-p.html"&gt;poster&lt;/a&gt; that I thought she would like, and so when we went by
the store, we dropped in.  It turned out there was another in the
same series, and we agreed that they would look pretty good above
the computer.  So we got them, and hung them, and I put a &lt;a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/camera/2003-01-05/"&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt;
up.  The other picture is of a banana bread Amy made a while ago.</description><category>camera</category><guid>http://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/camera/newart.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2003 00:49:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
