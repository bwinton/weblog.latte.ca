The short-term goal of all this running foolishness is
to run the 5K event in the Toronto
Waterfront Marathon on September 24th, in aid of the
&lt;a href="http://www.awhl.org/"&gt;Assaulted Women's Helpline&lt;/a&gt;.
Initially my friend Michelle talked me into doing the 5K
walk because she is involved with the helpline, and then
I decided to upgrade to the run.  And now I have to collect
pledges, which I hate doing.  I sent out email, and I am posting
here, and hopefully that will earn me enough pledges to
get me off the hook.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It makes it easier that this is a pretty compelling cause.
If you
want some idea of why the helpline is needed, go to their
chilling page on 
&lt;a href="http://www.awhl.org/security.htm"&gt;how to erase your
online tracks&lt;/a&gt;.  Can you imagine
living under that kind of scrutiny, with someone who
believes they are entitled to that kind of control
over you, and having no way out?  It makes me angry just
thinking about it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So if you want to pledge some money for a good cause,
or just to express your astonishment that I am actually
running anywhere for any reason, 
&lt;a href="https://www.icanpledge.com/cyberpledge/pledge.asp?member_id=6347&amp;amp;org_id=130&amp;amp;fund_id=74"&gt;here's my online pledge page&lt;/a&gt;.  Thank you!

prevention &amp;amp; education services for people living with &amp;amp; at risk for
HIV/AIDS.
