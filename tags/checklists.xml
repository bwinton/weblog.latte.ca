them.  They are a &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Bwinton/Review_Checklist"&gt;Review Checklist&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Bwinton/Commit_Checklist"&gt;Commit
Checklist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They came about after I had been working mostly on experimental add-ons for
a while, and then attempted to push a couple of reviewed fixes.  Since I
was out of practice, I managed to get something minor wrong on both of the
pushes.  (The first one failed to attribute the patch to the proper author;
The second one failed to mention the bug number in the commit message.)
Since I’m a bit of a perfectionist, this really annoyed me, and so I vowed
to write up the steps that I go through when I need to commit and push a
patch, so that I could refer to them later, since if &lt;a href="http://us.macmillan.com/thechecklistmanifesto"&gt;checklists can save
lives&lt;/a&gt;, then I figure they
can probably also help me do my job better.  But before I go to that, I
needed to review a patch, so I wrote up some of the things I look for when
I review a patch too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>checklists</category><category>commit</category><category>mozilla</category><category>review</category><category>thunderbird</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/thunderbird/checklists/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2010 00:49:11 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
