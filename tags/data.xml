applications, and it presented the idea that Javascript is the same as
stack overflows which are also the same as getting free phone calls by
whistling a note into a payphone…&lt;br&gt;
They're all examples of bad things happening when you intermingle code
(javascript/return addresses/command tones) and data (html/arrays on
the stack/your voice).  I guess it’s sort of expensive to set up two
connections for every connection, but that seems to be the only way to
avoid stuff like this, which has apparently been happening for
years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think there’s a lot I can do with this new idea, but it
seemed interesting, so I figured I’ld record it for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>code</category><category>data</category><category>hacking</category><guid>https://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/codeanddata.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2008 01:25:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>This is my first post.</title><link>https://weblog.latte.ca/firstpost.html</link><dc:creator>Amy Brown</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
This is my first post with PyBlosxom on OSX.

Quick introduction.  Blog-o! is a weblog shared by Blake and Amy.  It's
split up into categories, which are listed in a sidebar over on the
right there.  If you click on one of the categories, you'll only see
posts in that category, so if you only ever want to see what Amy has
to say about Delphine, you could click on the "delphine" link under
"amy", then bookmark that page and never have to read anything else.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Blog-o! is run using PyBlosxom, a Python blogging doo-dad.  For more
information about that you'll have to talk to Blake (it's Amy writing
here) or click on the graphic over on the right.  I don't know how
it's supposed to be pronounced, but I advocate "pie-blossom".
