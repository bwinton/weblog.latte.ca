frozen in a block of ice for most of the winter, and got my bike out.
So this morning, I biked to work for the first time in, uh, I don’t
even know how long.  It was a pretty sweet ride, all in all.  There
were any number of reasons not to do it; my biking jeans are dirty,
it’s too cold, I couldn’t down-shift, but as always there was one
reason that trumped them all.  I wanted to ride again.  And so I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the things I forgot about during my hiatus were how good that
first cup of coffee tastes after you’ve been riding in -5° weather,
what a rush it is to pass cars as they’re sitting, idling in
stop-and-go traffic, and how invigorated I feel when I finally get to
the office, and sit down.  Oh, also how sore my butt is.  Damn, that’s
a small hard seat.  I can’t wait to get used to it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s about it.  I made it in safely, and I’m sure I’ll be
doing it again, and again, and pocketing the $22.50/week that would
have gone to the TTC, to spend on random upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>biking</category><category>cold</category><category>first_ride</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/random/biking/ontheroadagain/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2008 14:31:24 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
