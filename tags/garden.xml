Spring has arrived with an unlikely two sunny warm days
in a row, over a weekend!  We celebrated by playing in 
the muck.  We raked most of last fall's leaves off the
front and back lawns, and I cleared off and weeded 
some of the north border in the backyard.  I pulled
out about a ton of 
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glechoma_hederacea"&gt;creeping
charlie&lt;/a&gt;, which is surprisingly satisfying to uproot
when the ground is soft;
you can get hold of a bit without breaking the stem 
and then reel in about a foot of plant and roots, like
a magician pulling scarves out of a hat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also uprooted some of the many raspberries, and I cleaned
out some of the raspberry patch.  There are dozens of plants
there and it's hard to get the leaves and twigs and weeds
out from between them, to say nothing of trimming out the
dead canes, pulling out the millions of little suckers, 
and removing the raccoon poop.
I think the smart thing to do with the raspberry patch will
be to thin it out as well as reduce its overall footprint.
The previous owners must have really like raspberries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are lots of little things growing, but the only things
flowering yet are crocuses.  I'm not sure what the other
things are so I'm looking forward to their flowers.  Some
tulips I planted last fall are coming up in the front yard;
Delphine is very excited about that because she helped me
plant them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps the most remarkable accomplishment this week was that
Blake built a frame for our 
&lt;a href="http://www.squarefootgardening.com/"&gt;Square Foot Garden&lt;/a&gt;.
That's a technique for vegetable gardening whereby you plant
your entire garden in one (or more) four-by-four foot squares.
We picked out the spot for the garden and Blake was poking 
around in the shed and found four perfect four-and-a-half foot
planks, which he screwed together into a frame to delineate
and protect the garden.  I say this casually, as if Blake
screws things together to make other things all the time, but
if you know Blake you know that just isn't so.  He is not 
what you might call "handy".  However, he made a perfectly
lovely frame without swearing or drawing blood, so I think
he might be handier than either of us suspected.  The frame
is gracing our garden and waiting patiently for some nice
compost and lots of seeds.

&lt;b&gt;When:&lt;/b&gt; September 8th, 3:00 until 8:00 (or later)...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Where:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="mailto:bwinton%2Bparty%40latte%2Eca%0D%0A?subject=Where%20are%20you%3F"&gt;redacted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What:&lt;/b&gt; Beer, pizza, some kind of munchie thing, and some sort of
fancy blended drink (originally scheduled to be Margaritas, although I
don't know if I'm up for tequila (&lt;i&gt;shudder&lt;/i&gt;), so maybe Piña
Coladas, or some sort of Daiquiri).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSVP, so that I know how much beer/munchies to buy.  Or just show
up and take your chances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one thing I forgot to mention in the email, since Amy and I
have two kids, feel free to bring whatever little ones you have along,
and they can all look at each other distrustfully, or run around
screaming, or whatever it is children do when they get together in
large groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
See you there,&lt;br&gt;
Blake.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>deck</category><category>garden</category><category>party</category><category>reno</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/houseandhome/reno/deck/party/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 16 Aug 2007 14:06:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Daily Deck Update 11</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/houseandhome/reno/deck/july29/</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, I think the deck is officially done, and so it’s party time!
If you’re actually going to have a chance of making it here (sorry,
Dave), please &lt;a href="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/houseandhome/reno/deck/july29.html"&gt;leave
a comment&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="mailto:bwinton@latte.ca?Subject=Available%20Party%20Dates."&gt;email
me&lt;/a&gt; with the dates that work well for you, and I’ll see what works
out the best for the most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tricky part, I expect, will be restraining myself from writing
a program to figure out the optimal solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>deck</category><category>garden</category><category>party</category><category>reno</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/houseandhome/reno/deck/july29/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jul 2007 22:56:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Daily Deck Update 10</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/houseandhome/reno/deck/july26/</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/0726a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img align="left" src="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/small/0726a.jpg" alt="Get it?  Agate?  Get it?" style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

A Gate!  No longer just a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agate"&gt;pretty stone&lt;/a&gt;, we now
have a gate to keep out whatever’s been pooing in our yard.  (Assuming
it isn’t one of the girls.  Or a raccoon.  Or someone’s cat.  Or
something that could squeeze through the gap in the bottom.  But
still, it’s got to be less likely to continue, right?)&lt;br clear="left"&gt;

&lt;a href="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/0726b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img align="left" src="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/small/0726b.jpg" alt="The Shed." style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Our garbage shed!  It’s a bit larger than I thought it would be which
I think is partially due to the sloped roof, which is mandatory in
places that get as much snow as we sometimes do, and partially
because…  Well, I don’t know why else it might be so big.  Maybe just
because that was the scale of the space it had to take up.  &lt;br clear="left"&gt;

&lt;a href="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/0726c.jpg"&gt;&lt;img align="left" src="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/small/0726c.jpg" alt="Screen!" style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

And an old-new screen door.  This should get some air moving through
the house without my having to worry too much about finding a hornet
in my bed (again!)  And when the screen on the front gets installed,
it should be even sweeter.&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

No pictures today.  Try again tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>deck</category><category>garden</category><category>reno</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/houseandhome/reno/deck/july25/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jul 2007 01:45:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Daily Deck Update 8</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/houseandhome/reno/deck/july24/</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/0724a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img align="left" src="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/small/0724a.jpg" alt="Stairs!" style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

It’s getting close...  The planters are done, and the garbage bin
(which seems larger than I thought it would be) is framed in.&lt;br clear="left"&gt;

&lt;a href="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/0724b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img align="left" src="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/small/0724b.jpg" alt="Stonehenge.  Kinda." style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

A closer-up view of one of the planters, along with the base to the
umbrella for the patio table, and the gas hookup for the barbeque.&lt;br clear="left"&gt;

&lt;a href="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/0724c.jpg"&gt;&lt;img align="left" src="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/small/0724c.jpg" alt="Stairs!" style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

And the inside of the garbage bin, with obligatory cat.&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

Okay, so the comments were a little weak today, I’m recovering from a
severe arm wound, cut me some slack.

&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>deck</category><category>garden</category><category>reno</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/houseandhome/reno/deck/july24/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jul 2007 02:23:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Daily Deck Update 7</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/houseandhome/reno/deck/july23/</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/0723a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img align="left" src="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/small/0723a.jpg" alt="Stairs!" style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The facing went on!  Apparently we got fewer long planks than we
needed, so Cory couldn’t finish the deck itself, so instead he put on
the facing, and started building the frames for the planters.  Hey,
I just noticed the big long stair at the front.  Neat!&lt;br clear="left"&gt;

&lt;a href="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/0723b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img align="left" src="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/small/0723b.jpg" alt="Stonehenge.  Kinda." style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

And another shot of the side stairs, with facing.&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>deck</category><category>garden</category><category>reno</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/houseandhome/reno/deck/july23/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2007 00:42:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Daily Deck Update 6</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/houseandhome/reno/deck/july20/</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/0720a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img align="left" src="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/small/0720a.jpg" alt="Stairs!" style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Finally, a set of stairs!  I can’t tell you how excited I am about
those, although I am a little curious as to why that first step is
twice as long as the second…  Maybe the ground moved up.  Yeah, that's
what I'll go with.&lt;br clear="left"&gt;

&lt;a href="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/0720b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img align="left" src="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/small/0720b.jpg" alt="Stonehenge.  Kinda." style="margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

This line of stones brought to you by Cordelia.  It’s nice to see that
she can create order as well as chaos.&lt;br clear="left"&gt;

&lt;a href="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/0720c.jpg"&gt;&lt;img align="left" src="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/small/0720c.jpg" alt="A window to nowhere." style="margin-right:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

And finally, a bonus picture for Andrew.  Yes, that was a window you
saw under our deck.  I’m not sure how we’ll get light into the
basement now.  Perhaps with electricity.  (I’m also not sure what is
going to happen to the edge of the deck, so we just might still get
some light from the edges.&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

and so nothing’s going to happen to the deck today.  Perhaps
tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;(Oh, and the weather department doesn't keep historical
pages active, so by the time you click on the little cloud, it might
say something completely different.)&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>deck</category><category>garden</category><category>reno</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/houseandhome/reno/deck/july19/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jul 2007 14:20:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Daily Deck Update 4</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/houseandhome/reno/deck/july18/</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/0718.jpg"&gt;&lt;img align="left" src="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/deck2007/small/0718.jpg" alt="Halfway done." style="margin-right:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Wow, is that ever going quickly.  At
least, far quicker than I would have been able to do it.  The last
quarter of the last board in the big group on the right isn't screwed
down yet, but I’m sure it’s only a matter of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still to do, the stairs, the planters, and the garbage bin.  We
might not be getting a barbeque until the end of the summer, because a
friend of the family is downsizing, and might give us her’s, but
either way, I plan on having a party when the deck is done, with beer
and margaritas and some sort of munchie thing.  And of course you’re
all invited!  I’ll start planning it after the deck is actually done,
and post details when they’re finalized.&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>deck</category><category>garden</category><category>reno</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/houseandhome/reno/deck/july18/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jul 2007 01:41:21 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
