Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been playing around a lot with the iTouch, and developing
quite a few programs for it.  The first one was by request, although
I’m also finding it very useful.  (And apparently a &lt;a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?p=4754458"&gt;few other
people&lt;/a&gt; are as well!  Cool!)  It’s called &lt;a href="http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/~chris/iphone/WifiToggle/"&gt;WifiToggle&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a small app that simply toggles on and off
your Wifi connection, so as to save batteries.  The next thing I did
was &lt;a href="http://iphone.latte.ca/info/Javascript.html"&gt;a port&lt;/a&gt;
of the &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/"&gt;SpiderMonkey
Javascript&lt;/a&gt; interpreter.  It works, and it wasn’t that hard to get
compiled and installed, which is really pretty cool when you stop to
think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final thing I got working just tonight (which I was playing
around with mostly to take my mind off of stuff.  See tomorrow’s post
for details), was &lt;a href="http://iphone.latte.ca/info/GambitScheme.html"&gt;a port&lt;/a&gt; of the
&lt;a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/wiki/index.php/Main_Page"&gt;Gambit Scheme&lt;/a&gt; interpreter.  I know, Scheme is just like
Javascript, only with an uglier syntax, but I still like it, and
hopefully the lack of punctuation will make it easier to use on the
iTouch.  Heh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, if you own an iPhone or iTouch, and have jailbroken it, be
sure to add &lt;a href="http://iphone.latte.ca/"&gt;http://iphone.latte.ca/&lt;/a&gt; to your list of Installer sources, and
geek out!&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>itouch</category><category>javascript</category><category>languages</category><category>scheme</category><guid>https://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/iTouch/languages.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jan 2008 02:06:51 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
