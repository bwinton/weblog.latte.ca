And the more I read the less compelling they seemed‚Ä¶  As I talked with my co-workers, I heard some really good reviews of a couple of models of Windows computers, and since 90% of Firefox‚Äôs users are using Windows it‚Äôs probably not such a bad idea if I use it, too, both to help me understand the problems they‚Äôre running into, and to make sure that the code I‚Äôm writing will work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on Friday I bit the bullet and ordered a Dell &lt;a href="http://www.dell.com/ca/p/xps-15-9550-laptop/pd?oc=nxps15550_bt_h1609e&amp;amp;l=en&amp;amp;s=dhs" title="Link to the Dell Store"&gt;XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; (with Touch screen, 32Gb RAM, and a 1Tb SSD) for my latest laptop refresh.  I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that the recent updates to the &lt;a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/2016/04/22/windows-subsystem-for-linux-overview/" title="Windows Subsystem for Linux"&gt;Windows Subsystem for Linux&lt;/a&gt; will let me do all the same Unix-y stuff I‚Äôve been doing on the Mac, and if I use the same keyboard and trackpad, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll notice much of a difference, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dude.  I‚Äôm getting a Dell." src="https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/images/blake/Dell.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs going to be a few weeks before it arrives, which is nice because it lets me think about all the stuff I‚Äôll need to transfer over, and because it lets &lt;a href="http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2016/11/14/switching-sides/" title="Switching Sides"&gt;Mike Hoye&lt;/a&gt; go through all the pain of switching before I do, so I can hopefully avoid the worst pitfalls.  üòâ  There is, of course, a &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Transitioning_to_Windows#Applications_.26_tools" title="Transitioning to Windows"&gt;guide to switching&lt;/a&gt; for Mozilla people, but it‚Äôs pretty out of date.  I‚Äôll probably be updating it as I run into stuff, and hopefully the other people who are also switching will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here‚Äôs the big list of stuff I currently use, and replacements (where I know what they are):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, the obvious ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://slack.com/" title="Slack"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; ‚áí Slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" title="Firefox"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; ‚áí Firefox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.twitter.com/products/twitter-for-windows/" title="Twitter for Windows"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; ‚áí Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.crashplan.com/en-us/" title="Crashplan"&gt;Crashplan&lt;/a&gt; ‚áí Crashplan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html" title="Chrome"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; ‚áí Chrome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the slightly more complicated ones: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://iterm2.com/" title="iTerm 2"&gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt; ‚áí &lt;a href="http://cmder.net/" title="Œªcmder"&gt;Cmder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Cmder isn‚Äôt the same, but it‚Äôs the best Windows terminal app I‚Äôve found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;: I might go with &lt;a href="https://conemu.github.io/" title="ConEMU"&gt;ConEMU&lt;/a&gt;, the program underlying Cmder, instead. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/" title="Safari"&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt; ‚áí Also Chrome.  Or maybe &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge" title="Microsoft Edge"&gt;Edge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
    I use Safari mostly for YouTube.  I used to use Chrome for this; maybe I‚Äôll go back, or maybe it‚Äôs time to try a new browser.  I hear Edge has really good battery life while watching video‚Ä¶  üôÇ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://atom.io/" title="Atom"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; ‚áí Atom (or &lt;a href="http://code.visualstudio.com/" title="Visual Studio Code"&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;br&gt;
    I‚Äôve heard not-great things about Atom on Windows, so I‚Äôm starting to look into switching to Visual Studio Code.  So far it seems okay‚Ä¶  I do miss the minimap and &lt;a href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-whimsy" title="Atom Whimsy"&gt;Whimsy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home" title="Dropbox"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; ‚áí Dropbox (or &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/" title="Google Drive"&gt;Google Drive&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.getcloudapp.com/" title="CloudApp"&gt;CloudApp&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;br&gt;
    Mozilla moved to Google Apps for our email, and now we have a big shared space there.  Should we really still be paying for Dropbox Pro accounts for our team?  Maybe not‚Ä¶  Of course, I don‚Äôt think Google Drive uploads screenshots automatically, so maybe I‚Äôll also need to install CloudApp for that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://secure.flyingmeat.com/acorn/" title="Acorn"&gt;Acorn&lt;/a&gt; ‚áí &lt;a href="http://www.getpaint.net/index.html" title="Paint.net"&gt;Paint.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Totally not the same, but I think paint.net will do &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the stuff I want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that is the software I‚Äôm unsure about alternatives for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://limechat.net/mac/" title="LimeChat for Mac"&gt;LimeChat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    I‚Äôve been looking for a while, but still haven‚Äôt found a beautiful IRC client for Windows.  (Please don‚Äôt suggest mIRC, or irssi over ssh‚Ä¶  Anyone who considers those ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù clearly doesn‚Äôt share my aesthetic. üòù)  The closest I‚Äôve found has been &lt;a href="http://fooirc.com/#!index.md" title="Foo IRC"&gt;Foo IRC&lt;/a&gt;, but I‚Äôm not sure how well it works.  For some reason I had a pinned tab open on &lt;a href="http://www.icechat.net/site/" title="IceChat"&gt;IceChat&lt;/a&gt;‚Äôs page, but I‚Äôm not a big fan of how it looks‚Ä¶&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/p/irc-explorer/9wzdncrdkmgz" title="IRC Explorer"&gt;IRC Explorer&lt;/a&gt; looks pretty nice, too‚Ä¶ &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mail.app&lt;br&gt;
    I‚Äôm not really enthused with Apple‚Äôs Mail app, but it‚Äôs not terrible.  I hear Microsoft‚Äôs Mail app is pretty similar, so I‚Äôll give it a try.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://xscopeapp.com/" title="XScope"&gt;XScope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    I don‚Äôt think there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; anything like XScope on Windows 10.  I might just have to go back to my Mac for the kinda stuff I use it for‚Ä¶
    &lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="http://ngwin.com/picpick" title="PicPick"&gt;PicPick&lt;/a&gt; looks like it might do some of the stuff XScope does‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And things I just don‚Äôt know about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calendar.app&lt;br&gt;
    I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; on Windows that does calendaring, but will it connect to my home iCal account?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/" title="Things"&gt;Things&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    I don‚Äôt use this a ton these days, but it‚Äôs good for keeping track of what‚Äôs on my plate.  I may just continue to use it on my iPhone‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/" title="iTunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    I don‚Äôt think &lt;a href="http://www.winamp.com/" title="WinAmp"&gt;WinAmp&lt;/a&gt; or iTunes for Windows are really what I‚Äôm looking for here.  I might switch to a combination of &lt;a href="https://play.spotify.com/search/hamilton%20mixtape" title="Spotify"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and my iPhone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://anvilformac.com/" title="Anvil for Mac"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Do I still need to run folders as websites?  Maybe not so much these days, since I‚Äôm using &lt;a href="http://webpack.github.io/" title="Webpack"&gt;webpack&lt;/a&gt;a lot more, and it comes with a dev server. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://qsapp.com/" title="Quicksilver"&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    I think I could probably use the Cortana search menu for most of what I use Quicksilver for‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trankynam.com/atext/" title="aText"&gt;aText&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    This is another one of those ‚ÄúThere &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to be something like this‚Äù apps, but I have no idea what it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suggestions for any of the apps mentioned above would be very appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>expectation</category><category>moving</category><category>windows</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/windows/welp.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2016 15:21:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Settling</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/amy/houseandhome/settling.html</link><dc:creator>Amy Brown</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
People keep asking me if we're getting settled in,
and until today I was getting pretty tired of it,
because I really didn't feel all that settled.
Today, though, we moved a bunch of boxes out of
the living room and laid down the rug, cleared
the upstairs landing, and unpacked a couple of
big bins, and now it finally does feel like we're
getting settled, like this is really where we 
live and not just where all our stuff is.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of course we still have a million things to
unpack, but we have been cleverly hiding boxes
in the basement rather than face them, and we
are managing quite nicely with the forty 
percent of our possessions that we have unpacked.
I have a grand plan for unpacking the rest 
which involves a large box labelled "Garage
Sale"; Blake and I will dig into that project
in the New Year.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It's a crappy little house (in some ways, and
in others it's wonderful), and sometimes I 
wonder why we bought it.  The kitchen needs 
redoing, the bathroom needs redoing (not to
mention there's only the one), the basement
isn't done at all... this house is a money sponge
capable of absorbing every spare
penny for the next two decades.  Why didn't we
buy one of the shiny, renovated perfect houses
with the dug-out, finished basements and the
second bathrooms and the nice kitchens?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Money, for one thing; we didn't pay much for
this place.  But we're going to have to put more
than the difference back into it to get it up
to snuff.  The burning desire to be knee-deep
in plaster dust for the next five years?  A
passion to express myself through interior
design?  That can't be right.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I don't think that's the reason we bought
the house.
I think we fell in love with the
oldness of it, with the perfect trim and the
retro cabinets, and with the challenge of
taking this beloved old house and bringing it
up to date without erasing its character; 
deciding what to keep and what to take away.
Taking what is in a sense a blank slate and
making it our own.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We've got some pretty good ideas about keeping
the character while still beating the house
into twenty-first century submission.  We're
going to rip down a bunch of walls, but save
the trim and cleverly use it elsewhere:  we're
going to use the trim from between the living
room and the dining room to frame a huge
pass-through between the kitchen and the dining
room; we're going to use trim from one of the
doors to create an archway at the end of the
new front hall; we're going to use two doors
to make a headboard, and another to make a mirror
for the top of the stairs.  We're going to 
salvage the doorknobs and line them up on a
board to hang coats and hats on.  We're going
to patch the floors rather than refinish
(or replace) the hardwood.  And of course
I want to do the kitchen in a style reminiscent
of the fifties; I almost want the kitchen to 
look like it was installed in the fifties
and impeccably maintained, rather than to
look like a new kitchen with all the latest
fashions and gadgets.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I think when we're done this first phase of
renovations, the house will be modern and
comfortable, with an open living space, lots
of light and air, a large, usable kitchen,
and new wiring and light switches in sensible
places, but it will still retain the patina of
age that we love.
