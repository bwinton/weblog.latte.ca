to back in university.  Something like a cross between Sloan and Live,
or The Lowest of the Low.  Live, maybe?  It wasn't any of those but
that was the sort of genre it reminds me of...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what I'm trying to say there is that as far as I can tell,
it's classic Indie Rock, circa 1994, and god help me, I love it.  I'm
sure the muscial landscape has changed in the last 12, no, wait, 13
years, but it's good to see that there are still bands out there who
are playing the things I used to hear.  Damn, does that means that I'm
old, when I start liking songs like the ones I used to hear?  I'll
just chalk it up to nostalgia instead of age.  Shut up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should probably put in &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Forecast"&gt;a link&lt;/a&gt; to more info,
shouldn't I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I know I totally missed the 1500 character target, but
man, this reviewing thing is hard.  All the harder when I'm only
listening to music at the office, where I'm really trying to
concentrate on my job, instead of on the music.  The first few times I
listened to the album, I was halfway through the following album
before I realized that I should have been listening.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>alternative</category><category>from_jessica</category><category>music</category><category>new_music</category><category>review</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/reviews/forecast.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2007 22:12:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Dieselboy - The Human Resource</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/reviews/dieselboy.html</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Pretty sweet.  They were described to me as "slightly-harder drum
and bass", which worried me a little, since I didn't know if I would
be up for something heavy, but either it was only slightly-harder, or
I don't know how hard regular drum and bass is, or I ended up being in
a heavier mood than I thought I was, because I thoroughly enjoyed the
album.  It sort of drifted into the background, which is exactly what
I'm hoping for when I listen to music at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not entirely sure what else to say here.  I suppose I could add
that they didn't seem as minimal as the Plastikman/FUSE albums I've
got, and they were a lot less sample-heavy than Mushroom Jazz by Mark
Farina, but I don't think that really tells you much about the music
itself.  Hopefully, with more exposure to some quality drum and bass,
I'll be able to give more informed opinions, but for now, I guess this
will have to be my baseline for future reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, one more thing, the next few reviews might run a little late,
because even though I've listened to the music, I only have a couple
of hundred words written about each of them, and I'm guessing that
it'll take some re-listening to think of more things to say.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>drum_and_bass</category><category>from_jon</category><category>music</category><category>new_music</category><category>review</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/reviews/dieselboy.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2007 19:16:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
