While I was home alone with Delphine, I subscribed to a few podcasts
in iTunes, so that we would have a ton of new music to listen to, but
when I went back to work, I forgot to unsubscribe, and as a result
filled up my entire hard drive with music and videos.  This caused a
bunch of things to fail for various reasons, the most notable of which
being that no-one has recieved any email for the past few days.  I can
only hope that the various mail servers around the world will continue
trying to send the messages, but if there’s something urgent that you
really wanted a response to, you might consider re-sending it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>doh!</category><category>itunes</category><category>out_of_space</category><category>podcasts</category><guid>https://weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/itscrampedinhere.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2007 17:34:48 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
