I posted &lt;a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/"&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt;!  Hopefully
a picture really is worth a thousand words because I'm not getting many
words up here lately.

I finished my game, I fired up Sketches, and this is what she ended up
painting.  It’s nothing in particular, but kind of pretty nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

asked if we could draw another picture.  So we did.  Then we emailed
it to Amy, and I got Delphine to tell me what letters to write for her
sentence.  (I also told her about putting a space between each word,
which is something that Ms. Hollister said that we could tell her
about if we wanted.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sentence was “Ths is a heis on a hil wth to bsis.”, which I’m sure
you can all read as “This is a house on a hill with two bushes.”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="https://weblog.latte.ca/images/delphine/2008-06-12/Sketches.jpg"&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>delphine</category><category>images</category><category>itouch</category><category>pictures</category><guid>https://weblog.latte.ca/delphine/pictures/jun12.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2008 02:40:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>More pictures.</title><link>https://weblog.latte.ca/delphine/pictures/mar16.html</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since Delphine has wanted to play on my little
computer at bedtime.  We’ve been too busy reading old, old books about
animals of various kinds.  Yesterday, we both seemed to realize this,
and decided that tonight we would play on the little computer instead
of reading books.  I’m sure Delphine was thinking something more along
the lines of “We’ll play on the little computer, and &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; read
books”, but that was never going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commentary on this is “It’s a head.  On a slide.  With a hat,
and the sun.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="https://weblog.latte.ca/images/delphine/2008-03-16/Sketches.jpg"&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>delphine</category><category>images</category><category>itouch</category><category>pictures</category><guid>https://weblog.latte.ca/delphine/pictures/mar16.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2008 00:54:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Almost current.</title><link>https://weblog.latte.ca/delphine/pictures/feb10.html</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;There was a new version of Sketches in my update queue the last
time I checked.  The main feature of this one is the ability to draw
shapes, like arrows, ovals, and rectangles, as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="https://weblog.latte.ca/images/delphine/2008-02-10/Sketches.jpg"&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>delphine</category><category>images</category><category>itouch</category><category>pictures</category><guid>https://weblog.latte.ca/delphine/pictures/feb10.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 Feb 2008 02:12:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>More retconned pictures.</title><link>https://weblog.latte.ca/delphine/pictures/jan29.html</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The main tip-off that these are back-dated entries is my inability
not to use 21:12 as the posting time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left-hand image is of a flower beside a river.  The blue at the
top of the picture is the sky.  Only having one shade of blue is one
of the limitations you have to work around when using a free drawing
app on an MP3 player.  Less of a limitation when you’re 4.  The
drawing on the right is a flower, and the sun.  Or maybe it’s a
sunflower.  Heh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="left" src="https://weblog.latte.ca/images/delphine/2008-01-29/Sketches1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img align="right" src="https://weblog.latte.ca/images/delphine/2008-01-29/Sketches2.jpg"&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>delphine</category><category>images</category><category>itouch</category><category>pictures</category><guid>https://weblog.latte.ca/delphine/pictures/jan29.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2008 02:12:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Pictures.</title><link>https://weblog.latte.ca/delphine/pictures/jan26.html</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I’m retro-actively posting a few pictures, so if you think you
haven’t seen these entries before, you’re probably right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below you can see a flower.  A black flower.  Or maybe it was a
cloud.  The blue stuff is rain, anyways, I know that.&lt;/p&gt;

down because the magnets are running out of strength.  (Just a sun
today, on the default Etch-a-Sketch background, instead of the note
paper background of yesterday.)&lt;/p&gt;

before she goes to sleep.  I recently found out that I could email the
drawings to myself, and so here are Delphine’s drawings from
today.  The one on the left is obviously a flower, with the sun in the
sky.  The one on the right is, uh, just pretty with all the colours
mixed together, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
