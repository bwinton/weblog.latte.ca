on is coming along nicely, and so I figured it was time to let other people
see it.  Now, I could just have everyone huddle around my screen, but since
many of the people who would be interested aren’t in the same city (or even
same timezone) as I am, that wouldn’t work out so well.  We tried screen-
sharing, but a lot of what’s being worked on is animation, and the frame-rates
of the screen-sharing application we were using weren’t up to the task.  To
get around that, I could have recorded a video, but since a lot of the value
of a prototype like this is being able to play around with it, that’s also not
a great solution.  So, obviously, the best thing to do would be to put it on a
publicly available server, and let people run it in their own web browser,
whenever they wanted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m running a server or two that I could put it up on, but since the
project is related to Mozilla, and since Mozilla offers some personal webspace
on &lt;a href="http://people.mozilla.org/"&gt;one of their servers&lt;/a&gt;, I figured I might as
well put it up &lt;a href="https://people.mozilla.com/~bwinton/australis/customization/mac/?scroll"&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;.  :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to make it easy for me to remember to build and upload the code (and to
prevent me from trying to figure out all the correct options to rsync every
time I wanted to upload the code), I took a couple of minutes to &lt;a href="https://github.com/bwinton/australis-customization/blob/master/australis/customization/mac/volofile#L23"&gt;add a
command&lt;/a&gt; to my volofile, which lets me merely type &lt;code&gt;volo deploy&lt;/code&gt;, and have it
optimize the code, and copy only the changed files to the remote server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>deploy</category><category>mozilla</category><category>remote</category><category>rsync</category><category>server</category><category>volo</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/employment/mozilla/volodeploy.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jul 2012 18:04:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Okay, this is cool.</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/freewifi.html</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found myself downtown today, with nothing really to do between 3:30
and 6:30.  I suppose I could have headed over to U of T, but it seemed
like sort of a long way to go just to connect to the internet and come
all the way back again.  So instead of making the trek, or wasting two
tokens, I took advantage of the 2 hours of free WiFi that comes with
my Starbucks card, and stayed near Yonge, drinking green tea with a
little honey, and investigating a few bugs for work.  After it runs
out (in another 31 minutes), I think I'm going to pack up, and walk
north to my next appointment, grabbing some dinner on the way.  If I'm
right, that should put me right where I need to be, right when I need
to be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, if only everything in my life could fall into place this easily.
(The upgrade to Aquamacs 1.6 that I just did also worked out really
well.  Maybe today is just my day for doing stuff!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>remote</category><category>starbucks</category><category>wifi</category><category>work</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/freewifi.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2009 21:49:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
