should ask to review them.  Now that I’ve been in the community for a
while, I’ve got a much better sense of who I should be talking to for the
type of things I’m likely to write, but there are still times when I want
to make a change in a part of the code that I haven’t touched before, and
I’m not sure who to ask.  In those cases, I usually fall back to a fairly
simple (if non-obvious) set of steps to try and figure out who to pick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get the list of files I’ve changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the hg log for those files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check through the log for “r=”, and “sr=”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, that’s a fairly easy set of steps to automate, and so I present
my first cut at &lt;a href="https://github.com/bwinton/Mozilla-Tools/blob/master/getReviewer.py"&gt;the automated reviewer chooser&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are a lot of things I’ld like to do with this, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improving the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checking to see how well this script would have done on previous commits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking into account the length of the queues for the reviewers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding some sort of recent-ness calculations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think that this tool is useful enough in its current state that
releasing it and getting feedback on what to actually work on would be a
win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use it, be in a mercurial source repo, and type &lt;code&gt;getReviewer.py&lt;/code&gt; to get
a list of suggested reviewers for the current differences, or
&lt;code&gt;getReviewer.py temp.diff&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;getReviewer.py
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi\?id\=536017&lt;/code&gt; to specify a
different set of changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>mozilla</category><category>review</category><category>thunderbird</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/thunderbird/reviewerchooser.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2011 00:13:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Making sure I don’t forget things.</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/thunderbird/checklists.html</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve created a couple of checklists, and would like to hear any feedback on
them.  They are a &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Bwinton/Review_Checklist"&gt;Review Checklist&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Bwinton/Commit_Checklist"&gt;Commit
Checklist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They came about after I had been working mostly on experimental add-ons for
a while, and then attempted to push a couple of reviewed fixes.  Since I
was out of practice, I managed to get something minor wrong on both of the
pushes.  (The first one failed to attribute the patch to the proper author;
The second one failed to mention the bug number in the commit message.)
Since I’m a bit of a perfectionist, this really annoyed me, and so I vowed
to write up the steps that I go through when I need to commit and push a
patch, so that I could refer to them later, since if &lt;a href="http://us.macmillan.com/thechecklistmanifesto"&gt;checklists can save
lives&lt;/a&gt;, then I figure they
can probably also help me do my job better.  But before I go to that, I
needed to review a patch, so I wrote up some of the things I look for when
I review a patch too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>checklists</category><category>commit</category><category>mozilla</category><category>review</category><category>thunderbird</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/thunderbird/checklists.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2010 00:49:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Malted Barley Flour Review</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/random/bread/maltedbarley.html</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;At the Royal Winter Fair this year, Amy picked up a small bag of
malted barley flour, because she likes the taste of malt, and because
we have a recipe for malt bread which calls for malted (not barley)
flour.  We’ve since tried to use it in a few different loaves, and
while I quite enjoy the taste, as little as a quarter of a cup will
make the bread twice as dense as usual, and incredibly sticky to
boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like it would be a useful thing to have, so that if you
had a bread that you knew was going to be a little dry for some
reason, you could just add a pinch of the stuff, and moisten it right
up, but I still haven’t figured out how little to put in to get a
slightly-moister bread which doesn’t adhere to the knife.  If I do,
I’ll be sure to post a comment, but until then, if you manage to get
some malted barley flour, be exceedingly sparing in your use of it,
and I’ll continue experimenting and picking bread out of my teeth.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>barley</category><category>bread</category><category>flour</category><category>malt</category><category>review</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/random/bread/maltedbarley.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2007 15:04:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Forecast - In The Shadow Of Two Gunmen</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/reviews/forecast.html</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;When I listened to the first song, they sounded like a band I listened
to back in university.  Something like a cross between Sloan and Live,
or The Lowest of the Low.  Live, maybe?  It wasn't any of those but
that was the sort of genre it reminds me of...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what I'm trying to say there is that as far as I can tell,
it's classic Indie Rock, circa 1994, and god help me, I love it.  I'm
sure the muscial landscape has changed in the last 12, no, wait, 13
years, but it's good to see that there are still bands out there who
are playing the things I used to hear.  Damn, does that means that I'm
old, when I start liking songs like the ones I used to hear?  I'll
just chalk it up to nostalgia instead of age.  Shut up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should probably put in &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Forecast"&gt;a link&lt;/a&gt; to more info,
shouldn't I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I know I totally missed the 1500 character target, but
man, this reviewing thing is hard.  All the harder when I'm only
listening to music at the office, where I'm really trying to
concentrate on my job, instead of on the music.  The first few times I
listened to the album, I was halfway through the following album
before I realized that I should have been listening.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>alternative</category><category>from_jessica</category><category>music</category><category>new_music</category><category>review</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/reviews/forecast.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2007 22:12:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Dieselboy - The Human Resource</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/reviews/dieselboy.html</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Pretty sweet.  They were described to me as "slightly-harder drum
and bass", which worried me a little, since I didn't know if I would
be up for something heavy, but either it was only slightly-harder, or
I don't know how hard regular drum and bass is, or I ended up being in
a heavier mood than I thought I was, because I thoroughly enjoyed the
album.  It sort of drifted into the background, which is exactly what
I'm hoping for when I listen to music at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not entirely sure what else to say here.  I suppose I could add
that they didn't seem as minimal as the Plastikman/FUSE albums I've
got, and they were a lot less sample-heavy than Mushroom Jazz by Mark
Farina, but I don't think that really tells you much about the music
itself.  Hopefully, with more exposure to some quality drum and bass,
I'll be able to give more informed opinions, but for now, I guess this
will have to be my baseline for future reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, one more thing, the next few reviews might run a little late,
because even though I've listened to the music, I only have a couple
of hundred words written about each of them, and I'm guessing that
it'll take some re-listening to think of more things to say.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>drum_and_bass</category><category>from_jon</category><category>music</category><category>new_music</category><category>review</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/reviews/dieselboy.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2007 19:16:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New Feature: Music reviews.</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/reviews/intro.html</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Since our &lt;del&gt;receptionist&lt;/del&gt; (Oops, "Office Manager") left,
and I took the opportunity to grab a copy of her entire iTunes folder,
I've been listening to a lot of new music.  Most of it is even
actually new, and not just new to 33-year old fogeys who are stuck
back in 1992.  So, along with some book reviews that I'm in the middle
of writing, I figured that I would write some reviews of the new tunes
that I've been listening to, in the hopes that it will get me posting
a little more to this weblog thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I promise to not review more than one thing per day, so as to not
overwhelm the five of you who read this weblog.  Having said that,
I've been listening to more than one thing in the past couple of days,
so I've got a few things for review queued up, which means that we'll
probably have at least one per (week-)day for the next little while.
I'm aiming for approximately 200 words per review, or more accurately
somewhere near 1500 characters, because my editor (Scite) has a count
of characters, but no word-count that I could find.  Clearly this post
isn't going to make that limit, but then again, it's not actually a
review, so I don't mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I've just realized that I lied.  I'll probably be doing some
book reviews as well, and perhaps even a review of a restaurant, if
one catches my fancy.  If I were younger, with more desposable income,
I'ld be all over the new gadget reviews, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>admin</category><category>introduction</category><category>music</category><category>review</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/reviews/intro.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2007 23:09:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
