&lt;p&gt;This started off as a response to &lt;a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/971.html"&gt;Greg's post&lt;/a&gt;,
but grew too long, so I figured I'ld put it here instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reaction I've seen from the developer community to Apple's "iPhone
Development" announcement has been poor at best.  Everyone seems to think
that it's a cop-out, and that they should have just said "We don't support
third-party development, but you can use the web."  My favourite quote has
to be from &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/06/wwdc_2007_keynote"&gt;John Gruber&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If all you have to offer is a shit sandwich,
just say it. Don't tell us how lucky we are and that it's going to taste
delicious.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Maybe it's because I'm an old fuddy-duddy, but I
don't think the Web 2.0 development is really the wave of the future.  I
think the future, like the past, will have desktop apps, client-server apps
with both thick and thin clients, where the server may be a web server or
may not, etc, etc...

&lt;p&gt;And Javascript is still missing the extreme number of useful libraries
that the other three languages have.  Like &lt;a href="http://ironfroggy-code.blogspot.com/2007/06/python-ironpython-apples-and-oranges.html"&gt;Calvin Spealman&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Does syntax alone make a language?
Maybe one day it could, but those days died out. Python is far more than
its clean, beautiful syntax. The libraries that come in the standard
library provide even more value. As a foundation for all the software built
on top, these packages are fundamental to the success of
Python.&lt;/blockquote&gt;and I find that to be true over and over again.  Java
the language kind of sucks.  But the huge number of libraries to do just
about anything I want really rocks.  (And the IDEs are sweet too, which is
a good thing, since trying to write Java without an IDE would give even a
super-robot a serious case of carpal tunnel syndrome.)

&lt;p&gt;Which is not to say that there won't be more and more libraries shipped
with Javascript, but then again, since it's mainly a web-language, the
browser makers will want to keep it light, and so the libraries won't be
part of the language proper, as they are with Python or Java, and any
"standard" library you see will be vendor-specific, just like it is today.
(I already write some Javascript scripts for my day job, but I know that
they're going to run on a Windows box.  I have no idea how to write the
cross-platform equivalent of stuff like:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if ( FS.FileExists( flavour + "\\gamelist.txt" ) )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
or:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;WScript.Echo( "Unhandled folder: " + fname );&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
much less:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var WSHShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell");
var cmdline = "jar.exe xvf " + item + " META-INF/MANIFEST.MF";
WSHShell.Run( cmdline, ActivateAndHide, true );&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Any suggestions?

&lt;p&gt;And while I'm here, that red "J" was the best thing I could come up with
for a Javascript logo, after extensive web searching.  (There's a reason
I'm a programmer, and not a graphics person.)  Anyone seen anything
better?&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>greg_wilson</category><category>iphone</category><category>javascript</category><category>reply</category><category>svg</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/javascript.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jun 2007 17:32:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Thoughts from a cyclist in the rain.</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/random/biking/thoughts.html</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div style="width:6.53em; height:3.79em; float:right"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a certain point, you don't really get any wetter.&lt;br&gt;
Even though it's really cold, and I'm totally soaking, it's not a bad ride.&lt;br&gt;
Wow, it takes a long time to stop.  (I already knew this, and I'm going way slower than I normally would, but that doesn't make it any less true.)&lt;br&gt;
I could probably do with a new pair of biking gloves.&lt;br&gt;
The headband I stole from Amy is working wonderfully, though.&lt;br&gt;
I hereby transfer all the karma I got from giving my tires to &lt;a href="http://www.bikepirates.com/"&gt;Bike Pirates&lt;/a&gt; to the nice person in the car (a Beemer, even!) who let me turn left into the cemetary front of them.&lt;br&gt;
Although, thinking about it, I might not have that much karma left, since I'm biking on the sidewalk.  (Up Mount Pleasant beside the Cemetary.  In this weather, there's no way I would feel safe on the road, and there aren't any cross roads or pedestrians, so I'm probably way safer than I would normally be on the sidewalk.)  &lt;a href="http://www.michaelwalker.ca/"&gt;Mr. Walker&lt;/a&gt;, a bike lane down Mount Pleasant would be most appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>biking</category><category>rain</category><category>svg</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/random/biking/thoughts.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 May 2007 00:53:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Just checking some inline SVG.</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/blake/tech/doesthisworkforyou.html</link><dc:creator>Blake Winton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div style="width:6.25em; height:6.25em; float:right"&gt;
