today, just after crossing the railroad bridge, heading on to
Summerhill, I noticed a man poking at his bicycle.  I stopped, and
asked if he needed a hand, and sure enough, he did.  He seemed to have
gotten his chain wedged around his &lt;a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_bo-z.html#bottom"&gt;Bottom
bracket&lt;/a&gt;, in such a way that the arms of the &lt;a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_sp-ss.html#spider"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt;
were attempting to push the top and bottom pieces of the chain
&lt;i&gt;through&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ch.html#chainstay"&gt;chainstay&lt;/a&gt;.  That obviously wasn’t working, so I grabbed my
multitool, and attempted to use the largest &lt;a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_aa-l.html#allen"&gt;Allen key&lt;/a&gt;
to try to lever it out.  When that too failed, I pulled out the one
tool in my collection I’ve never used: The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_tool"&gt;Chain Tool&lt;/a&gt;.  After
a few tries, I eventually got the chain apart, after which it was an
not-so-easy matter of threading it out through the gap between the
spider and the chainstay, re-threading it onto the &lt;a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ch.html#chainring"&gt;chainring&lt;/a&gt;,
and re-connecting it.  As a final gesture of goodwill/parting gift, I
gave him my last 2007 &lt;a href="http://www.toronto.ca/cycling/map/index.htm"&gt;Bike Map&lt;/a&gt;.
(Yeah, I know the link is to the 2006 page.  They really have to
update that sometime...)  After all that, I got to the office 15
minutes late.  (Well, 15 minutes later.  I didn’t have a meeting or
anything, and our core hours don’t start until 10:00.)  But I’ve got
to say, that was 15 minutes well spent, since it made the rest of my
ride in seem extra-pleasant.&lt;br clear="both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>biking</category><category>nice</category><category>tools</category><guid>https://weblog.latte.ca/blake/random/biking/thehandsofkarma.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 Aug 2007 17:14:38 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
