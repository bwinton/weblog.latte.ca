household".  I suppose a loose interpretation of that would be that any and
all info on this site is being broadcast from a server at said
"Brown-Winton household".  With that in mind, lets consider me the roving
reporter. . .  No, National Correspondant!  Much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woody here, coming to you live from Victoria, British Columbia.  Yah.
Well, today I have a job interview.  This is a good thing.  This will bring
me inside for the rainy winter, as I am currently a construction labourer.
Winters on Salt Spring are very wet, and I have developed many bruises from
working with hand tools on cold mornings.  Keyboards are much more
forgiving.  Not to say you can't get bruised by a keyboard.  Call blake "My
Bitch" before he's had his morning latte, and this point will be
illustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with any luck, I will be doing QA for a company that writes
interfaces between ECG machines and allows for a person at one location to
bw monitored by a doctor at another location, while the data is being
stored at another.  Sounds pretty cool.  I've been missing my geek fix, so,
although I'd prefer to be doing admin on *nix systems, QA on VB will do. .
.  Hush, you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, shower, off to print resume, off to get a Sally Bun (oh, you'll
hear more about Sally Buns in the future), then interview, then hook up
with an old buddy, then a we design contract meeting, then a squash game.
Full day, eh?  And still, I take the time to keep you updated.  Damn,
that's one fine fellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One (or two) last thing(s) before I go.  First, I haven't had my coffee.
This should explain my otherwise cryptic use of "paragraphs" in this post.
I judt kind of start a new one when the urge strikes me (as opposed to
Blake's keyboard).  Second, well, I always allow for another point when
saying how many I'll have.  That leaves room in case anything comes to mind
while prattling off the first. In this instance, there is no second, but if
there had been, I'd have been set.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>woody</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/woody/interview.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2003 15:28:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Even shorter update</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/woody/working2.html</link><dc:creator>Scott “Woody” Wood</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I had my days mixed up last week.  All day Tuesday, I thought it was
Wednesday.  All day Wednesday, I thought it was Thursday.  Needless to say,
my meeting was supposed to be Thursday night and Friday was my first day of
work.  Good thing, too.  I got a free day out of the deal.  Also, now that
I have a 9-5, Monday to Friday job, I might even be able to keep track of
what day of the week it is!
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>woody</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/woody/working2.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2003 20:37:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Short update folks from our BC office today, folks.</title><link>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/woody/working.html</link><dc:creator>Scott “Woody” Wood</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I got a job.  I start tomorrow.  Network and Systems administration for
a small software development shop.  Sound familiar anyone?  Funny enough,
much like my interview with my previous employer, I was welcomed to the
interview for this job by a big dog.  I like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other related, but less humble news, I have actually worked a couple
of days for these people already.  They brought me in for a 2 day trial.
There was another fellow due to come in for 2 days after me, but once I'd
been there for a day and a half, they called the other guy and told him not
to bother coming in.  The position has been filled.  Woah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I have a web design contract I have to round out for a client
by 7 this eve, so I think I should step off and be productive.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>woody</category><guid>https://bwinton.github.io/weblog.latte.ca/woody/working.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2003 21:08:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
